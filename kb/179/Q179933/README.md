	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95 installs Quickshelf 95 and adds the Lookup Reference
	command to the Tools menu in Word 97. However, Bookshelf 95 does not add the
	Define command to the shortcut menu in Word 97.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To add the Define command to the shortcut menu in Word 97, follow these steps:
	
	1. Quit Word 97.
	
	2. Insert the Bookshelf 95 CD-ROM or the Microsoft Office 95 Disk 1 CD-ROM into
	  the CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down the SHIFT key when you insert the
	  CD-ROM to prevent Bookshelf or Office from starting automatically.
	
	3. Copy the Bsh32.wll file from the Office folder on the Bookshelf 95 CD-ROM, or
	  the Aamstp32\App32 folder on the Office 95 Disk 1 CD-ROM to the following
	  location:
	
	     <drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Startup
	
	  where <drive> is the letter of the hard disk on which Word 97 is
	  installed.
	
	For information about how to copy a file in Microsoft Windows 95, click Start,
	click Help, click the Index tab, type "copying" (without the quotation marks),
	click "Files or Folders," click Display, click "Copying a File or Folder," and
	then click Display.
	
	NOTE: You cannot integrate the 16-bit version of Bookshelf 95 for Windows with
	Word 97. To determine which version of Bookshelf 95 you own, look at the label
	on your Bookshelf 95 CD-ROM. The 16-bit version of Bookshelf 95 has a "Microsoft
	Windows Compatible" logo on the cover of the CD-ROM jewel case booklet, while
	the 32-bit version of Bookshelf 95 has a "Designed for Windows 95" logo on the
	cover of the CD-ROM jewel case booklet. Microsoft Office Professional 95
	includes the 32-bit version of Bookshelf 95.
	
	If you own the 16-bit version of Bookshelf 95, you can request a copy of the
	32-bit version of Bookshelf 95 while supplies last. To do so, contact Microsoft
	Sales at (800) 360-7561.
