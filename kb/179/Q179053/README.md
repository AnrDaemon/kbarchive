	When you install Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 on a computer running Microsoft
	Windows NT Workstation 4.0, the Flight Simulator Setup program creates shortcuts
	in the Microsoft Games common folder. (This Microsoft Games menu is located
	below the separator line at the bottom of the Programs menu.)
	
	If you install the Flight Shop Converter for Flight Simulator, (also called the
	Aircraft/Adventure Converter), the Converter Setup program creates shortcuts in
	a Microsoft Games folder that is accessible only to the current user. (This
	Microsoft Games menu is located above the separator line at the bottom of the
	Programs menu.)

	Flight Shop Converter Setup programs create shortcuts in the same Microsoft
	Games menu, regardless of whether user profiles are in use.
