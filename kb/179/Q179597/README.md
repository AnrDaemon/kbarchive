	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	What is the "Allow A4/Letter paper resizing" setting?
	
	For some countries, the standard paper size is Letter; for others, the standard
	size is A4. You would select this check box if you want Word to automatically
	adjust documents formatted for another country's standard paper size (for
	example, A4) so they print correctly on your country's standard paper size (for
	example, Letter). This option affects the printout only, not the formatting in
	your document.
