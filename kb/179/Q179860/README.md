	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The APPC Session Viewer tool in Microsoft SNA Server may not correctly read the
	registry in all cases. This can cause some properties to be displayed as an
	error in the status window of the tool.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The APPC Session Viewer tool fails to reset an internal counter, which causes
	the registry to be read incorrectly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
	SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.
	
	This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
	Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
	word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

	A supported fix for SNA Server version 4.0 is now available, but has not been
	fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
	specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
	Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
	fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
