	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The DirectX tool in Control Panel is used by software developers to troubleshoot
	DirectX-based programs. Developers use this tool to disable DirectX features and
	test for problems that result. This process enables developers to determine what
	issues you may encounter when you use a program that uses DirectX features. The
	DirectX tool does not add any new features or functionality to programs.
	
	If you use the DirectX tool improperly, you may damage your program's files or be
	unable to run your program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The DirectX tool in Control Panel is part of the DirectX Software Development
	Kit (SDK). We do not recommend you install the SDK unless you are a software
	developer.
