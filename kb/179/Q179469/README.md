	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The "Microsoft Windows 98 Official Preview Kit" includes a great deal of
	information about the forthcoming Windows 98 product and is written from the
	point of view of a user of Windows 98. However, the CD-ROM does not include a
	beta copy of Microsoft Windows 98.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The companion CD-ROM includes Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and several beta
	programs from Microsoft Press Interactive: Microsoft Windows 98 Overview and
	Microsoft Windows 98 Starts Here. However, the beta software is only available
	through the Microsoft Windows 98 beta program.
	
	The "beta release" element on the front cover, back cover, and spine of the book
	refers to the fact that Microsoft Windows 98 has not yet been released. It does
	not refer to a product specifically included with the book.
