	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you fly the LearJet 45 in Flight Simulator 98, the frame rate (the speed at
	which images are drawn on the screen, usually measured in frames per second) may
	be reduced. As a result, the motion of the airplane may not appear smooth.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because the instrument panel of the LearJet 45 requires
	more system resources than the instrument panels of the other airplanes included
	with Flight Simulator 98.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this behavior, configure Flight Simulator 98 to use less system
	resources.
