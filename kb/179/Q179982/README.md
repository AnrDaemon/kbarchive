	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Windows NT does not support the ability to route multicast packets, or
	to act as a multicast TCP/IP server.
	
	Windows NT can receive multicast packets as a client for use with a program such
	as Microsoft NetShow, but it cannot act as a server or router of multicast
	packets.
