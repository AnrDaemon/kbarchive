	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are in full-screen mode (on the Edit menu, click Full Screen), the Word
	menu bar fails to automatically hide after activating and closing an inserted
	OLE object.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, close and re-enter full-screen mode.
	
	To turn off full-screen mode and switch to the previous view, click Close Full
	Screen on the Full Screen toolbar or press ESC.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To display as much of your document as possible on the screen, you can switch to
	full-screen mode. In this mode, Word removes distracting screen elements, such
	as toolbars and scroll bars.
	
	NOTE: If you want to choose menu commands in full-screen mode, rest the pointer
	at the top of the document window, and the menu bar appears. For example, you
	may want to set options on the View tab (Tools menu, Options command) to specify
	which screen elements to display in full-screen mode.
	
	Additional query words: autohide view
