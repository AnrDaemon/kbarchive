	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you place the Zoom command on a toolbar, you see different choices as
	compared to the Zoom command on a menu. By default, Word places the Zoom command
	on the Formatting toolbar, Print Preview toolbar, and on the View menu of all
	Word views.
	
	When you are in either Page Layout or Print Preview view and you click the Zoom
	list on the Formatting or Print Preview toolbars, you see the following
	choices:
	
	  500%
	  200%
	  150%
	  100%
	  75%
	  50%
	  25%
	  10%
	  Page Width
	  Whole Page
	  Two Pages
	
	When you click the Zoom command on the View menu from any Word view, you see the
	following choices:
	
	  200%
	  100%
	  75%
	  Page Width
	  Whole Page
	  Many Pages
	  (Customize %)
	
	NOTE: The Zoom command on the toolbar gives you the choice of Two Pages, while
	the Zoom command on the View menu gives you the choice of Many Pages; whereby,
	you can view multiple pages of your document. When you follow the steps in the
	"Workaround" section of this article, the Zoom button on the toolbar will
	provide the same choices as the Zoom command on the View menu.
