	design, changes in your custom template may not be inserted into your new
	document. This problem occurs even when you have correctly applied the proper
	styles in your custom template.
	
	NOTE: To select a custom page design, change the "Choose a page design" box to
	your custom letter template on the Letter Format tab.

	  and then press ENTER.
	
	2. In the Office Assistant, click "Get help with writing the letter."
