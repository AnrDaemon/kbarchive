	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some programs provide the ability to password protect files created in that
	program. Microsoft PowerPoint does not provide any password protection
	capabilities for presentations.
	
	PowerPoint also does not provide the ability to protect the contents of a
	presentation from modification. You cannot have a presentation which you can
	view but not edit. When you open a PowerPoint presentation you can always edit
	the contents.
	
	NOTE: PowerPoint 98 does provide the ability to password protect macro code
	stored within a presentation.
