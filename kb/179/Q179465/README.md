	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some of the graphics or links in the "Microsoft Windows 98 Official Preview Kit"
	HTML files may not appear or function correctly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The "Microsoft Windows 98 Official Preview Kit" CD-ROM was duplicated using long
	filenames and filenames containing spaces and lowercase letters. CD- ROM drives
	that use older MS-DOS drivers will not see these filenames correctly.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Contact your CD-ROM drive manufacturer to obtain an updated driver for your
	CD-ROM drive.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS cannot read CD-ROM filenames that contain
	spaces or lowercase letters. However, later versions of Microsoft Windows,
	including Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, use updated CD-ROM drivers to
	allow spaces, lowercase letters, and long filenames.
	
	Because Windows 95 permits extended CD-ROM filenames, it does not have problems
	reading the CD-ROM for this book. However, Windows 95 configurations that use
	MS-DOS CD-ROM drivers will not be able to access the extended CD-ROM filenames
	on this CD-ROM.
