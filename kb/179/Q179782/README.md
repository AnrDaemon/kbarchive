	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Section 1.3.1 of the Olereadme.rtf file included on the Microsoft Outlook 8.03
	compact disc incorrectly states that it is possible to create a set of disks for
	installing Microsoft Outlook. The text of this section is as follows:
	
	  1.3.1 Setting Up Microsoft Outlook from Disks
	
	  Microsoft Outlook software can be set up on portable computers using
	  disks. Once you have copied the client software to preformatted disks,
	  you can set up Microsoft Outlook on a client computer by clicking
	  Setup.exe. The Setup program will prompt you to insert additional disks
	  when necessary.
	
	  To create a set of Setup disks
	
	  1. From the Microsoft Outlook compact disc, select the subdirectory for
	     the language you want, and then select the directory for the client
	     platform on which you will be setting up Microsoft Outlook.
	
	  2. Copy the Exchng1.cab to your first disk, along with the other
	     non-.cab files. Then copy Exchng2.cab to your second disk, and so on,
	     until you have copied all the client files to disks.
