	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create a new document based on a custom template (on the File menu,
	click New), the preview of your new document does not show changes made to your
	custom template.
	
	NOTE: This problem also occurs when you use the Letter Wizard. The Page Design
	preview may not show the changes made to your custom template.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The preview of your new document is shown by an AutoText entry named Gallery
	Example. The Gallery Example for your custom template has not been changed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To change or update the Gallery Example in your custom template, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Open your custom template.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Select All.
	
	3. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText.
	
	4. In the AutoText list, click Gallery Example, and then click Delete.
	
	5. In the "Enter AutoText entries here" box, type "Gallery Example" (without the
	  quotation marks), and then click Add.
	
	6. Save and close the custom template.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A template can store boilerplate text, custom toolbars, macros, shortcut keys,
	styles, and AutoText entries. An easy way to create a template is by opening a
	document that contains the items you want to reuse and saving it as a template.
	
	For more information about creating a custom template, click the Office
	Assistant, type "How do I create a template," click Search, and then click to
	view "Create a template."
	
	NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
	Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
