	================
	
	The following are the supported platforms for the SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4
	clients:
	
	SNA Server Client for Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 98:
	
	- Windows 95
	
	- Windows 98
	
	- Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me)
	
	- Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
	
	- Windows 2000 Professional

	SNA Server 4.0 was originally released in November 1997. The latest service pack
	for SNA Server 4.0 is Service Pack 4, which was released in November 2000.
	Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 was released in August 2000 as the next
	release of SNA Server.
	
	Since the release of Windows XP, in October 2001, a decision was made to
	concentrate on Host Integration Server 2000 and its compatibility with Windows
	XP Professional. Based on this decision, compatibility testing for the SNA
	Server 4.0 clients on Windows XP has not occurred. There are no plans to do this
	testing in the future.
