	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Each DLC 802.2 link service that is installed on an SNA Server or Host
	Integration Server 2000 system has a unique link service name. The DLC 802.2
	link service names are generated by using a base 16 algorithm with a one-digit
	index or a two-digit index, as shown in the following list:
	
	    SnaDlc1...SnaDlc9
	    SnaDlcA...SnaDlcF
	    SnaDlc10...SnaDlc19
	    SnaDlc1A...SnaDlc1F
	    SnaDlc20...SnaDlc29
	    SnaDlc2A...SnaDlc2F
	    SnaDlc30...SnaDlc39
	    SnaDlc3A...SnaDlc3F
	    ...
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	DLC 802.2 link service names in SNA Server 2.11 are generated by using a base 36
	algorithm with a one-digit index or a two-digit index, as shown in the following
	list:
	
	    SnaDlc1...SnaDlc9
	    SnaDlcA...SnaDlcZ
	    SnaDlc10...SnaDlc19
	    SnaDlc1A...SnaDlc1Z
	    SnaDlc20...SnaDlc29
	    SnaDlc2A...SnaDlc2Z
	    SnaDlc30...SnaDlc39
	    SnaDlc3A...SnaDlc3Z
	    ...
	
	The SNA Server 2.11 naming algorithm for the DLC 802.2 link service names is
	described in the following Knowledge Base article:

	Because the DLC 802.2 link service name algorithm has changed, you may have to
	remove, re-add, or reconfigure some DLC 802.2 link services or Distributed Link
	Services (DLS) when you upgrade SNA Server systems that have DLC 802.2 link
	services and the SNA Server 2.11 link service name format.
