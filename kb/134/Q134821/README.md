	                        Processing input from the keyboard is relatively
	                        straightforward. This month, Jeff Prosise shows

	                        maps, manipulate the caret, and code text entry
	                        and text editing operations with a sample

	                        heaps. Other information that used to be obtained

	                        video clips. The client breaks the video into
	                        segments, dispatches the segments to multiple
	                        servers for compression, and then reassembles the
