	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of Nature for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of People for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you install Explorapedia, World of Nature, version 1.0, and afterwards
	install Explorapedia, World of People, version 1.1, you find that when you run
	World of Nature, and you press CTRL+SHIFT+I, it displays
	
	  Microsoft Explorapedia, World of Nature, version 1.1
	
	when it should display Microsoft Explorapedia, World of Nature.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This occurs when Explorapedia, World of People has been installed after
	installing World of Nature. Explorapedia, World of People Setup overwrites the
	configuration files in the Explora folder. World of Nature recognizes these
	files and incorporates them when it is run.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Explorapedia, The World of
	People, version 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
