## Q134457: PPT7: Files Saved in Outline View Open in Slide View

	Article: Q134457
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a PowerPoint version 2.0 through 4.0 presentation in PowerPoint
	for Windows 95, version 7.0, it always opens in Slide View. This happens even if
	you were in Slide Sorter, Outline, Handout, or Title (PowerPoint 2.0 only) view
	when you saved the original presentation.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you open an earlier version presentation in PowerPoint for Windows 95, it
	is converted to PowerPoint for Windows 95 format. The converter always changes
	the view of the presentation to Slide View. The reverse is also true. When you
	save a presentation from PowerPoint for Windows 95 as a PowerPoint 4.0
	presentation, it opens the PowerPoint 4.0 presentation in Slide View, regardless
	of what view the presentation was saved in.
