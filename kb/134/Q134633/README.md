	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. If I upgrade to Windows 95 from Windows for Workgroups, do I need to
	  create a new postoffice or can I continue to use the same postoffice?
	
	  A. You can continue to use the existing Windows for Workgroups postoffice.
	  This postoffice can be administered using the Workgroup Postoffice Admin tool
	  in Control Panel in Windows 95.
	
	2. Q. How do I set up and administer a postoffice?
	
	  A. To set up and administer a postoffice, follow these steps:
	
	  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  2. Double-click the Microsoft Mail Postoffice icon.
	
	  You can use this tool to create a new postoffice and to administer an existing
	  postoffice. This tool works with postoffices created in Windows for
	  Workgroups, Windows NT, and Windows 95.
	
	3. Q. Can I use and administer multiple postoffices?
	
	  A. You can set up and administer multiple Microsoft Exchange postoffices;
	  however, you cannot exchange e-mail between them. That is, everyone connected
	  to an individual postoffice can exchange e- mail with one another, but cannot
	  exchange e-mail with people on a different postoffice.
	
	  NOTE: Microsoft Mail 3.x servers do provide the ability to exchange e-mail
	  between multiple postoffices.
	
	4. Q. Can I administer a postoffice from a computer that I did not use to create
	  it?
	
	  A. Yes. You can administer a Microsoft Exchange postoffice from any other
	  Windows 95-based computer on the network, provided you have the Microsoft
	  Mail services installed and you have the proper administrator account and
	  password information.
	
	5. Q. Can I create a postoffice on a Novell NetWare server?
	
	  A. Yes, provided that you can connect to the NetWare server and that you have
	  full rights (such as file scan and modify) to the directory in which you want
	  to create the postoffice.
	
	6. Q. Can I use Universal Naming Convention (UNC) names to set up a postoffice
	  on a Novell NetWare server?
	
	  A. Windows 95 supports the use of UNC names for NetWare servers if you use the
	  protected-mode Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks. You cannot use UNC
	  names if you use Novell's NETX or VLM redirector.
	
	7. Q. Do I need to have an account on the postoffice before I try to connect to
	  it using Microsoft Exchange?
	
	  A. Yes. After you specify the path to the postoffice, the Setup Wizard
	  presents a list of accounts so you can choose yours.
