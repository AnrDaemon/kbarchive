## Q134780: PPT7: Action Item Slides Not Written from Embedded Presentation

	Article: Q134780
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:7.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbole
	Last Modified: 25-NOV-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You can embed one presentation within another in Microsoft PowerPoint. If you
	use Meeting Minder to record Action Items or Meeting Minutes while in an
	embedded presentation, that information is not written to the Action Items or
	Meeting Minutes slides that are generated at the end of the main presentation.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you show an embedded presentation object, you are playing it. In
	PowerPoint, you cannot change an embedded OLE object at the same time you play
	it. Therefore, you cannot add or change slides to an embedded presentation while
	it is being shown.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use Meeting Minder when you are in the main portion of a presentation; do not
	use it when you are in an embedded presentation.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
