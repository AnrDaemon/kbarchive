	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click Properties on the File menu in PowerPoint for Windows 95, version
	7.0, and look at the Contents tab, you may see a single font listed several
	times in the Fonts Used section.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This occurs when you have a font in the presentation that is present in several
	variations. Times New Roman Bold, Times New Roman Italic, and Times New Roman
	Bold Italic are all variations of Times New Roman and are actually different
	fonts. If you use, for example, the Bold and Bold Italic variations of Arial in
	your presentation, Arial will be listed twice on the Contents tab of the
	properties for that presentation.
