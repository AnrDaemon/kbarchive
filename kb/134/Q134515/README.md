	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you receive one of the following error messages in Scandisk and the error
	message dialog box has only a Cancel button, you cannot close the error message
	dialog box by pressing the ESC or ENTER keys:
	
	  ScanDisk could not write to this disk because it is write protected. Remove
	  the write-protect tab, reinsert the disk, and then restart ScanDisk.
	
	  ScanDisk cannot continue because the disk it was checking was removed from the
	  drive. Reinsert the disk, and then restart ScanDisk.
	
	  The compressed volume file for this drive is too small. It must be at least
	  512K in size. This may be caused by an error on your host drive, which is the
	  uncompressed drive on which the compressed volume file is stored. For
	  information about how to continue, click Help.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In Scandisk, some of the error message dialog boxes that have only a Cancel
	button do not have the standard keyboard shortcut associated with the button.

	1. Use the mouse pointer to click the CANCEL button.
