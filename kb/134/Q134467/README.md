	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start the game, El Fish, by Maxis, you may receive the following
	message
	
	  EL-FISH started. Wait please...
	
	and then the program appears to stop responding.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you start the game, El Fish, the game tries to calibrate the speed of the
	computer. This calibration fails if you have a computer with a Pentium
	processor.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, run the game in MS-DOS mode. To do so, follow
	these steps:
	
	1. In My Computer, using the right mouse button, click the El Fish icon, and
	  then click Properties on the menu that appears.
	
	2. In the El Fish Properties dialog box, click the Program tab, and then click
	  the Advanced button.
	
	3. In the Advanced Program Settings dialog box, make sure the MS-DOS mode box is
	  checked.
	
	4. Select the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration button.
	
	5. Click the OK button in all the dialog boxes that appear.
	
	If the game still does not start properly, contact the program vendor.
