	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you convert an uncompressed drive that is almost full to a compressed
	drive using DriveSpace, you may receive the following error message when you run
	ScanDisk:
	
	  The ratio that Windows is using to estimate the amount of free space
	  available on this drive is too high. As a result, Windows reports that your
	  disk contains more free space than it actually does. To change the ratio,
	  click the help button, and then carry out the procedure for changing your
	  compression ratio.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The DriveSpace conversion tool automatically sets the estimated compression
	ratio to 2:1. In some rare cases, this ratio is too high.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, follow the instructions on the screen to change the
	compression ratio.
