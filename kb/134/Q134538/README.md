	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The real mode network drivers for Novell NetWare do not ship with Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you are prompted for the NetWare files, you must provide their location.
	The files may be located on your hard drive or on a floppy disk. For example,
	some of the files that are required are NetWare.hlp, Vipx.386, Nwpopup.exe, and
	VnetWare.386.
	
	The first dialog box, prompting you for the NetWare files, reads as follows:
	
	  The file NETWARE.HLP on Novell NetWare Windows driver disk
	  could not be found. Insert Novell NetWare Windows driver disk into
	  the drive selected below, and click OK.
	
	The second dialog box, prompting you for the Netware.drv file, reads as follows:
	
	  The disk labeled 'Novell NetWare 3.x Windows driver disk' is now
	  required. This disk is provided by your computer manufacturer.
	
	In this dialog box, the words "provided by your computer manufacturer" are
	misleading. The disk is provided by a software vendor or reseller.
	
	If you do not have the necessary files, you must obtain them from Novell.
	Microsoft does not provide the NetWare files.
	
	NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
