	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can change the look of your PowerPoint presentation by applying different
	presentation designs (also called design templates). Sometimes you may want to
	remove or clear the template, or restore a presentation so that it uses the
	default PowerPoint presentation design format.
	
	To restore the default presentation format, apply the Design Template called
	Blank Presentation.pot. This template is located in the Msoffice\Templates or
	C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates folder.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If Blank Presentation.pot template has been changed or corrupted, you can
	regenerate a default Blank Presentation.pot by following these steps:
	
	1. Rename the existing Blank Presentation.pot file.
	
	2. Start PowerPoint.
	
	3. In the Startup dialog box, click Blank Presentation, and click OK.
	
	4. In the New Slide dialog box, click one of the AutoLayout choices to select
	  it, and click OK.
	
	5. On the File menu, click Save.
	
	6. Name the file Blank Presentation and click Presentation Templates in the Save
	  As Type list.
	
	7. Ensure that you are about to save to the Templates folder, and then click
	  Save.
	
	This process is similar to the way that earlier versions of PowerPoint provide
	default formatting. In earlier versions, however, the file that contains the
	formatting is called Default.ppt rather than Blank Presentation.pot. The .pot
	extension indicates a PowerPoint template file format.
