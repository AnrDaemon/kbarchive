	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play the "_Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark?_" game, version 1.0 (by
	Viacom/Nickelodeon), the sound effects are choppy and you hear a buzzing.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The program is using memory in a way that conflicts with the sound effects.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, run the program in MS-DOS mode. To do so, follow
	these steps:
	
	1. In My Computer, using the right mouse button, click the _Are_You_ Afraid_
	  of_the_Dark?_ icon, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.
	
	2. In the _Are_You_Afraid_of_the_Dark?_ Properties dialog box, click the Program
	  tab, and then click the Advanced button.
	
	3. Make sure the MS-DOS mode box is checked.
	
	4. Select the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration button.
	
	5. Click the OK button on all the dialog boxes that appear.
	
	To run the program, double-click the program icon or click the Start button,
	click Run, and then type the program name in the Run dialog box. If you type the
	program name at an MS-DOS prompt, the program's settings are not invoked.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition, you may have to reinstall sound card, mouse, and CD-ROM support.
	Use standard MS-DOS-mode troubleshooting techniques to resolve any problems.
