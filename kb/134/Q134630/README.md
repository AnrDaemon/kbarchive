	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are signing up for MSN, The Microsoft Network and downloading telephone
	numbers, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  No longer connected to The Microsoft Network. Please try to connect again.
	
	The message disappears after a few seconds and the screen asking "Do you want
	full Internet access?" is displayed. After you click Yes or No and click OK, the
	access number screen is displayed. The telephone numbers shown are the sign-up
	numbers (toll-free 1-800 numbers).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The connection to MSN was broken before the updated phone book was completely
	downloaded.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, run the MSN sign-up program again. To do so, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	2. In the Open box, type "signup.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then
	  click OK. Allow the sign-up program to dial in using the 1-800 number.
	
	3. Click Change and then select access numbers for your area.
	
	NOTE: It is important that you select access numbers. You cannot sign in to MSN
	using the sign-up numbers.
