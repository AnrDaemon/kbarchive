	SYMPTOMS
	========

	cannot make another connection.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Using HyperTerminal, you can have only one open connection per instance.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you have one modem, disconnect from the current session before dialing a
	second session. If you have multiple modems, you can open other instances of
	HyperTerminal, and then make a connection in each instance.
