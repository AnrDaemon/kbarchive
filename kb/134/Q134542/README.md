	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On some Cirrus Logic-based laptops, Extended Video (VESA) programs may not
	display correctly.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To eliminate the display problems, run the VESA programs in Single MS-DOS
	Application Mode. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt on
	  the menu that appears.
	
	2. In the MS-DOS Prompt dialog box, click the Properties button.
	
	3. In the MS-DOS Prompt Properties dialog box, click the Program tab, and then
	  click the Advanced button.
	
	4. In the Advanced Program Settings dialog box, make sure the MS-DOS Mode box is
	  checked, and then click the OK button.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Typically, a VESA program is displayed only on the top half of the screen,
	overlapping itself. The program generally remains functional, and you are able
	to quit the program properly.
