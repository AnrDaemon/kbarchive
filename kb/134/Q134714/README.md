	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	The Systems Management Server Inventory Processor may take a long time to process
	very large .MIF files. MIF files with large group tables (800 rows or more), may
	take hours to process. Additionally, the Inventory Processor may use significant
	amounts of CPU time as it processes the .MIF file.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
