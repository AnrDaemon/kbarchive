	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	There is no option for duplex printing in the properties for Hewlett- Packard
	(HP) LaserJet 4+ and 4M+ printers, although the printers themselves do support
	duplex printing.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Duplex printing is not supported in the Windows 95 drivers for these printers.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:
	
	- Check with Hewlett-Packard about obtaining an updated Windows 95 driver for
	  your printer.
	
	- Install a Windows 95 driver for a similar printer that does support duplex
	  printing.
	
	   - For the HP LaserJet 4M+, use the PostScript driver for the same model.
	
	   - For the HP LaserJet 4+, use the LaserJet 4Si driver.
