	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Multimedia tool in Control Panel, the Playback and Recording
	volume controls and the Show Volume Control check box may be unavailable.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if you are using a CrystalWare sound card. The Windows
	3.1 drivers for the CrystalWare sound card are not completely compatible with
	the Windows 95 API set.

	==========
	
	To adjust the playback and recording sound levels, use the Volume Control tool
	(Sndvol32.exe) included with Windows 95. To enable the Show Volume Control check
	box, contact the sound card manufacturer about obtaining updated drivers that
	correct the problem.
