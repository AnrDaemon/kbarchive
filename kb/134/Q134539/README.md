	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The compact disc version of the program uses MS-DOS utilities that are no longer
	part of Windows 95. You may receive the "Incorrect DOS version" error messages
	if you still have an older MS-DOS version installed on the computer, in which
	case the old version is run by mistake. You may receive the "Bad command or file
	name" error messages if you have no previous version of MS-DOS installed on the
	computer, or if Windows 95 cannot find it.
