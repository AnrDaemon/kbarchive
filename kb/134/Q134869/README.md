	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you include a footer on a PowerPoint slide, the footer text may run into
	the slide number and/or the date.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Text boxes on the Slide Master control the preset locations of the date, footer,
	and slide number. These are provided for easy access and formatting. If you
	enter too much text in the footer box, the text may collide with the text from
	the date and/or slide number boxes if they are also present.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, click Slide Master on the View menu, and then move
	or resize the date, slide number, header, and footer placeholders.
	
	REFERENCES
	==========
	
	For more information about formatting text frames, click Contents And Index on
	the Help menu, click the Index tab in PowerPoint Help, type the following text
	
	  "resizing objects" (without the quotation marks)
	
	double-click the selected text, and then double-click "Resize or crop an object"
	to go to the "Resize or crop an object" topic.
