	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run a text-mode mouse program, such as the Multi-Edit editor, as a
	full-screen program, the mouse pointer may slowly move toward the upper-left
	corner of the screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Programs that repeatedly adjust the text-conditional mouse region may experience
	this behavior. Programs that run in graphics mode are not affected.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, press ALT+ENTER to run the program in a window.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
	as it becomes available.
