	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of Nature for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Explorapedia, World of People, you notice that Little Kids
	Mode is now available in Explorapedia, World of Nature, where it did not
	previously exist.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	World of Nature did not have a Little Kids Mode, which was added to the
	functionality of World of People. Because World of Nature and World of People
	share files, this functionality is also shared once you install World of
	People.
	
	STEPS TO REPRODUCE
	------------------
	
	1. Run Explorapedia, World of Nature, version 1.0.
	
	2. Once in the program, Tad asks you what you want to do.
	
	3. Click Something Else, then click Change Settings.
	
	4. In the Settings list, you see Little Kids Mode as one of your choices.
