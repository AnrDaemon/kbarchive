	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Pressing CTRL+ESC when the Logon dialog box is displayed opens the Tasks dialog
	box, from which you can run programs.
	
	This can be a problem if the System Administrator has set the "Logon must be
	validated" policy, since the Tasks dialog box allows users to run programs
	before logging on.
