	When you are using The Microsoft Network Explorer, you can use the
	following keys on the numeric keypad to expand and collapse branches:
	
	- The asterisk (*) expands everything under the currently selected branch in
	  the left pane.
	
	- The plus sign (+) or RIGHT ARROW key expands one level of the branch.
	
	- The minus sign (-) or LEFT ARROW key collapses one level of the branch.
	
	NOTE: To use the LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys on the numeric keypad,
	make sure the NUM LOCK key is turned off.
	
	IMPORTANT: If you click a large branch, such as Categories, and then press
	the asterisk (*) key, it may take hours to expand that branch.
