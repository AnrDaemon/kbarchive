	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains a summary of major differences between working with slides
	in PowerPoint 4.0 and PowerPoint for Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Working with slides in PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0, is different in
	some ways than working with slides in PowerPoint version 4.0 for Windows.
	
	- Slide Sorter's maximum view scale is 100 percent in PowerPoint 7.0. In
	  PowerPoint 4.0, it is 400 percent.
	
	- In PowerPoint 7.0, any shape with text can be dragged and dropped onto any
	  empty text placeholder, and the placeholder will take on that shape.
	
	- When you apply a template in PowerPoint 7.0, the Notes and Handout Masters
	  are not affected. In PowerPoint 4.0, applying a template eliminates all the
	  previously existing formatting for the Notes and Handout Masters.
	
	- PowerPoint 7.0 has two Slide Masters; a Title Master, which controls all
	  slides that use the Title Slide AutoLayout, and a Slide Master, which
	  controls all other AutoLayouts. If the current slide uses the Title Slide
	  layout, and you SHIFT+Click the Slides View button, you will go to the Title
	  Master view. If you have not yet created a Title Master, you will go to the
	  Slide Master instead.
	
	- In PowerPoint 4.0, if you copy a slide while in Outline View and then click
	  Paste on the Edit menu while a slide is selected, the selected slide will be
	  replaced with the pasted slide. This has been changed in PowerPoint 7.0 so
	  that the new slide is pasted after the selected slide. This change is
	  intended to help prevent you from accidentally deleting slides you did not
	  intend to delete.
	
	- There is no Outline Master in PowerPoint 7.0. Its functionality has been
	  added to the Handout Master. If you click the Outline View button while
	  holding down the SHIFT key, you will go to the Handout Master.

	PowerPoint for Windows 95, see either of the following categories in PowerPoint
