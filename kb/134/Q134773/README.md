	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you drag a Paint file to a printer in the printers folder or on the
	desktop, the Printing dialog box appears, but the printer's name is not
	displayed. The dialog box contains a message similar to:
	
	  Printing <filename> on the <blank> on <blank> Page <x>
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Although the Printing dialog box does not show the information about the
	printer, the document is printed correctly. If you prefer to see the printer
	name appear in the dialog box, print the file directly from Paint.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
