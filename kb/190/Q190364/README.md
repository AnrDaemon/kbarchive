	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When clients connect to a Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW)
	volume, they cannot see all the files in very large directories (anything over
	approximately 16,000 files).
	
	RESOLUTION

	Currently, the only workaround is to reduce the number of files and directories
	to below 16,000.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
	Windows NT. We will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
	regarding this issue if it becomes available.
