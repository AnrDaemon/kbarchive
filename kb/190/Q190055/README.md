	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Baseball 3D, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	General Manager is a program included with Baseball 3D that you can use to
	modify team rosters and edit, create, and delete players in the season database
	for Baseball 3D.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use General Manager to modify a season database file, follow these steps:
	
	1. Quit Baseball 3D if it is running.
	
	2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Baseball
	  3D, and then click General Manager.
	
	3. Click Open.
	
	4. Click the season database file you want to modify, and then click Open. The
	  default season database file is the Currentseason.dat file.
	
	  NOTE: To modify the season database file during a season, click the current
	  season database file. For the best results, we recommend you modify the
	  season database file before you start a new season.
	
	5. Make any of the following changes you want in the Baseball 3D season database
	  file:
	
	   - Trade players
	   - Pick up free agents
	   - Release players
	   - Edit players
	   - Create players
	   - Modify default team lineups
	
	  NOTE: General Manager does not allow you to save changes in a season database
	  file unless all team rosters contain exactly 25 players.
	
	6. Click Save.
	
	7. In the File Name box, type a new file name for your season database, and then
	  click Save. The file name must use the following format
	
	  <name>season.dat
	
	  where <name> is any name you want to use.
	
	  NOTE: You should save the modified season database to a new file name. If you
	  save the changes to the Currentseason.dat file, General Manager overwrites
	  the default season database, and you must reinstall Baseball 3D to restore
	  the original default season database.
	
	8. Click Close.
	
	To use your modified season database in a new season or in a single game, follow
	these steps:
	
	1. On the Options menu, click Start New Season.
	
	2. When you are prompted to overwrite your current season, click Yes.
	
	3. In the league configuration dialog box, click the Left Arrow (<) or Right
	  Arrow (>) button to select the season database you want to use, and then
	  click OK.
	
	4. Click Single Game or Season to start a game that includes your database
	  changes.
