	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	Keyboard shortcuts, such as Alt+K which performs the Check Name function in the
	Outlook Client, are not supported in the Outlook Web Access Client.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. Most JavaScript-aware browsers may be used as Outlook Web
	Access Clients. Keyboard shortcuts are difficult to implement because they may
	conflict with an existing browser's keyboard shortcut.
