	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When running a setup program generated by the Visual Basic Package and
	Deployment Wizard (PDW), a "Locate File" error message is displayed.
	
	This typically occurs when navigating to a URL that invokes an Internet Component
	Download. For example, navigating to an ActiveX Document or Web page containing
	an ActiveX control packaged with the PDW.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The setup program may be unpacking a .CAB file that has another .CAB file inside
	of it, also known as a "nested" CAB file. The Internet Component Download INF
	syntax generated by the PDW does not support nested CAB files; therefore, an
	error message prompts the user for the location of the file.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
	beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the next service pack for
	Visual Studio 6.0.
