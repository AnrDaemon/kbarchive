	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Visual FoxPro 5.0 contained the ImagEdit utility. ImagEdit is not included with
	Visual FoxPro 6.0. This article discusses the tools that are available to edit
	images, such as icon (.ico) files, after you install Visual FoxPro 6.0.
	
	While you can edit an icon file using the HTML Help Image Editor, you cannot save
	the changes to an icon file using this tool.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the HTML Help Image Editor that is part of the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop.
	The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop is available from Microsoft as a free download
	from the following Web site:
	
	  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp
	  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp)
	
	After you download the file, execute it to install the HTML Help Workshop.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
