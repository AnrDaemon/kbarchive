	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you are using the Citrix ICA client with Terminal Server, you can select a
	callback number for dial-in clients either in Terminal Server Connection
	Configuration or in User Manager. If the administrator selects a fixed number
	for callback, however, the user interface allows you to close the dialog box
	even if you entered no phone number. When users dial in, they get a dialog that
	tells them to contact their system administrator, because the dial back number
	has not been set. While this situation is an annoyance, it poses no security
	risk. To fix the situation, turn off the callback feature or enter a phone
	number.
