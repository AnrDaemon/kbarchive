	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to find a restaurant using the Zagatsurvey Restaurant Guide in
	Expedia Trip Planner 98 or Expedia Streets 98, you may receive the following
	error message:
	
	  No Matching Places Were Found.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:
	
	- The search settings in the Zagatsurvey Restaurant Guide dialog box are too
	  restrictive.
	
	- One or more program files are missing or damaged.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, try a less restrictive search in the Zagatsurvey
	Restaurant Guide dialog box.
	
	If the issue continues to occur, manually copy the program files from the Trip
