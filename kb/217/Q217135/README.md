## Q217135: XWEB: Post Items in Public Folders Are Not Refreshed by Outlook

	Article: Q217135
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:5.5
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) to view public folders, any
	subsequent modification to an already opened "posted item" is not refreshed in
	OWA, until the user logs off and logs on again. The user continues to view the
	original content of the item.
	
	This happens only with "post items" and not with "sent items".
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
	this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
	phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

	NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
	be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
	update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
	
	The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
	later:
