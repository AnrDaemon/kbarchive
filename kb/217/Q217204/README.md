	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When an age limit is placed on a public folder that is a shared calendar, any
	reoccurring appointments are deleted when the age limit is reached. The age
	limit checks the creation date and handles the item as a single object.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To avoid the deletion of reoccurring appointments from a shared public folder,
	remove the age limit from the public folder.
