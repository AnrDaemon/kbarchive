	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Pages 455-456 of the Microsoft Press book Deploying Microsoft Exchange Server
	5.5 make reference to three .csv files that were to be found on the companion
	CD-ROM. These files were not included in the first two printings of the book.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Microsoft Press has created a self-extracting executable file that contains the
	missing .csv files.
	
	The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
	
	  Depxchg1.exe
	  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/exch55/mspress/2.0/WIN98/EN-US/Depxchg1.exe)

	Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
	posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
	servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.
