	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Setup program of the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition from
	Microsoft Press requires a 10-digit CD key. However, the CD key sticker on the
	back of your jewel case may contain an 11-digit CD key.
	
	NOTE: This applies to the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition
	only.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Initially, the wrong type of CD key stickers were used with this product.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	It is possible to use the 11-digit CD key that was included with the Visual
	Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition CD-ROM. To do this, you must remove the last
	digit from the first group of four numbers. In other words, if the CD key
	reads:
	
	  1234-5678907
	
	Remove the "4" and enter the CD key as follows:
	
	  123-5678907
	
	This allows the product to install correctly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
	Deluxe Learning Edition.
