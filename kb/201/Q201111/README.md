	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Exchconn.ini file located in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn directory
	contains the settings for the Microsoft Exchange Connectivity Controller as well
	as the Exchange Server connectors for Lotus Notes, SNADS, and/or OV/VM.
	
	Detailed help for this settings file can be found in the Linkini.hlp file also

	Microsoft recommends using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to
	configure the Notes, SNADS, and OV/VM connectors, instead of directly editing
	the Exchconn.ini file. Direct editing of this settings file may result in
	improper functionality of the connector.
