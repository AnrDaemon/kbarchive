	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses the steps necessary for you to insert a Java Applet into
	a HTML document in FrontPage Editor.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	On the Insert menu in FrontPage Editor, point to Other Components, and then
	click Java Applet.
	
	On the Insert menu, point to Advanced, and then click Java Applet.
	
	1. In the Applet Source box of the Java Applet Properties dialog box, type in
	  the name of the Java applet source file. Java applet source files usually
	  have a .class file name extension.
	
	  NOTE: You will need to import the Java applet class file(s) into your
	  FrontPage web.
	
	1. If the HTML document is in a different location than the Java Applet Class
	  file(s), you will need to type the URL of the folder that contains the Java
	  applet class file(s) into the Applet Base URL box.
	
	2. In the Message For Browsers Without Java Support box, you can type in a HTML
	  tag for Web browsers that do not support Java applets.
	
	3. For each parameter that you need to pass to the Java applet, click Add, and
	  type the parameter's name and the value needed in the Set Attribute Value
	  dialog box.
	
	4. Because there is no standard mechanism for displaying the valid properties
	  and values for a given applet, you will need to consult the documentation for
	  the Java applet and input the correct parameters and values.
	
	5. In the Layout section of the Java Applet Properties dialog box, you can
	  optionally specify alignment, width and height values, horizontal and
	  vertical spacing, and border thickness for the Java applet.
	
	6. Click OK to close the Java Applet Properties dialog box.
