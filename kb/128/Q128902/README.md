	========
	
	With Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, two overlapping group boxes become
	indistinguishable (hidden) from the background of the active window when the
	default display properties are used.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The group boxes will become visible if you change the appearance of the active
	window from the default. To change the display window's background color,
	perform the following steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, choose Window Properties.
	
	2. Choose the Format tab.
	
	3. Choose the Background button.
	
	The default display properties of Exchange Forms Designer is consistent with the
	functionality of Visual Basic.
