	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start one of the programs listed at the top of this article, you may
	receive the following error message:
	
	  Insufficient Resources. Please quit one or more applications, then restart
	  the program.
	
	Or, you may receive a similar error message that mentions either memory or
	resources.
	
	You may receive this error message if you are running Packard Bell Navigator on a
	Packard Bell computer with 4 megabytes (MB) of RAM.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, use the following steps to remove the Navigator icon
	from the StartUp group:
	
	Windows 95
	----------
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Taskbar.
	
	2. Click the Start Menu Programs tab, then click the Remove button.
	
	3. Click the plus sign to the left of the StartUp folder icon, which expands the
	  hierarchical tree so you can see the items in the StartUp folder.
	
	4. Click the Navigator icon, then click the Remove button.
	
	5. Click Close and then OK to exit the Taskbar Properties window.
	
	Windows 3.1
	-----------
	
	1. In Program Manager, open the StartUp group.
	
	2. Click the Navigator icon once and press the DELETE key, then click Yes.
	
	3. Exit Windows.
	
	4. At the MS-DOS prompt, type "win" (without the quotation marks).
	
	For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
	printed documentation or online Help.
	
	After following the steps above, you should be able to run the programs listed at
	the top of this article successfully.
	
	NOTE: After following the above instructions, each time you enter Windows, you
	will be in Program Manager, not Navigator. This is because Navigator is no
	longer in your StartUp group.
	
	If, after following these steps, you want to run Navigator, switch to the PB
	Tools group in Program Manager, and double-click the Navigator icon located
	there. Do not attempt to run Navigator at the same time that you are running
	Magic School Bus.
