	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to insert a Harvard Graphics version 2.0 for Windows slide into a
	WordPad document, you receive the following error message:
	
	  Hgw2exe
	
	  An error has occurred in your program. To keep working anyway, click Ignore
	  and save your work in a new file. To quit this program, click Close. You will
	  lose information you entered since your last save.
	
	When you click either the Close or the Ignore button, you receive the following
	error message:
	
	  This application has performed an illegal operation and will shut down. If
	  the problem persists contact the program vendor.
	
	Clicking the Close button stops the insert procedure.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This error occurs only if you try to insert a slide from Harvard Graphics into a
	WordPad document without first starting Harvard Graphics.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Start the Harvard Graphics 2.0 for Windows program before you try to insert a
	Harvard Graphics slide into a WordPad document.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Similar problems may occur when you try to insert a Harvard Graphics slide into
	a Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows document or Microsoft Excel version 5.0
	for Windows spreadsheet. Even with Harvard Graphics open, however, you cannot
	insert a Harvard Graphics slide directly into these applications. You must copy
	the slide onto the Windows 95 Clipboard and then paste it into Word or Microsoft
	Excel.
