	A Microsoft Exchange administrator can configure distribution lists so selected
	users can manage list membership using one of the Microsoft Exchange Windows

	or she must first have the appropriate permissions to that list.

	To grant the permissions needed by a user who will perform distribution list
	management, do the following:
	
	1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.
	
	2. Select the distribution list name in the Recipients container.
	
	3. Click the Modify button in the Owner section and select a user from the list
	  box to be an owner of this distribution list.
	
	Managing a Distribution List from a Windows Client or Outlook
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	To manage a distribution list (DL) from a Microsoft Exchange Windows client or
	Outlook:
	
	1. From the Tools menu, choose Address Book.
	
	2. From the Global Address List or the Recipients container for the site
	  containing the DL, select the DL to be modified.
	
	3. Bring up the properties for the DL, by double-clicking the selected item or
	  by choosing Properties from the File menu.
	
	4. Click the Modify Members button to bring up the members of the DL.
	
	5. If you have the correct permissions on the DL, you should be able to modify
