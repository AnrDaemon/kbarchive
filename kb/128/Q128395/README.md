	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When attempting to run programs or play videos from the internal CD-ROM drive on
	the IBM Thinkpad 755CD computer, you may receive general protection (GP) faults,
	Insufficient Memory error messages, or other random problems.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	IBM has an updated 755CD BIOS/configuration program that may correct the
	problem.

	problem reading from the CD-ROM drive. Data may become corrupt during the
	transfer to memory or to the hard disk.
	
	This IBM disk is available in the Thinkpad forum on CompuServe (GO THINKPAD). The
	filename is SYSTPE100.EXE and is listed as the TP755CD/CD/CSE System Program
	Disk.
