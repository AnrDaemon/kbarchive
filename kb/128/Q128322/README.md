	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Scenario 3 of the Microsoft Mail Technical Configuration Primer, located on the
	Microsoft TechNet CD, incorrectly states the following:
	
	  Upgrading the Windows for Workgroups Postoffice
	
	  To upgrade a Windows for Workgroups postoffice to a Mail 3.2 postoffice, run
	  the Extend program (EXTEND.EXE). The Extend program installs a new set of
	  executable files to run the enhanced administration and communication
	  features, and will update the Mail data files.
	
	In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions, the Extend program
	does not exist. The EXTEND.EXE program is now called SETUP.EXE.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Extend program should be used when upgrading a Windows for Workgroup
	postoffice to a version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice.
	
	Additional query words: 3.20 EXTEND.EXE
