	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When completing the Registration Information in the Microsoft Complete Baseball
	Daily, the City name must be longer than two characters, or you will receive the
	following error message:
	
	  The City is not filled out properly, please re-enter this data.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Workaround 1
	------------
	
	Do not abbreviate city names if they are longer than two characters. Spell out
	the City name completely.
	
	For example:
	
	  LA
	
	Should be:
	
	  Los Angeles
	
	Workaround 2
	------------
	
	If the City name is only two characters, use the SPACEBAR key to enter a space at
	the end of the City name.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Baseball 1995. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
