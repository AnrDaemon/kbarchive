	Placing a Control on a Single Page
	----------------------------------
	
	The page frame has to be active in order to place a control on a single page. To
	achieve this, once the page frame is on the form:
	
	1. Click the right mouse button on the page frame. The frame's shortcut menu is
	  displayed.
	
	2. Select Edit from the menu. A hatched wide border is drawn around the page
	  frame.
	
	3. Select the page you need to use, and drop a control on the page.
	
	The Edit option from the right mouse click will also allow you to activate other
	containers such as option groups and command button groups.
	
	Placing a Control On All Pages in a Page Frame
	----------------------------------------------
	
	Here are two methods you can use:
	
	- Cut and paste the object. Then follow the above procedure to drop the control
	  on every page.
	
	-or-
	
	- Place the control over the page frame. To do this, ensure that the page frame
	  does not have a wide border. Then drag the control onto the page frame. The
	  control is then contained in the form and not in a page of the page frame.
