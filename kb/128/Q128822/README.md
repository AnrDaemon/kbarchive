	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you change modem-specific settings in the Modem Properties dialog box in
	Microsoft Fax, the fax transport does not use the new settings. For example, the
	fax transport does not use a new Speaker Volume or Answer After <n> Rings
	setting.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs only with certain fax/modems. A list of these fax/modems is
	not currently available.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To make sure the new settings are used, restart the application that will use
	them. For example, restart Microsoft Exchange after you change modem-specific
	settings in Microsoft Fax.
