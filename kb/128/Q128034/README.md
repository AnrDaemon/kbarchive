	driver may be lost.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you install Windows 95, Setup automatically updates any printer driver for
	which there is a Windows 95 driver using a default configuration. If you need to
	use a driver designed for version 3.x, you will have to reinstall and
	reconfigure it after reinstalling Windows 95.
