	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	By default, when you sign in to MSN, The Microsoft Network, your e-mail messages
	are downloaded to your computer. After the messages are downloaded, they are
	deleted from the MSN mail server.
	
	You may not want to download all of your messages or you may want to leave copies
	of the messages on the MSN mail server. You can use Remote Mail to see the
	messages that are waiting before they are downloaded to your computer. You can
	then choose to download messages, download copies of messages, or delete
	messages.
