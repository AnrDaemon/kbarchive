	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Device Manager may show an Unknown Hardware class.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows 95 does not know what the hardware is.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Try to determine what the hardware is, then contact the hardware's manufacturer
	about obtaining a Windows 95 driver and .INF file for the device.
	
	You may be able to determine what the hardware is by a process of elimination.
	For example, try to identify all the devices on the system until only one is
	left. The last device is probably the unknown device.
