	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To place a set of objects on a form and have them equally spaced from each
	other, follow these steps:
	
	1. Using the mouse, select all the desired objects by:
	
	   - Lassoing all the desired objects at once by clicking and holding the left
	     mouse button, and then moving the mouse pointer around all the desired
	     objects.
	
	  -or-
	
	   - Clicking each object in turn as you hold down the SHIFT key.
	
	2. To place the selected objects vertically, choose Vertical Spacing from the
	  Format menu; then select the Make Equal option. To place the selected objects
	  horizontally, choose Horizontal Spacing from the Format menu; then select the
	  Make Equal option.
	
	  If, when selecting items to space vertically, you select objects from two
	  columns, the Format Equal Space option will space all selected items to a new
	  location, and unexpected results might occur.
