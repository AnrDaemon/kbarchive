	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a page in landscape orientation with a PostScript driver under
	Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51, the text is in the opposite corner of where the
	landscape text is when printing with a Windows NT PCL driver. This is not
	consistent with the Windows 95, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, or the Windows
	NT 3.1 PostScript drivers.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
	done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.
	
	STATUS
