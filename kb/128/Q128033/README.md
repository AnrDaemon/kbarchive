## Q128033: Unable to Read Text with a 16-color Video Driver

	Article: Q128033

	Version(s): 1.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If a 16-color video display driver is installed for the Microsoft Windows
	environment and you run the Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright, the start up portion
	appears as expected. The display clarity does not significantly change until you
	are in the Contents screen and select an option. Once an option is selected,
	text becomes extremely difficult to read.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Change the video display driver to a full 256-color (or better) display. For
	more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
	printed documentation or online Help.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Frank Lloyd Wright version 1.0.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
