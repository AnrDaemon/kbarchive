	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for the Apple Macintosh, version 1.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In version 1.0a of Schedule+ for Macintosh, the only appointments visible are
	those of users on the same local server. Any user that wishes to have
	appointments made viewable to users on other servers needs to do the following:
	
	1. From the Schedule+ menu, select Preferences.
	
	2. Select Complete Text (except Notes).
	
	By default, this is set to Appointment Boxes Only, which allows other users to
	only view Free/Busy Times. There is also an option under Preferences called
	Nothing, which allows the user to deny all other users the ability to view
	Free/Busy Times and Complete Text.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Only local users can view the complete text of an appointment. If Distribute my
	Appointment Boxes to Other Servers (default) is selected under Preferences,
	users on other AppleTalk Mail servers can only view Free/Busy Times, even though
	the user whose schedule they are trying to view has selected Complete Text in
	the ...local server: section described above.
	
	Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00a sched+ can't see
