	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you create the Daily Directory, if the path location to the BS95_DLY
	subdirectory exceeds 41 characters, the path location will be truncated during a
	download. For example, if Baseball is installed in a tiered directory, such as
	the following
	
	  C:\PROGRAMS\WINDOWS3\MM_MEDIA\BASEBALL\DOWNLOAD\BASE95\MA95_DLY
	
	the dialog after the first download will display the file path as:
	
	  C:\....MEDIA\BASEBALL\DOWNLOAD\BASEB95\MS95_DLY
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The path will only display the first 41 characters and then append and
	substitute an ellipse (...) to indicate that the path is too long to be
	displayed.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Baseball 1995. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
	as it becomes available.
