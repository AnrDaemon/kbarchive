	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Pan Chinese Edition, version 4 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Simplified Chinese characters display as garbled text in the Taiwan locale of
	Pan Chinese Windows NT Workstation when you use the MS PingYing input method to
	type the characters.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This occurs because the Taiwan locale cannot display GB or GBK coded Chinese
	characters (such as Simplified Chinese). The Taiwan locale only displays BIG5 or
	Unicode-based Chinese Characters.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
