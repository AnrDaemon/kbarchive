	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, versions 1.0, 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The customer asks: "What happens if the device is left unplugged for an extended
	period of time?"
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Customer leaves MSN Companion unplugged for an extended period of time.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	- Some customers need to unplug appliances for extended periods of time while
	  traveling. Customers who do this may need to be reminded of the following
	  non-critical issues when they return:
	
	- New e-mail received accumulates and remains in the inbox. If an inbox reaches
	  maximum capacity, new messages take precedence and older messages are
	  deleted.
	
	- While out of town, customers can check e-mail remotely by accessing Hotmail
	  through another terminal.
	
	- The device could go into an automatic upgrade after extended periods of
	  non-use. The upgrade with be either "mandatory" (one that customers will have
	  to complete before using MSN Companion again) or "non-mandatory" (one in
	  which customers can click "cancel" and then connect without upgrading).
