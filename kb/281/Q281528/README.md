	  Here, customers can select the radio option, and choose from a wide variety
	  of music to listen to.
	
	- Many sites on the Internet allow customers to listen to music or streaming
	  radio. Advise customers that they can only listen to audio or video files
	  that are in Windows Media Format.
	
	- If a customer is listening to music and does not touch the MSN Companion
	  keyboard in a 10 minute period, then the device will prompt for a desire to
	  remain online. If the customer does not select yes, MSN Companion disconnects
	  from the Internet.
