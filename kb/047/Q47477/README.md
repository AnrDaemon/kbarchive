	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail, you can use the "@" (at) sign (created by pressing SHIFT+2)
	in the Address Mail window to search for all users who have accounts on a
	particular server. To do this, type the at sign, followed by the name of the
	Mail server, in the Type Name box.
	
	For example, to list everyone on the server named "Marketing," type "@Marketing"
	(without the quotation marks) in the Type Name box, then click the Find Name
	button or Add button.
