	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail, when you open the Address Mail window from any Send screen
	(Note, Phone, Image, Inquire, or custom form), "All" is the default user
	directory. The All directory displays all account names and group names from all
	Mail servers on the network. The Local user directory displays only those users
	created on your specific server, but not groups created on your server.
	
	You cannot change the default user directory from "All" to "Local." Please note
	that in Mail version 3.0, the user directory defaults to the user directory last
	used in the Address Mail window.
	
	The Add As button "To" is the default recipient mode in the Address Mail window.
	"Cc" (carbon copy) and "Bcc" (blind carbon copy) cannot be set as the default
	recipient mode. Please note that this feature was NOT added in Mail version 3.0.
