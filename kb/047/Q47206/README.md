	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There are two ways to experience soaring in the sailplane, ridge soaring and
	thermal soaring.
	
	To experience ridge soaring in Flight Simulator, select the mode Sailplane: Ridge
	Soaring from the Mode Library. This flight mode releases you into the air
	currents that are rising along the coast of Marin Country, northwest of the
	Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
	
	To experience thermal soaring in Flight Simulator, select the mode Sailplane:
	Thermal Soaring from the Mode Library. You will be released in an area with an
	abundance of thermal activity; by flying over the dark colored areas of the
	ground, you will likely fly into a thermal. When you do, the nose of the
	sailplane pitches up slightly, and then the VSI and altimeter indicate that you
	are climbing.
