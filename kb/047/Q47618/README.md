	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you select the Simple User List option in the Microsoft Mail Preferences
	dialog box, the Address button will not appear on the Send screens of the forms
	installed on the server you are connected to.
	
	The Simple User List option allows for a display of addressable user names to
	appear in the message window by default. You can select recipients for the
	message by clicking the name. Once selected for delivery, the name will have a
	check-mark next to it.
	
	Simple User Lists work most effectively in an environment with a small number of
	users. A large user list will confuse the interface and make it difficult to
	address mail messages.
	
	It is not possible to have access to both the Simple User List and the Address
	button from a Send screen.
