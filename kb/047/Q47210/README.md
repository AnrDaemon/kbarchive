	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Aspect Ratio is the ratio between the plane's span and the mean chord of its
	wings. It is calculated by using the following formula:
	
	  Aspect Ratio = Span/Mean Chord
	
	Chord is the distance from the leading edge (front of the wing) to the trailing
	edge (rear of the wing). Many plane wings taper (i.e., have greater distance
	from the front to the back near the fuselage, than narrow-width at the
	wingtips); thus, an average distance is computed (the "mean chord").
