## Q47450: Chart Location for Scaletitle Documented Incorrectly

{% raw %}

	In the Presentation Graphics chapter of "C for Yourself," there is an
	error on Page 256. Under the scaletitle heading, the second paragraph
	states that "the x axis scaletitle appears below the x axis title."
	This is not correct. If an x axis scaletitle is displayed, it always
	will be ABOVE the x axis title. The positioning of the y axis
	scaletitle is described correctly.
