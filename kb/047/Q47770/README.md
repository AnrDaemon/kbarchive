## Q47770: Possible Explanation for &quot;Cannot Close This Window&quot; Error

{% raw %}

	Article: Q47770
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 1.00   | 1.00
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS | OS/2
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 26-SEP-1989
	
	Problem:
	
	Under M Version 1.00 I have two horizontal windows open, each viewing
	separate files. When I attempt to close a window (META+WINDOW or F9+F6),
	I sometimes get the error message "Cannot close this window." Under
	seemingly similar conditions, this error message does not occur and
	the window closes properly.
	
	Response:
	
	This message occurs when you attempt to close a window that contains
	modified text. If you want to abandon edits on the file, you can
	reread the file using SHIFT+F7 and then successfully close the window.
