	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Mail version 3.0 allows you to send one or more files with your
	message. When you attach files to a message, Mail copies them from your disk and
	sends them on with the message. On receiving the message, the recipient can save
	the enclosed files and then load them into the appropriate applications to work
	with them.
	
	Previous versions of Microsoft Mail did not support multiple file enclosures.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you have a file enclosed with a Mail version 1.3x or 2.0 message and you try
	to enclose another file, the new file replaces the previous file as the enclosed
	file.
	
	Additional query words: 1.35 1.36 1.37 2.00
