## Q47725: QuickC: Tilde Erroneously Replaced by Minus Sign in Help

	Article: Q47725
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 2.00 2.01
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | s_quickc docerr | mspl13_c
	Last Modified: 10-OCT-1989
	
	In the operator precedence table in the on-line help in QuickC Version
	2.00 and QuickC with Quick Assembler Version 2.01, the character
	displayed as the one's complement operator is the minus sign (-). This
	erroneous character should be the tilde (~).
	
	To view the erroneous character, call up QuickC, bring up the help
	menu, go into the contents section, and select operator precedence
	under the "Useful Tables" heading. The minus sign is located in the
	second section above the correctly represented minus sign.
