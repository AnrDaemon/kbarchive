	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Network license agreements do not exist for any Microsoft language products.
	These agreements are currently available only for our application products.
	
	According to the licensing agreement printed on the envelope that contains the
	disks, our languages are licensed as single-user, single-workstation products
	and cannot be used by more than one user simultaneously. The agreement does
	allow users to share the software if they run it off the same workstation at
	different times.
	
	Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ may be placed on a network
	drive and shared by multiple users. However, the number of users who access the
	network copy must never exceed the number of copies licensed by the owner of the
	network.
