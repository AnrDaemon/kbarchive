## Q313701: Logon Manager Does Not Appear When Outlook Express is Launched A

	Article: Q313701
	Product(s): The Microsoft Network
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network Version 5.6 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Logon Manager does not appear when Outlook Express is launched after MSN 5.6
	automatic upgrade.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	After an automatic upgrade to MSN version 5.6, Outlook Express will not launch
	Logon Manager--whether you start Outlook Express from the desktop or from the
	Program Files menu. Instead, a prompt appears asking what connection you would
	like to dial with. The only option is Don't dial a connection. This is a known
	issue.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If Outlook Express has not been configured correctly before the forced upgrade
	to MSN 5.6, then Logon Manager will not launch when you start Outlook Express.
