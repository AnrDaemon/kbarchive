	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to start the Researcher in Microsoft Encarta Reference Library
	2002, you may receive an error message similar to the following:
	
	  The page cannot be displayed.
	
	  There is a problem with the page you are trying to reach and it cannot be
	  displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur if Encarta Reference Library is damaged.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, follow these steps.
	
	NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
	different on your computer. If they are, please consult your product
	documentation to complete these steps.
	
	1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Click "Add or Remove Programs".
	
	3. In the list of currently installed programs, click "Microsoft Encarta
	  Reference Library 2002", and then click Remove.
	
	4. Start Windows Explorer, and then browse to the folder where Encarta is
	  installed (for example, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Encarta).
	
	5. Delete the Microsoft Encarta folder and the FactFinder folder.
	
	6. Use a clean boot to restart your computer.
	
	  NOTE: A clean boot is a way to create a clean environment. When you start your
	  computer with a clean boot, Microsoft Windows starts and loads only basic
	  devices and services. For information about how to use a clean boot and how
	  to use a normal startup, see the "More Information" section later in this
	  article.
	
	7. Reinstall Encarta Reference Library.
	
	8. Use a normal startup to restart Windows.
