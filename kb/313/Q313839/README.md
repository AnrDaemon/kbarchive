	=======
	
	Previously applied "Quick Fix Engineering" (QFE) fixes may be overwritten.
	Several fixes (QFEs) have been issued for SP3 that are not contained in SP4. If
	you have installed any of these SP3 fixes and apply SMS 2.0 SP4, your
	installation will revert back to its original functionality and you must apply
	an update to your installation of SP4. These updates are now available from PSS.
	For a list of SP3 fixes not included in SP4, but available for SP4, see the
