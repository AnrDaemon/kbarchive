	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Outlook client for the Macintosh to open a PowerPoint
	attachment created using Microsoft Office 98 for the Macintosh, the file will
	not open and you receive the following error message:
	
	  The document <filename> could not be opened, because the application
	  program that created it could not be found. Could not find a
	  translation extension with appropriate translators.
	
	Also, the icon of the attachment is a generic file icon rather than the normal
	PowerPoint presentation icon.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Microsoft Office 98 for the Macintosh introduced a new file type for PowerPoint
	98 that was not previously mapped by the Outlook Macintosh clients.
