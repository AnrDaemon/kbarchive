	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, using a Dial-Up Networking
	connection or a third-party Internet service provider, you may receive the
	following error message when you attempt to send or receive e-mail on MSN or
	gain access to proprietary MSN content:
	
	  Modem is busy or cannot be found.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if your MSN connection settings are incorrect or the MSN
	Dial-Up Networking connections are damaged.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
	
	1. Right-click the MSN icon on the desktop, and then click Connection Settings.
	
	2. Click the "Connect using another dial-up Internet access provider" option,
	  and then click OK.
	
	NOTE: After you change this setting, you must connect to your third-party
	Internet service provider before you connect to MSN. When the "Connect using
	another dial-up Internet access provider" setting is enabled, you cannot use
	your modem to connect directly to MSN.
