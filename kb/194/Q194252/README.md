	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a Word 97 document that contains a large table with borders
	and/or shading to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 printer, the document may
	print very slowly.
	
	Changing the printer driver settings does not correct the problem; in fact, this
	may make the delay even more noticeable.
	
	This problem has also been reported on the Okidata OL-400, Okidata OL-830, NEC
	Pinwriter 6300, NEC 6300, Panasonic KXP 4420, and Epson LQ 2550.
	
	This problem does not occur when printing to an HP LaserJet IIIsi or 4si.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use the HP LaserJet IIIsi or 4si printer driver.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
