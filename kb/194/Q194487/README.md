	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Two file formats with similar abbreviations (RFT and RTF) are commonly
	confused.
	
	The difference between these two formats is as follows:
	
	- RFT-DCA (commonly referred to as RFT) represents IBM Corporation's
	  Revisable-Form Text Document Content Architecture format. This format was
	  developed by IBM for transfer of documents between its word- processing
	  systems and other systems.
	
	- RTF represents Microsoft Corporation's Rich Text Format. The Rich Text Format
	  standard is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for easy
	  transfer between MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2, and Apple Macintosh applications.
