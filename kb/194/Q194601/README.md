	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Word 97, when you open a WordPerfect 5.x for MS-DOS or Windows document that
	contains a table with borders, the bottom cell border for the last row on each
	page of a multipage table does not appear in page layout view and is not
	printed.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	After conversion, reapply the border to the cells at the bottom of the page. To
	do this, either select the affected cell or the entire table, click Borders And
	Shading on the Format menu, and reapply the appropriate border.
