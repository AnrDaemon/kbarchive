	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Encarta Virtual Globe 99 uses a vector printing method that is able to print
	extremely detailed maps. This printing method also creates a very large
	temporary file on your hard disk. You must have enough free space on your hard
	disk to contain this temporary file as well as the Windows swap file.
	
	If you continue to experience problems when you attempt to print a map from
	Encarta Virtual Globe 99, reduce your printer or screen resolution, or change
	your printer driver Graphics Mode setting to Raster.
	
	For information about how to accomplish these tasks in Windows, please see the
	online Help included in Microsoft Windows or consult the printed documentation
	provided with your printer.
