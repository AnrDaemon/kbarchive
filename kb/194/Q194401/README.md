	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to publish a FrontPage Web to a server, files that are checked
	out are not published to the server.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	FrontPage Explorer does not publish files that are checked out to the
	destination server.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use FrontPage Explorer or the Visual Source Safe client to check in the files
	before you publish your FrontPage Web.
	
	NOTE: Use the Visual Source Safe Client if you have multiple files to check in.
	The FrontPage Explorer does not have batch check-in capability.
