	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Word currently does not convert files directly from WordPerfect
	versions 7.0 and 8.0. However, both WordPerfect 7.0 and 8.0 have alternative
	formats available so that you can save your file in a format that Word 97 can
	open. For example, WordPerfect 7.0 uses a default Save As format of WordPerfect
	6.0, which Microsoft Word can convert. WordPerfect 8.0 uses a default Save As
	format of WordPerfect 6/7/8; so a version of Microsoft Word capable of importing
	WordPerfect 6.x can also convert these files.

	Additional Issues You May Encounter When You Convert WordPerfect 7.0 Files
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The WordPerfect 6.x converter ships with Word 97 and is part of the Typical
	installation. To convert a WordPerfect 7.0 file into Word, open the file in
	WordPerfect, save it in the WordPerfect 6.0 format, and then close it. Open the
	file in Microsoft Word, by clicking Open on the File menu, selecting the file,
	and clicking Open.
	
	To convert a WordPerfect 8.0 file into Word, open the file in WordPerfect, save
	it in the WordPerfect 6/7/8 format, and then close it. Open the file in
	Microsoft Word, by clicking Open on the File menu, selecting the file, and
	clicking Open.
	
	If Word does not convert the file correctly, close the file without saving it.
	Then turn on the Confirm conversion at open option (on the Tools menu, click
	Options, and then click the General tab), and try to open the file again. If
	Text Only (*.txt) is selected in the Convert File dialog box, manually select
	the WordPerfect 6.x option and click OK. This should allow you to import the
	file.
	
	WordPerfect 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, and 8.0 all use the same format for their files, but
	WordPerfect 7.0 uses a different header if you save a document using the
	WordPerfect 7.0 Save As format option.
