## Q194322: T/R NIC May Fail Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL) Test

	Article: Q194322
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): WinNT:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400sp4fix
	Last Modified: 10-AUG-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	NDIS 4.0 token ring drivers that support PROMISCUOUS mode fail Windows Hardware
	Quality Lab (WHQL) certification tests.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Token Ring drivers that support the ReceivePackets paradigm reveal a problem
	with Ndis.sys. When a packet that uses "group addressing" (for example,
	broadcast) is received, and promiscuous mode is enabled on the adapter, NDIS
	fails to filter the packet causing invalid addresses to be reported to LLC.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
