	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the functionality of the Auto-Rudder feature in Combat
	Flight Simulator and in Combat Flight Simulator 2.
	
	Because the functionality of the Auto-Rudder feature in Combat Flight Simulator
	was improved after the Combat Flight Simulator Pilot's Manual went to press, the
	description of the Auto-Rudder feature on pages 30 and 33-34 in the Combat
	Flight Simulator Pilot's Manual is no longer accurate.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Auto-Rudder feature in Combat Flight Simulator and in Combat Flight
	Simulator 2 is designed to make your airplane easier to fly if your joystick
	does not have a rudder axis or rudder pedals. When the Auto-Rudder feature is
	enabled, it moves the rudder automatically when you move the ailerons.
	
	Combat Flight Simulator and Combat Flight Simulator 2 automatically detect if
	your joystick has a rudder axis or rudder pedals. If your joystick has a rudder
	axis or rudder pedals, the game disables the Auto-Rudder feature. If your
	joystick does not have a rudder axis or rudder pedals, the game enables the
	Auto-Rudder feature.
	
	Some air combat maneuvers may be easier to execute if you disable the Auto-Rudder
	feature. To enable or disable the Auto-Rudder feature:
	
	1. On the Combat Flight Simulator startup screen, click Settings.
	
	2. Under Controls, click to select or clear the Enable Auto-Rudder check box,
	  and then click OK.
