	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following are the known game-play issues in the Microsoft Bicycle Games
	programs listed at the beginning of this article:
	
	- The character image that represents you is not a computer opponent;
	  therefore, the character does not speak.
	
	- It is against the rules to speak during the Bridge game. Therefore, the
	  opponents do not talk during this game.
	
	- When you run Microsoft Windows XP, non-administrator users cannot save games
	  or profiles. If you are an administrator, you can grant a user the required
	  rights by following these steps:
	
	  1. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click "Users and Passwords".
	
	  2. Select the user to whom you want to grant additional rights, and then
	     click Properties.
	
	  3. Change the user to a Standard User, and then click Apply.
	
	- These games do not support the Windows XP Fast User Switching feature.
	
	- On a Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98-based computer, the scroll
	  wheel on a mouse device cannot be used to scroll the text in Help.
