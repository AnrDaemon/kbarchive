	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A site certificate is the digital equivalent of an identification card in the
	Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public key encryption system. The site certificate
	is sent along with an encrypted message to verify that the sending Web site is
	truly the Web site identifying itself in the transmission.
	
	For added security, you can configure MSN, The Microsoft Network, to use only
	site certificates issued by the site certificate providers that you specify.
	Consequently, you are able to view only Web sites that have site certificates
	issued by the specified site certificate providers.
