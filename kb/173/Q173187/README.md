	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	The Out of Office screen for Microsoft Outlook Web Access varies from the
	Microsoft Outlook client in that when using Outlook Web Access, the reply
	message is not in the same box in the dialog as the Out Of Office check box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Outlook client shows the Reply message for Out of Office
	templates in the same box as the Out Of Office check box. This was done to avoid
	confusion about the usage. Outlook Web Access does not yet have this
	functionality.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access,
	version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
