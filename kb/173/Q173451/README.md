	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When accessing Microsoft Exchange Server using Outlook Web Access (OWA), an
	attempt from an Anonymous user to access a Public Folder (PF) that it does not
	have permissions to will return the error:
	
	  Failed to get Inbox.
	
	The following error may also be returned:
	
	  You do not have permissions to view this folder.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This does not effect Microsoft Exchange Server functionality because the
	Anonymous user does not have access to the PF.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
	version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
