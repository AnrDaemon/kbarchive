	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you receive an e-mail message using your MSN account, the message is stored
	on MSN servers for a specific amount of time, depending on whether you have Post
	Office Protocol (POP3) e-mail or Web-based e-mail (HTTP).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you receive POP3 e-mail via your MSN Internet Access e-mail account, then
	when a POP3 e-mail message is sent to your e-mail address, the message is stored
	on the MSN server until one of the following conditions is met:
	
	- You log in to your MSN e-mail account. When you log in to your MSN e-mail
	  account, messages on the server are forwarded to and stored on your computer.
	
	- 30 days have passed since the e-mail message was received by the MSN server.
	  When an e-mail message has been stored on the server for over 30 days, the
	  message is deleted to free disk space and improve performance.
	
	Note: If you use MSN version 5.6 or earlier, you are using POP3 e-mail. If you
	receive your e-mail in MSN Explorer, your MSN Internet Access e-mail is
	Web-based.
	
	If you have Web-based e-mail, messages may be deleted by MSN from your account
	for the following reason:
	
	- You exceeded the size limit for your e-mail account. MSN Internet Access
	  subscribers have a 10 MB size limit for e-mail accounts.
	
	Note: MSN Explorer users who use Internet Service providers (ISPs) other than MSN
	Internet Access have a 2MB size limit for the e-mail accounts they access with
	MSN Explorer.
