	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you choose a large size as part of your Windows desktop scheme, such as
	High Contrast White (Extra Large), the graphic on the Select Browse Object
	button (located between the Next and Previous buttons on the vertical scrollbar)
	does not get larger.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word 97. The graphics on the toolbar
	buttons do not change size based on your Windows desktop scheme.
