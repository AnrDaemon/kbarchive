	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the setup program for the Supplemental Course Materials, you may
	receive the following error:
	
	  This setup program is not intended to be used with your version of Windows.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Supplemental Course Materials were compiled for use on the Intel x86
	platform only. They will not install successfully on other platforms.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	There is no resolution at this time.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The System Requirements on the back cover of the "Microsoft Windows NT Technical
	Support Training" box explicitly states that an Intel-based processor is
	required.
	
	Microsoft Press is investigating the possibility of providing versions of the
	Supplemental Course Material files compiled for other platforms. This article
	will be updated as new information becomes available.
