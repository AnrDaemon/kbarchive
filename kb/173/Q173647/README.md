	How to Find ADO Knowledge Base Articles
	---------------------------------------
	
	ADO is not a technology that ships with one particular product, and has been
	treated as a product in its own right. To find ADO articles in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base (KB) on the Web, connect to:
	
	  http://support.microsoft.com/support/a.asp?M=S
	
	and choose "ActiveX Data Objects" as the product and enter your specific search
	topic.
	
	You can also pick "All Microsoft Products" or use the MSDN or other non-Web-based
	Knowledge Base search mechanisms, and search for the keyword "kbado," which all
	ADO articles contain.
	
	ADO Resources/Points of Information
	-----------------------------------
	
	ADO originally shipped with the OLE-DB Software Development Kit (SDK), but now is
	part of Microsoft Data Access Components or MDAC. To learn more about it, please
	visit the Microsoft Universal Data Access Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/data/
	
	or the ADO-specific Web page at:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/data/ado/default.htm
