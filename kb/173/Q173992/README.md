	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Many applications that run under Windows 95 now come with their own uninstall
	program. This article explains how you can uninstall a Visual FoxPro application
	that was installed using the setup program created by the Visual FoxPro Setup
	Wizard.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The setup programs created by the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard have the option
	that allows you to uninstall applications created by Visual FoxPro.
	
	You can use any one of the following ways to uninstall a Visual FoxPro
	application:
	
	- After installing a Visual FoxPro application using the Setup Wizard, running
	  the same setup program again offers the options Add/Remove, ReInstall, or
	  Remove All. To uninstall the application, you can click the Remove All
	  option.
	
	-or-
	
	- Using the "/U" switch when running the Setup.exe program also uninstalls the
	  application. In Windows 95, you will need to issue the following command:
	
	        C:\VFPApp\SETUP.EXE /U
	
	Additionally, there are several other options available to the Visual FoxPro
	SETUP program as in the following:
	
	  /A            Administrator mode
	  /G filename   Generate logfile of installation activity
	  /Q[0|1|T]     Quiet install mode (0 shows exit, 1 hides exit, T hides
	                all display)
	  /QN[1|T]      Quiet install mode with reboot suppressed
	  /R            Reinstall the application
	  /U[A]         Uninstall the application but leave shared components
	                (/UA to remove all)
	  /X filename   Set Network Log Location for tracking install instances
	  /Y            Install without copying files
	
	A full list of the options can be generated by starting the Setup.exe from the
	Windows 95 command line with the "/" switch (the forward slash character) as in
	the following:
	
	  C:\VFPApp\SETUP.EXE / 
	
	The setup program options can be combined to get precisely the affect you need,
	such as the following:
	
	  C:\VFPApp\SETUP.EXE /QT /U   **Uninstall the application silently
