	broken, click Ignore in the "Check Links: Broken Link" dialog box.
	
	STATUS

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A redirected link is one that redirects you to a different Web page.
	
	The new Check Links feature in the Web Authoring Tools Update checks each
	hyperlink or linked image in a Word 97 Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document
	to verify that the target destination exists. For each broken hyperlink, Word
	prompts you to update the hyperlink.
