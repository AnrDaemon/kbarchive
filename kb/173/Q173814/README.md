	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use Word 97 as your e-mail editor and click a button on the Formatting
	toolbar, the Find and Replace dialog box may lose focus.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	When you are using Word as your e-mail editor and want to find or replace
	formatting in a mail message, you must use the Format menu in the Find and
	Replace dialog box, and not the buttons on the Formatting toolbar.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Normally in Word 97, you can click the buttons on the Formatting toolbar to set
	criteria for the Find and Replace dialog box. That is, you can click the Bold,
	Italic, Underline, or paragraph alignment buttons, or select something from the
	Style, Font, or Font Size lists to enter information under the Find What or
	Replace With criteria. However, this feature is not available if you use Word as
	the editor in an e-mail program, such as Microsoft Outlook.
