	password.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The requirements for a valid Member ID are:
	
	- The Member ID must be from 3 to 39 characters long.
	
	- The Member ID may be alphanumeric, and may contain any combination of
	  uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.
	
	- The Member ID can include hyphen (-) or underscore (_) characters, but cannot
	  contain spaces.
	
	- The Member ID must not contain offensive language, or be harassing.
	
	- The Member ID must not blatantly misrepresent MSN.
	
	The requirements for a valid password are:
	
	- The password must be from 8 to 16 characters long.
	
	- The password may be alphanumeric, and may contain any combination of
	  uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers.
	
	- The password can include hyphen (-) or underscore (_) characters, but cannot
	  contain spaces.
	
	- The password must not be the same as your Member ID.
	
	If you select a Member ID that is already in use, you are prompted for a
	different Member ID. Select your Member ID carefully, because after it is
	accepted, you are unable to change it. Your Member ID is also your e-mail
	address.
	
	Your password, in conjunction with your Member ID, is required to log on to MSN.
	It is important to keep your password secret to prevent others from using your
	account. You can make your password more secure by:
	
	- Using a combination of letters and numbers.
	
	- Not using names, addresses, birth dates, social security numbers, phone
	  numbers, or other things that someone could easily guess.
