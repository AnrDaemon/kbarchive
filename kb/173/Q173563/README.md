	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Bookshelf 98 requires the Arial and Symbol system fonts to display information
	properly. However, if these fonts are not installed on your computer when you
	install Bookshelf 98, Bookshelf does not install the fonts.
	
	NOTE: This problem has been resolved in Microsoft Bookshelf 99 and Microsoft
	Bookshelf 2000.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, reinstall Microsoft Windows to restore the missing system
	fonts. To do this:
	
	1. Insert the Windows CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down the
	  SHIFT key when you insert the Windows CD-ROM to prevent the Windows CD-ROM
	  from starting automatically.
	
	2. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK
	
	  <drive>:\setup
	
	  where <drive> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.
	
	4. Follow the instructions on the screen. If you are prompted to choose between
	  "Copy all Windows files again" or "Restore Windows files that are changed or
	  corrupted," click "Restore Windows files that are changed or corrupted."
	
	You can also manually extract the missing system font files directly from the
	Windows CD-ROM. For instructions about how to accomplish this task, please see
	the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
