	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After you upgrade from an earlier version to MSN, The Microsoft Network version
	2.0 or later, your Favorites Places links may be missing.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	MSN 2.0 and later places links to favorite locations in a different location
	than earlier versions of MSN. This new location maintains the links together
	with Microsoft Internet Explorer to provide easy access to your favorite
	locations from both Internet Explorer and MSN Program Viewer. This behavior is
	by design.
	
	Microsoft welcomes suggestions or comments about changes in functionality and
	product design. You can submit your suggestions by filling out the form at the
