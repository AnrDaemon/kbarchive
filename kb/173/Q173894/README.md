	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some error messages that are generated by the Japanese version of Microsoft
	Internet Chat Server (ICS) Administrator program may be displayed in English
	rather then Japanese. The following is the most commonly displayed error
	message:
	
	  Please enter an integer between 0 and 10000
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The error messages occur because of a limitation of the Microsoft Internet
	Information Server version 3.0 (IIS 3.0). The error string is contained in the
	Mfc42u.dll file, which is installed by the Japanese version of IIS 3.0. The file
	contains a few English strings in place of the Japanese strings. This problem
	has no adverse effect on the operation of the Microsoft Internet Chat Server,
	except that errors are displayed in a language other than what would normally be
	expected.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
	Server version 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
