	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to open the 14Lesson.mpp or 15Lesson.mpp practice files, the
	practice file may not load normally. Instead, you may see a window labeled
	"Import" with various options for importing the file into your current project
	file.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In order for all of the "Microsoft Project for Windows 95 Step by Step" files to
	fit on one floppy disk, 14Lesson.mpp and 15Lesson.mpp were compressed. These
	compressed files are not readable by Microsoft Project for Windows 95.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Run the Setup program to install these files to the hard disk. In addition to
	copying the practice files from the floppy disk to your hard disk, the Setup
	program automatically decompresses these two lessons.
	
	For setup instructions, please read pgs. xxiv-xxvi, "Installing the Step by Step
	Practice Files."
