	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	"Learn C Now" comes with three low density 5.25-inch disks. However, most newer
	computers do not have a 5.25-inch disk drive.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There is an offer located on the back of the last paper page for an optional
	3.5-inch disk fulfillment. As of September 2, 1997, this offer is still valid in
	the United States only.
	
	In order to send the 3.5-inch disks to you, Microsoft Press will need your name,
	address, and daytime phone number, along with a check or money order for $5.00
	to cover shipping and handling.
