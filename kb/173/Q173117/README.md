	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a new Microsoft Word 97 document and copy styles into the Word
	document from another template through the Style Gallery, you cannot undo that
	action by clicking the Undo button (or by clicking Undo on the Edit menu).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Style Gallery is used to copy styles from other templates to your document
	and does not change the template attached to your document. The Style Gallery
	also does not write the changes to the Undo stack; therefore, no changes can be
	undone when you click the Undo button or click Undo on the Edit menu.
