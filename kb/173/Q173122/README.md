	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Systems Management Server to Remote Control a Windows NT client
	computer, the system running the Systems Management Server Administrator utility
	may be unable to use the mouse or keyboard to control the remote Windows NT
	client computer.
	
	Mouse pointer and keyboard input will not have an effect on the client even
	though screen updates continue to occur. This problem usually occurs after a few
	minutes of normal remote control usage.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
	Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
