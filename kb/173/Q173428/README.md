	What Are Comments?
	------------------
	
	A comment is a note or an annotation that an author or reviewer adds to a
	document.
	
	The comment feature inserts a comment marker in hidden text format at the
	insertion point and displays a comments pane in which to enter comments. The
	comment marker contains your initials and a number, for example [INT1].
	
	You can also have Word highlight the comment markers in yellow, and have a
	ScreenTip appear containing the text and creator of the comment, when you rest
	the mouse pointer over the comment marker.
	
	Word 97 also includes a Reviewing toolbar that contains all the tools for working
	with comments. To display this toolbar, point to Toolbars on the View menu, and
	then click to select Reviewing.
