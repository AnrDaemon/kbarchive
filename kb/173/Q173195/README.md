	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	In Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, sometimes no insertion point shows when
	you click in any of the editable fields, for example, the To field or the
	message body.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a System/Hardware issue. Some older Macintosh computers have 512 KB of
	video memory or less, and the new applications and Operating System components
	use a large amount of video memory for displays above 640 x 480 pixels.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Change the monitor resolution to 640 x 480 pixels. This resolution may not work
	for all Macintosh client computers that are experiencing this problem but should
	correct most of them. Also make certain the computers are running the latest
	version of the Exchange Macintosh client.
