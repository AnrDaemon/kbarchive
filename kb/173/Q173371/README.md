	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you access Microsoft Exchange Server with Outlook Web Access (OWA), a space
	at the beginning of a subject line will not be displayed. For example, if you
	receive a message with the Subject " meeting", Outlook Web Access displays the
	Subject as "meeting". This occurs regardless of the number of spaces at the
	beginning of the subject line.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
