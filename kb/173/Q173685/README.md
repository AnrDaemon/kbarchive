	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Using DAO 3.5, a Visual Basic application can synchronize Jet databases over the
	Internet. The purpose of this article is to discuss other required components
	and to point to references not included in Visual Basic Help or Visual Basic
	Books Online.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to DAO 3.5 (discussed in the Visual Basic Help and Visual Basic
	Books Online), the Replication Manager and Internet Information (IIS) Server are
	also required to synchronize Jet databases over the Internet.
	
	The Replication Manager is a component that is only available with Microsoft
	Office 97, Developer's Edition. It must be configured along with IIS in order
	for Internet synchronization to occur.
	
	The references below contain complete information on configuring the Replication
	Manager and IIS for Internet synchronization and replication.
