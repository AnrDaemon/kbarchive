	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start playing a Return of Arcade game, the joystick does not function
	properly. When you attempt to calibrate the joystick you receive the following
	error message.
	
	  The joystick is not responding. Either the joystick is unplugged or there is
	  no joystick driver installed. Please correct your settings and try again.

	To ensure the sound card is functioning properly, contact the manufacturer of
	the card or downloaded and install the latest sound card drivers from the

	install the latest drivers, to ensure that it is working correctly.
	
	The SideWinder drivers are available at:
