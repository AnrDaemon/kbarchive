	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A network administrator may want to audit or track the actions of remote access
	service (RAS) clients by IP address. Windows NT does not supply this feature.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Event Viewer displays only the basic information when a RAS client connects,
	such as username, connected port, length of time connected, and so on. To audit
	your RAS clients' activity, you will need to use a third- party product. Some
	products of this type include Remote Access Manager from Virtual Motion and RAS
	Manager from NTP Software.
	
	
	The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
	of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
	products' performance or reliability.
