	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	The Security Permission role of Search is not maintained on a specific container
	after the Apply button is selected in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
	program. The role is displayed as Custom, as is the Role column of the 'Windows
	NT accounts with Permissions' field. You might expect that the Role displays
	Search in both cases.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The correct rights are maintained in the Rights checkboxes so the functionality
	is not affected.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
	versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
