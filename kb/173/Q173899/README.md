	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	When you install Microsoft Exchange Server with the Outlook Web Access (OWA)
	component, Setup will by default point OWA to the local computer. But, if you
	are running custom setup and installing OWA alone, Setup prompts you for a
	server name to point to. If you choose later to install Exchange Server on this
	computer, Setup will not change the Server that was selected in the previous
	step. As a result, when you run OWA it will not point to the local Exchange
	Server computer. This behavior is by product design.
