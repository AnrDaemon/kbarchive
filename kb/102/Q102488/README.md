	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Norton Utility's Directory Assistance II version 2.0 on a Macintosh
	with a 9-inch screen (Mac Plus, SE, SE/30, Classic, and Classic II) and you
	choose the enclosure button, two errors occur.
	
	The following Directory Assistance error occurs and the Directory Assistance icon
	appears with an X through it, to the left of the text:
	
	  Dialog box too large
	
	This error vanishes after a short time, then the following alert from Microsoft
	Mail for AppleTalk Networks appears:
	
	  Sorry, there is not enough memory to complete the operation
	
	If you are running System 6.x and you click OK, you will return to the Note
	screen. If you are running System 7, either you will return to the Note screen
	or the Enclosure dialog box will appear.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you are running System 6.x, remove Directory Assistance II from the System
	Folder and restart (reboot) the computer. If you are running System 7.0 or 7.1,
	remove the Init from the Extensions Folder (located in the System Folder) and
	reboot the computer.
