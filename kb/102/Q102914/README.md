	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Mouse Driver for Windows, version 9.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Screen Wrap option provided with the Microsoft Mouse driver version 9.0
	disables the Quick Start feature of Microsoft Scenes. When you place the mouse
	pointer in the "Hot Corner" to activate the screen saver, no action occurs.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Quick Start feature looks for the mouse to be in the corner of the screen.
	If you are using the Screen Wrap option, there is no physical corner of the
	screen.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, disable the Screen Wrap feature.
