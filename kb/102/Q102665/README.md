	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you save a message to a file, Microsoft Mail for Windows does not determine
	if there is enough disk space before it starts writing the file. If the file
	already exists, Mail overwrites it. If there is not enough disk space, Mail
	truncates the file and displays this alert:
	
	  There was an unknown disk error. Some data was written disk.
	
	NOTE: This message should say "written to disk."
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
