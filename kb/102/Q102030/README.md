	Item ID   Filename       Description
	-------   --------       -----------
	
	S14212    VB3.EXE        The VB3.EXE and VBDIST.EXE files contain the
	S14213    VBDIST.EXE     source code for the article named "Harnessing the
	                        Database Access and OLE Support Capabilities of
	                        Visual Basic 3.0," by Joshua Trupin.
	
	                        Visual Basic version 3.0 ships with the Microsoft
	                        Access 1.1 Engine fully integrated into the
	                        language plus full OLE 2.0 container function-
	                        ality. It will allow developers adding data access
	                        and OLE 2.0 support to their apps to slice weeks
	                        off their development cycle.
	
	S14210    BEASTIES.EXE   The BEASTIES.EXE file contains the source code for
	                        the article named "Slay the Porting Beasties:
	                        Dave's Top Ten Tips for Migrating to Windows NT,"
	                        by Dave Edson.
	
	                        Porting your 16-bit Windows-based applications to
	                        Windows NT is relatively easy, once you get advice
	                        from a veteran who knows where the evil lurks.
	                        Dave Edson shares some less-than-obvious porting
	                        tips he had to figure out the hard way.
	
	S14211    OLE2.EXE       The OLE2.EXE file contains the source code for the
	                        article named "OLE 2.0, Part II: Implementing a
	                        Simple Windows Object Using Either C or C++,"
	                        by Kraig Brockschmidt.
	
	                        OLE 2.0 and its object model don't solve every-
	                        thing, but they should make it easier for you to
	                        express object-oriented ideas under Windows. Here,
	                        Kraig Brockschmidt discusses various types of
	                        Windows Objects, how to get a pointer to one, and
	                        the interfaces they support.
