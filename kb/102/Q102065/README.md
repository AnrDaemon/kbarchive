	Although the error message NET3100 indicates that a "software error
	occurred," it almost always actually indicates a physical net
	problem. If you receive it only once or twice, it could mean that
	someone unplugged a cable and then plugged it back in. If you
	receive it several times, check concentrator cards, hubs, medium
	attachment units (modems) cables and net cards.
