## Q102303: Lost Apple Printer Connection Due to Outdated Mac Services

	Article: Q102303
	Product(s): Microsoft LAN Manager
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 30-JUL-2001
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A customer reported losing connection with Apple printers such as the
	Laserwriter II NT printer. The network was connected to Ethernet through an
	ETHERLINK box (which converts LOCALTALK to ETHERTALK) and used servers loaded
	with LM QUEUES.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This can be due to Mac Services being out of date or missing.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Make sure you are running Mac Services 1.0a--check the dates on files in
	C:\LANMAN\MACINTOSH 1/14/93. If you are not running the most current version,
	load it and try capturing the Apple printer again.
