	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks are not compatible
	with System 6 and DateBook Pro 2.0.
	
	The DateBook Pro README file states, "Microsoft Mail--Does not work with DateBook
	Pro. Contact Microsoft for an update."
	
	There is no specific update to address any incompatibilities with DateBook Pro.
	The README refers to the upgrade incorrectly. Upgrading the System software to
	System version 7.0 or later allows both products to operate correctly.
