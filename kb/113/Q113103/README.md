	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may find that when animation sequences reach the last frame, they reset to
	the beginning before you have had an opportunity to read the final screen.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Bookshelf listed
	at the top of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, progress through the animation manually, using the slide
	controller.
	
	NOTE: This problem does not occur in Windows 95.
