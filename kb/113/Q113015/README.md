	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you apply a template to an existing presentation file, the settings in the
	Slide Setup dialog box for the presentation are not altered. For example, if the
	template has a portrait orientation for its slides and you apply that template
	to a presentation whose slides have a landscape orientation, the orientation is
	not changed.
	
	All of the other Slide Setup options remain unchanged as well:
	
	  Slides Sized For
	  Width
	  Height
	  Number Slide From
	  Orientation
	
	The Apply Template (version 3.0) and Presentation Template (version 4.0) commands
	are designed to transfer the contents and formatting of the masters from one
	presentation to another presentation.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you want to change an entire presentation based on an existing file's
	template (masters) and Slide Setup, do one of the following:
	
	- Either apply the template and then change the Slide Setup of the presentation
	  to match the Slide Setup of the file used as a Template.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Copy all of the slides from the presentation to a new presentation that has
	  the same master and Slide Setup as the template.
