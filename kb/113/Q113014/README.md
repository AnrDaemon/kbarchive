	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	QuickShelf in Bookshelf 1994 or QuicKeys in Bookshelf 1993 may miss some
	keystrokes. For example, when you use a QuicKey combination to look up a item,
	you may need to type the key combination twice before Bookshelf gets activated.
	It may also take more than one attempt to restore QuickShelf or QuicKeys with a
	quick key combination if you have minimized it.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf 1993 and 1994
	editions. This problem was corrected in the 16-bit version of Bookshelf, 1995
	edition.
	
	NOTE: Microsoft Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95 (32-bit) does not use QuicKey
	combinations; this problem does not apply.
