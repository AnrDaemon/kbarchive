	with the search word highlighted in the title and text. If you then close the
	Find window (on the Tabbed List) the highlights in the found topic will

	Steps to Reproduce Situation
	----------------------------
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Find. Type a word, then click the Find button.
	  Bookshelf will display the first article found in which the search word
	  appears to the right of the Find window. The search word is highlighted where
	  ever it appears in the article.
	
	2. Close the Find window by clicking the little button in the upper-right corner
	  of the Tabbed List. The List disappears, and so do the highlights.
	
	  In Bookshelf 96, click the Contents tab to close the Find window.
	
	3. Reopen the Tabbed List by clicking the Find tab at the left side of the
	  Bookshelf window. The Tabbed List reappears, with the Find window up, and the
	  highlights reappear as well.
