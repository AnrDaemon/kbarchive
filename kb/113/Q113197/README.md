	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In level 104 of Chips Challenge, "The Jailer", Chip is surrounded by four
	colored keys. Once Chip is moved, pink balls start rolling across the screen. If
	Chip is moved onto a square that displays a key, and a pink ball moves onto the
	same square at the same time, an application error will occur followed by a
	general protection (GP) fault. Once the error message occurs, the Chip's
	Challenge game closes.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Avoid moving Chip onto a square that displays a key if, at the same time, a pink
	ball moves onto that square.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Entertainment Pack volume
	4.
