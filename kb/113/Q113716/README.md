	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet Plus printer driver version 2.15 supplied with
	U.S. Service Pack 2 for Windows NT does not provide support for font cartridges.
	The maximum font cartridges option is displayed as zero.
	
	CAUSE

	This problem occurs because regression in the driver disables support for font
	cartridges.
	
	WORKAROUND

	To work around this problem, use the HP DeskJet Plus printer driver version 2.14
	that was supplied with the original build of Microsoft Windows NT.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in U.S. Service Pack 2 for Windows
	NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem
	and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
