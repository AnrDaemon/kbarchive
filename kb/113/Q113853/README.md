	The Day/Night Variation Range option has no effect.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	According to page 90 of the Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook, the
	Day/Night Variation Range option in the World, Weather, Temp menu should add a
	realistic variance between daytime and evening temperatures.
	
	However, no variance in temperature actually occurs, regardless of the value in
	Day/Night Variation Range.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 5.0 for
	MS-DOS.This problem was corrected in Flight Simulator version 5.0a.
