	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you choose Address Book from the Mail menu, then select the Name Finder
	option (by pressing CTRL+F or by selecting the Search icon), the following error
	message may be displayed:
	
	  The partial name is not specific enough. Please be more specific.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	There are more than 500 names in the Address List that satisfy the specified
	criterion.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The Name finder has a limit of 500 names. The search criteria should be made
	more specific so the search returns fewer than 500 names.
	
	
	Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20
