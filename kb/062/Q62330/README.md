	- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
	- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The functionality of the mouse buttons in the Programmer's WorkBench
	(PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1 cannot be reversed.
	
	Although the functionality of the mouse buttons can be changed with MS
	OS/2 and MS-DOS, the change will be overridden by the PWB environment.
	
	This capability exists in PWB 2.0.
