	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can view the Recorder macro events that have been stored in a Recorder macro
	file by following these steps:
	
	1. Run Recorder.
	
	2. Open the file with the macro you want to view.
	
	3. Select from the list the specific macro you desire to see if multiple macros
	  are on that file.
	
	4. While pressing SHIFT, choose Properties from the Macro menu. This action
	  brings up a dialog box that shows all the steps that have been recorded into
	  your macro.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You cannot use this procedure to edit the macro, but it does allow you to view
	the steps that are performed when the macro is run. You cannot record sequences
	or execute macros while you are running an MS-DOS-based application. To do any
	of the above, you must have Bridge Toolkit version 2.0.
	
	For additional information on Bridge Toolkit, contact Softbridge Microsystems.
