	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To change or adjust a program group (for example, Main) in Microsoft Windows
	Program Manager, the group must be minimized in Program Manager's screen as an
	icon and selected.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For instance, to delete an entire program group, minimize the group, then from
	the File menu choose Delete. If the group is not minimized, Program Manager
	assumes that you want to delete the active program item in the active group.
	
	The above method also works correctly for the chosen commands in the Properties
	option in the File menu.
	
	If, from the File menu, you choose Properties with the program group selected as
	described above, you can edit the name or group that is being used.
