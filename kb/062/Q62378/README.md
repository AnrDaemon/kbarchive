	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	With Magic Software's AutoSave version 1.01 enabled, if you are composing a
	Microsoft Mail message and your Macintosh receives a Mail message, or a desk
	accessory (DA), such as Pyro 4.0, becomes active, or applications are changed
	while in MultiFinder, AutoSave 1.01 may send the message automatically and
	unexpectedly through Mail.
	
	AutoSave 1.01 automatically generates a COMMAND+S to save documents created
	within applications that are included in the Control Panel Exclusive List for
	AutoSave. COMMAND+S is also the command to send mail in Microsoft Mail.
	
	Magic Software's AutoSave II can be configured to use a character other than "s"
	to save; however, the Exclusive List in the version of AutoSave (1.01) shipped
	with Microsoft Office does not include either Microsoft Mail or the DA Handler.
	This version of AutoSave, included with Microsoft Office (Microsoft CD-ROM
	version 1.01), is a disabled version that will not allow changes to be made to
	the Exclusive List other than to delete applications.
	
	To obtain a fully functional version of AutoSave (AutoSave II) in which the DA
	Handler and other applications can be added to the Exclusive List, call Magic
	Software at (402) 291-0670 or (800) 342-6243 from 10 AM to 6 PM PST.
