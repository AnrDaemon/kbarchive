	The user's guide states the following:
	
	  Windows 3.0 works with most personal computers on the market today. In the
	  Windows package, you received a Hardware Compatibility List of equipment that
	  passed Windows compatibility testing. Any hardware that is 100-percent
	  compatible with hardware on the list should work fine with Windows. If you
	  intend to use equipment that is not on this list, ask the equipment
	  manufacturer about any special software you might need before you can use it
	  with Windows 3.0.
