	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Mail does not come with a spelling checker; therefore, there isn't a
	way to check the spelling of words within a Microsoft Mail message.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
	release.
	
	To work around this limitation, copy the text from the body of the message to the
	Clipboard (or to the Scrapbook). Then paste the text in an application that
	checks spelling (for example, Microsoft Word or Microsoft Works). Once the
	spelling of the text is checked, copy and paste it back into the body of the
	Mail message.
	
	Another approach is to edit the message text in another application, check its
	spelling, then copy and paste it into the body of the Mail message.
	
	Please note that some third-party spelling checkers appear to work in conjunction
	with Microsoft Mail. For example, Thunder 7 version 1.0 from Baseline Publishing
	(formerly Thunder II from Electronic Arts) appears to work with Mail. (Note:
	This product is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no
	warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.)
	
	NOTE: Microsoft Mail cannot use dictionaries from other applications.
