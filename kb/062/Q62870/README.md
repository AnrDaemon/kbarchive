	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Attempting to start DayBook as an icon by pressing SHIFT while double-clicking
	the DayBook icon with the mouse does not place DayBook into icon form on the
	following machines:
	
	  Wyse 386 16 MHz model WY 3216-01
	  NCR 3786 Model 1102
	
	DayBook runs through the animation session and then hides itself behind the
	Microsoft Windows version 3.0 Program Manager.
	
	NOTE: This behavior does not occur on most machines.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	A possible workaround is to turn off the animation portion of DayBook. From the
	Daybook Map Screen, choose File and Turn Off Animation.
