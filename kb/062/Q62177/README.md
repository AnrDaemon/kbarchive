	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Paintbrush for Windows shows the current cursor position (in pixel
	coordinates) in the Cursor Position window (in the upper-right corner) if you
	choose Cursor Position from the View menu. If Paintbrush is then minimized and
	restored, the Cursor Position window is no longer displayed. If Paintbrush is
	closed, it does not save the Cursor Position window either.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You can work around the problem by rechoosing Cursor Position from the View
	menu.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows Paintbrush
	version 3.0. This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.
