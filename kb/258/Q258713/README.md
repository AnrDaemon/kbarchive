	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the troubleshooting shortcuts that are installed by
	Allegiance.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you install Allegiance, several troubleshooting shortcuts are installed in
	the Allegiance folder. The default location of the Allegiance folder is:
	
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Allegiance
	
	You can use these troubleshooting shortcuts to troubleshoot problems that you may
	encounter when you play the game.
	
	Run Allegiance in Safe Mode
	---------------------------
	
	Start Allegiance with this shortcut if you are unable to start Allegiance
	successfully, or if the program quits unexpectedly during play.
	
	When you play Allegiance in Safe mode, the game movie and sound are turned off,
	and the game runs in Software mode, which automatically turns off all high-end
	Heads-Up Display (HUD) graphics in the game.
	
	Run Allegiance in Software Mode
	-------------------------------
	
	Start Allegiance with this shortcut if any of the following conditions are true:
	
	- The video adapter installed in your computer does not support 3D
	  acceleration.
	
	- You are experiencing problems with your 3D accelerator.
	
	- Allegiance has quit unexpectedly, and you are attempting to isolate 3D
	  acceleration as the cause.
	
	NOTE: Software mode automatically turns off all high-end HUD graphics in the
	game.
	
	Run Allegiance in Window Mode
	-----------------------------
	
	Start Allegiance with this shortcut to play Allegiance in a window on the
	desktop. In Window mode, you can manage other programs that are open on the
	desktop.
	
	NOTE: To use Window mode, the video adapter installed in your computer must
	support Window mode. In addition, Window mode usually causes Allegiance to run
	slower than in full-screen mode.
	
	Run Allegiance with Checkfiles
	------------------------------
	
	Start Allegiance with this shortcut to auto-update Allegiance, a process that
	ensures that all of your Allegiance files are up-to-date when you connect to
	Zone.com.
	
	Only run Allegiance in this mode if for some reason you think that your game is
	not being correctly auto-updated, because Checkfiles mode increases the time it
	takes to navigate to the Games List.
	
	Run Allegiance with No Movies
	-----------------------------
	
	Start Allegiance with this shortcut to skip the introductory movie. This command
	is useful if you experience any problems running the movie.
	
	Run Allegiance with No Sound
	----------------------------
	
	Start Allegiance with this shortcut to play Allegiance without any sound. This
	command is useful if you experience problems running the game with your sound
	card enabled.
