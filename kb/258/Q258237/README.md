	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The date and time reported in ISA logs may appear to be off by several hours
	even though the system time, date, and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) offset are
	correctly configured.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	All logs generated by an ISA server list the date and time in GMT, not local
	time. This is different from Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
	versions 1.0 through 3.0, which log in local time. Also, note that the date
	format (YYYY-MM-DD) is universal and is not affected by regional settings
	(unlike IIS), which makes parsing for non-United States logs easier. This also
	means that daily log rollovers happen at midnight GMT, which could be late
	afternoon for most U.S. locations.
