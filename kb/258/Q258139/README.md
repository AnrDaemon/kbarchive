	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try and install Microsoft Outlook 97 from the CD-ROM that accompanies
	the Exchange Server Training Kit, it appears to install, but when you try to
	open Microsoft Outlook you will receive the following error message:
	
	  "This version of Outlook has Expired!"
	
	You can click OK, but Microsoft Outlook will not open.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The version of Outlook 97 that Microsoft Press has been authorized to distribute
	with this Training Kit is programmed to expire after the Microsoft Outlook 2000
	release date.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	There is an Outlook 2000 evaluation that can be ordered from the following
	location as part of the Exchange 2000 RC evaluation kit.
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/evaluation/trial/default.asp
	
	Please note that this new evaluation version will expire 120 days after
	installation or on January 1, 2001, whichever comes first.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
