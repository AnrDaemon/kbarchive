	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have McAfee WebScan installed on your computer, and you use Microsoft
	Plus! For Kids, Protect It! to restrict a family member's access to specific
	programs, you may find that everything is restricted. For example, programs you
	did not restrict are now restricted.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	McAfee WebScan conflicts with Microsoft Plus! For Kids, Protect It! When WebScan
	is installed on your computer; all programs will be restricted when you restrict
	a user, fully, partially, or not at all, in the "Limit Programs" Protect It!
	dialog.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only workaround for this problem is to uninstall McAfee WebScan. To
	uninstall WebScan, do the following:
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
	
	3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, select McAfee WebScan from the list of
	  programs, and then click the Add/Remove button.
	
	4. Remove McAfee WebScan.
	
	Protect It! will now run correctly and restrict restricting those programs that
	were designated to be restricted by the Protect It! administrator.
