	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Chameleon NFS 6.0.1 on Windows NT 4.0, any mapped drives to
	the NFS volumes will disappear from the File Open Dialog Box after you click
	Open from the File menu to view available drives. This occurs with 16- bit
	applications like Visual Basic 4.0 and Visual C++ 1.5.
	
	NOTE: This may also occur in other applications running on Windows NT as well as
	other 16-bit applications. This issue does not occur with Chameleon NFS 5.0.1 in
	Windows NT 4.0.
