## Q166067: WV: Can't Use CTRL+C in Word Viewer to Close Full Screen View

	Article: Q166067
	Product(s): Word 97 for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbui kbdta kbviewer word97
	Last Modified: 19-JUL-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000, if you switch to full screen view, the Full
	Screen toolbar appears with a "Close Full Screen" button. If you press CTRL+C
	(the keystroke for "Close Full Screen"), the screen is unchanged.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In order for the shortcut keystroke to work for the button, the Full Screen
	toolbar must have the focus. Going into full screen view does not put the focus
	on the full screen toolbar.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To quit full screen view, use one of the following methods:
	
	- Click the Full Screen toolbar. Now the keystroke of CTRL+C works for the
	  toolbar button.
	
	- Click the Close Full Screen button.
	
	- On the View menu, click Full Screen.
	
	- Press ESC on the keyboard.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
