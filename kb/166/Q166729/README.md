	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is a documentation error. The ESS1888 sound card should not be listed on
	the Windows NT 4.0 HCL. A driver for this device is not included on the Windows
	NT 4.0 CD-ROM. Drivers are included for other ESS sound cards, but those drivers
	do not work with the ESS1888 sound card. Windows NT 4.0 does not support the
	ESS1888 sound card and does not contain drivers for it.
