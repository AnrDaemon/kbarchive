	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you choose to have Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 as the default program for
	opening documents, clicking a hyperlink to a document opens the document in Word
	Viewer.
	
	Because Word Viewer does not have a Web toolbar, there is no way to navigate
	"back" to the source of the link. That is, there is no "back" button in Word
	Viewer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Microsoft Word Viewer 97-2000 does not support toolbars.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you are navigating from one document to another document by clicking
	hyperlinks inside Word Viewer, you can work around this problem by using the
	"most recently used file" list on the File menu to switch from the current
	document to the previous document. However, the "most recently used file" list
	only shows the four most recently opened documents.
