	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Plus! For Kids Protect It! allows you to place restrictions on family
	members using your computer. It will not, however, allow you to hide, delete, or
	otherwise restrict the main system icons, such as the Recycle Bin or My
	Computer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You may want to limit family members' access to the Recycle Bin. For example, so
	family members using your computer cannot perform an unauthorized delete. This
	is not a feature of Protect It!
	
	There is a Windows 95 Power Toy named TweakUI that will allow you to restrict
	access to the Recycle Bin. Microsoft does not support the Power Toys, so you
	should use TweakUI at your own risk. TweakUI is available for download at
	http://www.microsoft.com.
	
	NOTE: See TweakUI's online Help for consequences of performing certain actions
	(i.e., If you choose to hide the Network Neighborhood icon from the desktop, you
	will prevent connections to network shares via Universal Naming Conventions or
	UNCs).
