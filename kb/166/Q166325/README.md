	Article: Q166325

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The 16-bit editions of Visual Basic include a Help file, win31wh.hlp,
	documenting the Windows 3.1 API functions. A Help file for the 32-bit API
	functions is not shipped with Visual Basic. However, the MSDN/Visual Basic
	Starter Kit shipped on the Visual Basic CD-ROM contains information about the
	32-bit API functions. This article shows you how install the starter kit and how
	to access the 32-bit API function information.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Among the information stored in the MSDN/Visual Basic starter kit is the product
	documentation for the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) which contains
	information on both the Windows 3.1 and the Win32 API functions. Additionally,
	the starter kit contains search tools and options that work better than the
	Windows Help file system.
	
	To Install the MSDN/Visual Basic Starter Kit
	--------------------------------------------
	
	1. From the Visual Basic CD-ROM, start setup.exe. The Visual Basic 4.0 Master
	  Setup dialog box appears.
	
	2. Click the MSDN Starter Kit button and follow the instructions.
	
	The setup program creates the MSDN_VB Starter Kit program group with the
	MSDN_Visual Basic Starter Kit icon. Start the MSDN Viewer by clicking on this
	icon.
	
	When the MSDN Viewer starts, look under Product Documentation, then SDKs. The API
	functions for both Microsoft Win32 and Windows 3.1 API are documented in this
	section. You can use the Search Engine of the MSDN/VB Starter Kit viewer to
	locate a specific API function, any associated data types and return values
	quickly. To use the search engine, click on the Find button on the toolbar and
	enter any search keywords.
	
	For more information on The Microsoft Developer Network or to order the full
	version of MSDN, call (800) 759-5474 between the hours of 6:30am and 5:30pm
	Pacific Time.
