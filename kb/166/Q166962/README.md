	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use Microsoft Plus! For Kids, Desktop Themes, any user can select a
	desktop theme and screensaver. The desktop theme can vary from user to user, but
	the screensaver will remain the same for everyone (for example, the last
	screensaver specified will be the one in use).
	
	For additional information about the desktop and Microsoft Plus! For Kids, please

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If User A logs on to the computer and selects the Jungle screensaver, the Jungle
	screensaver will be enabled for all users that log on to that computer. If User
	A enables a password with the Jungle screensaver, the password will only be
	valid for that user (User A). The password feature will be disabled for all
	other users, unless the other users previously specified their own password.
	
	If User B was previously using the Treehouse screensaver with a password, User B
	will now have the Jungle screensaver with the same password originally specified
	for the Treehouse screensaver.
