	- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When you print a message that contains an embedded message, attachments in the
	embedded message are not printed. The text of the parent message is printed with
	the text from the embedded message, but the attachments in the embedded messages
	appear as icons. This behavior occurs even if you select the Print Attachments
	check box in the Microsoft Exchange Client printing options.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by product design.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem:
	
	- Open the embedded message and print the attachment from the opened message.
