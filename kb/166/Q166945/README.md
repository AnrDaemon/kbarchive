	ActiveLU Missing From BackOffice Resource Kit CD-ROM
	----------------------------------------------------
	
	The help file for SNA Server contains a topic for a utility called ActiveLU.
	However, this utility was not included on the "BackOffice Resource Kit, Part 2"
	CD-ROM.
	
	ActiveLU is currently planned for a future release of the BackOffice Resource
	Kit. Please disregard any references to ActiveLU in this release of the
	BackOffice Resource Kit.
	
	Microsoft Press will post any updates to this information in the BackOffice
	Resource Kit Knowledge Base article. This and other Microsoft Press Knowledge

	Part 1, Page 212: DMI45.DOC Not On CD
	-------------------------------------
	
	Page 212, Paragraph 1 states that the DMI45.doc (Desktop Management Interface
	Specification 4.5) can be found on the BackOffice Resource Kit CD. However, this
	file was not included with the CD-ROM.
	
	DMI45.doc can be found on the Microsoft BackOffice SDK CD.
