	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The print session property page did not allow for settings to override the font
	size.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This feature did not exist in the original release of SNA Server, version 3.0.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A new property page for the printer session was added to allow for three options
	regarding the font size.
	
	1. Use Font Size (text box for size)
	
	2. Scale Font Size to Fit Printable Page
	
	3. Use Font Size as Defined by Host Print Job
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
	problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
