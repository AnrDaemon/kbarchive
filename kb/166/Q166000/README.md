	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When attempting to use the option for landscape orientation with the
	Generic/Text Only Windows NT printer driver, you may receive blank output.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Generic/Text Only printer driver does not provide the functionality to print
	in landscape orientation. This is true even though the landscape orientation
	option is available within the Page Setup menu from the application that is
	generating the print job.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT versions
	3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
