	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to run or install one of the products listed above, you may
	receive the following error message:
	
	  Not enough room on drive.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The most likely cause of this error message is that you do not have sufficient
	hard disk space available.
	
	Another possible cause is that the compact disc is dirty.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To determine if you have sufficient space available on your hard disk, do the
	following:
	
	1. Check the system requirements for the product that you are attempting to
	  install.
	
	2. Determine the amount of hard disk space you have available using the
	  following steps:
	  a. Double-click your hard disk.
	
	  b. From the View menu, click By Icon.
	
	  c. In the upper right corner of the dialog box, there is a value for the
	     amount of hard disk space you have available (i.e., 150 MB).
	
	If you have enough space available on your hard disk, clean the compact disc.
	
	To verify that the compact disc is clean and free of scratches, inspect the
	silver side of the disc. To clean the disc, wipe it with a soft cloth in a
	straight line, starting from the center of the disc and working your way out to
	the edge. Light or fine scratches should not present disc problems.
