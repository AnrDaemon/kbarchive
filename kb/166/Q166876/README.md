	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to load the remote control agent on a computer running Windows 95
	with an STB Lightspeed 128 graphics card and STB drivers (without Vision 95,
	STB's graphics manager), the screen blacks out and the monitor goes into power
	save mode. You must restart the system to recover.
	
	With Vision 95 loaded, the failure occurs when you exit the remote control agent.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use the Tseng ET-4000 driver with the STB card.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
