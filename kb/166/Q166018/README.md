	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the Newsletter Wizard, it always creates an extra blank page at the
	end of your newsletter.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There is a next page section break at the end of the newsletter on page four.
	This section break preserves the formatting of the existing sections, especially
	the headers and footers, and should not be deleted.
	
	To Keep the Extra Blank Page from Being Printed
	-----------------------------------------------
	
	1. On the File menu, click Print.
	
	2. In the Page range area of the Print dialog box, click Pages, and then type
	  the page numbers you want to print (for example, 1-4).
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design. The extra blank page is created to provide you with
	space to add additional text to your newsletter.
