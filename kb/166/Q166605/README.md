	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you compose a reply in Outlook to an Internet mail message, the original
	message text, as well as comment lines embedded into original message text, gets
	marked with the greater than sign. That is, when you reply to an Internet mail
	message and embed your responses in the body of the reply text, all of the text
	gets prefixed with the greater than sign.
	
	For example:
	
	  > Hi Shannon,
	  > Did you win the ball game?
	  >
	  > [Shannon Boyd] Yes, by a landslide!
	
	This should be:
	
	  > Hi Shannon,
	  > Did you win the ball game?
	  >
	
	  [Shannon Boyd] Yes, by a landslide!
