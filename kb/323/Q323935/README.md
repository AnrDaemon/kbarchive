	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you switch the Microsoft Flight Simulator window to full-screen mode, a
	black border may appear to surround the screen. (To switch to full-screen mode,
	press ALT+ENTER.)
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue may occur if the screen resolution in Flight Simulator is set to a
	lower resolution than the screen resolution of your desktop.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, match the screen resolution in Flight Simulator to the
	screen resolution of your desktop. To do this, follow the steps in either of the
	following methods.
	
	Method 1: Change the Screen Resolution in Flight Simulator
	----------------------------------------------------------
	
	1. On the Options menu, point to Settings, and then click Display.
	
	  NOTE: If the Options menu is unavailable, press the ALT key to display the
	  menu bar.
	
	2. Click the Hardware tab, and then under Fullscreen Display Resolution, click
	  the resolution that matches the screen resolution of your desktop.
	
	If these steps do not resolve the issue, use the steps in the following section
	to set the screen resolution of your desktop to 800 x 600 and 16-bit color.
	
	Method 2: Determine and Change the Screen Resolution of Your Desktop
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
	steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
	documentation to complete these steps.
	
	1. Right-click the desktop, and then click Properties.
	
	2. Click the Settings tab, and then under Screen resolution, note the screen
	  resolution.
	
	3. To change the screen resolution, drag the slider, and then click Apply.
	
	4. When you are prompted to apply the settings, click OK.
	
	  Your screen turns black for a moment.
	
	5. After your screen resolution changes, you have 15 seconds to confirm the
	  change. Click Yes to confirm the change; click No or do nothing to revert to
	  your previous setting.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Depending on the type of video adapter and monitor that you have, you can run
	Flight Simulator 2002 at several different screen resolutions. The program is
	designed to run at a minimum resolution of 640 x 480. If your computer system
	can handle it, set the resolution to 1024 x 768, which is optimal. Remember,
	however, that as you increase the resolution to see more detail, performance may
	be reduced. Experiment with different resolutions to find the best combination
	of detail and performance for your needs.
	
	For more information about how to adjust the screen resolution on your computer,
	click Start, click Help, and then search for "resolution" (without the quotation
	marks).
