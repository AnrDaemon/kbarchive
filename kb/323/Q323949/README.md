	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Dungeon Siege, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you exit a multiplayer game in Microsoft Dungeon Siege, version 1.0, you do
	not have a choice to save the state of the world. After you exit the game, you
	cannot resume the game. However, your character and the items in your
	character's inventory are saved.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In a multiplayer game, you can save only your character and your character's
	inventory because those are the only things that are completely in your control.
	It is not possible to save the game itself. There is nothing wrong with your
	installation of Dungeon Siege, and you are doing nothing wrong.
