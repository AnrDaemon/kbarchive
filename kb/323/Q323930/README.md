	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To import an aircraft and aircraft gauges from Flight Simulator 2000 into Flight
	Simulator 2002, follow these steps.
	
	NOTE: Flight Simulator 2000 and Flight Simulator 2002 contain gauge files that
	have the same file names. Do not overwrite the existing Flight Simulator 2002
	gauge files with earlier versions of the gauge files.
	
	1. Start Windows Explorer.
	
	2. Locate and then open the Aircraft folder of the Flight Simulator 2000
	  installation. By default, the Aircraft folder is in the following location:
	
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2000\Aircraft
	
	3. Drag the aircraft files that you want to import to the Aircraft folder of the
	  Flight Simulator 2002 installation. By default, the Aircraft folder is in the
	  following location:
	
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Aircraft
	
	4. Locate and then open the Gauges folder of the Flight Simulator 2000
	  installation. By default, the Gauges folder is in the following location:
	
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2000\Gauges
	
	5. Drag the gauge files that you want to import to the Gauges folder of the
	  Flight Simulator 2002 installation. (For example, for the Concorde, drag the
	  Concorde.GAU file.) By default, the Gauges folder is in the following
	  location:
	
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Gauges
	
	  NOTE: When you drag the gauge files, click No if you are prompted to confirm
	  replacing the file.
