	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to migrate an existing Qwest dial-up subscriber who
	is running Mac OS X to set up MSN Internet Access Powered by Qwest for Macintosh
	computers with both Mac OS 9.2 and Mac OS X installed. MSN Internet Access
	software is designed to work with Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x only.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The minimum computer system requirements for MSN Internet Access are as
	follows:
	
	- PowerPC Macintosh computer (G3 or higher recommended)
	
	- 32 MB of RAM (64 MB or more recommended)
	
	- Mac OS 8.6 or later
	
	- 32 MB of available hard-disk space
	
	- CD-ROM drive
	
	- Ethernet port
	
	- Video resolution of 800 x 600 or higher running thousands of colors
	  (resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher recommended)
	
	- 28.8 Kbps or higher modem
	
	The MSN Internet Access Powered by Qwest software supports Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x only.
	The MSN Internet Access software will not install on a Macintosh computer that
	is running OS X. However, because new Macintosh computers come standard with
	both Mac OS 9.2 and OS X installed, MSN Broadband can be installed, provided the
	computer is running OS 9.2 when installing the MSN Broadband software.
	
	To install MSN Internet Access on a Macintosh computer running Mac OS 9.2
	
	Follow the installation instructions included in your Welcome to MSN guide.
	
	To use MSN Internet Access with a Macintosh computer running Mac OS X
	
	It is possible to configure your system to work with MSN Internet Access while
	running Mac OS X. However, because the MSN Internet Access software will not
	install on a Macintosh computer running Mac OS X, using MSN Internet Access with
	Mac OS requires manual configuration. In addition, setting up your modem and
	computer manually to use MSN Internet Access does not permit installation of the
	following applications included on the MSN Internet Access CD-ROM.
	
	- Internet Browser (IE) 5.1 for Macintosh
	
	- MSN Messenger 2.1 for Macintosh
	
	- Outlook Express 5.0.4 for Macintosh
	
	For these reasons, using MSN Internet Access with Mac OS X is not recommended.
	
	If you choose to install MSN Broadband with Mac OS X, be aware of the following:
	
	- To use IE 5.1 for Macintosh: IE 5.1 comes bundled with Mac OS X systems and
	  is already included in your system programs.
	
	- To use MSN Messenger for Macintosh: MSN Messenger can be downloaded for free
	  from http://www.microsoft.com/mac/messenger.
	
	- To send and receive e-mail: Outlook Express (OE) is not compatible with Mac
	  OS X. Microsoft Entourage, which comes bundled with Microsoft Office X for
	  Macintosh, is the only e-mail program compatible for use with MSN Broadband.
	  If you install MSN Broadband with Mac OS X and you do not have Microsoft
	  Entourage, you cannot use your @msn e-mail address to send and receive
	  e-mail.
	
	For more information about using Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and Microsoft
	Entourage with MSN Broadband, visit
