	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to migrate an existing Qwest DSL user who is running
	Mac OS X to set up MSN Broadband powered by Qwest for Macintosh computers with
	both Mac OS 9.2 and Mac OS X installed. MSN Broadband software is designed to
	work with Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x only.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The minimum computer system requirements for MSN Broadband for Macintosh
	computers are as follows:
	
	- PowerPC Macintosh computer (G3 or higher recommended)
	
	- 32 MB of RAM (64 MB or more recommended)
	
	- Mac OS 8.6 or later, not including Mac OS X
	
	- 32 MB of available hard-disk space
	
	- CD-ROM drive
	
	- Ethernet port
	
	- Video resolution of 800 x 600 or higher running thousands of colors
	  (resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher recommended)
	
	- 28.8 Kbps or higher modem (optional, required only for dial-up connections)
	
	The MSN Broadband powered by Qwest software supports Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x only. The
	MSN Broadband software will not install on a Macintosh computer that is running
	OS X. However, because new Macintosh computers come standard with both Mac OS
	9.2 and OS X installed, MSN Broadband can be used, provided your computer is
	running OS 9.2 when configuring the Cisco DSL Modem.
	
	To install the MSN Broadband software on a Macintosh computer running Mac OS 9.2
	
	1. Locate the MSN Broadband Installation Guide included in the Welcome Kit.
	
	2. Follow all setup instructions as described on pages 2 to 5.
	
	To configure the Cisco DSL Modem while running Mac OS X for use with MSN
	Broadband
	
	It is possible to configure your modem to work with MSN Broadband while running
	Mac OS X. However, because the MSN Broadband software will not install on a
	Macintosh computer running Mac OS X, using MSN Broadband with Mac OS requires
	manual configuration of the DSL modem while running Mac OS 9.x. In addition,
	manually configuring the modem and computer to use MSN Broadband does not permit
	installation of the following applications included on the MSN Broadband
	CD-ROM.
	
	- Internet Browser (IE) 5.1 for Macintosh
	
	- MSN Messenger 2.1 for Macintosh
	
	- Outlook Express 5.0.4 for Macintosh
	
	For these reasons, using MSN Broadband with Mac OS X is not recommended.
	
	If you choose to install MSN Broadband with Mac OS X, be aware of the following:
	
	- To use IE 5.1 for Macintosh: IE 5.1 comes bundled with Mac OS X systems and
	  is already included in your system programs.
	
	- To use MSN Messenger for Macintosh: MSN Messenger can be downloaded for free
	  from http://www.microsoft.com/mac/messenger.
	
	- To send and receive e-mail: Outlook Express (OE) is not compatible with Mac
	  OS X. Microsoft Entourage, which comes bundled with Microsoft Office X for
	  Macintosh, is the only e-mail program compatible for use with MSN Broadband.
	  If you install MSN Broadband with Mac OS X and you do not have Microsoft
	  Entourage, you cannot use your @msn e-mail address to send and receive
	  e-mail.
	
	For more information about using Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and Microsoft
	Entourage with MSN Broadband, visit http://www.helpdesk.msn.com/
