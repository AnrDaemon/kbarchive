	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) on your computer running
	Windows NT 4.0, MSMQ can be configured to guarantee "only once" delivery of
	transactional messages without duplicate messages for forty-five days. However,
	it is possible, under certain conditions, to receive duplicate transactional
	messages within a twenty-four hour time frame.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur when the receiving computer is restarting while
	transactional messages are being sent.
