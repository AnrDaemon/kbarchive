## Q241112: ISAPI Filter Cannot be Removed Using HTMLA

	Article: Q241112
	Product(s): Internet Information Server
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix
	Last Modified: 20-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the HTLMA, the ISAPI filter cannot be removed properly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you click Remove, Iifilthd.asp\delItem is called, and then the selected
	filter's onBlur event is triggered. The index of the filter, which lost the
	focus, is stored in Iifilthd.asp\listFunc.sel; however, delItem changes this
	value before the onBlur event is triggered. Therefore, the
	Iifilthd.asp\cachedList[i].filter is covered on the new index.
