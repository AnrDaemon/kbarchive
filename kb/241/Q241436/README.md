## Q241436: XCLN: Outlook for Macintosh Cannot Access Web Services Using Sec

	Article: Q241436
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): MACINTOSH:8.0,8.1,8.2
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, versions 8.0, 8.1, 8.2

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You configure the Outlook Web Services Location with a Secure Sockets Layer
	(SSL) address, which has the prefix https. When you attempt to access Web forms
	at the Web services location, you received an error message:
	
	  HTTP Error 404 URL Not Found
	
	When you verify the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the Web Services Location
	box, you see that Outlook has prepended "http:" to the URL, which renders it
	invalid.
