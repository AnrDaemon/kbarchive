	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) to migrate Novell-based
	servers to Windows NT, it does not provide a method to migrate printer queues.
	Note that this behavior occurs even though this functionality is noted as
	existing at the "Improving Netware to NT Migration" Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://support.microsoft.com/support/ntserver/migration/Improving.asp
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the Migration Tool for NetWare does not provide a
	method for migrating printer queues. The Web site listed earlier contains a
	documentation error.
