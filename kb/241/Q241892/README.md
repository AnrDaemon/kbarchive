	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When sending e-mail to a third-party SMTP server or through a firewall, a
	non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the following may be generated:
	
	  Subject: Notification: Outbound Mail Failure - A protocol error occurred.
	
	  A mail message was not sent due to a protocol error.
	
	  501 syntactically invalid HELO argument(s)
	
	  The message that caused this notification was:
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This error is generated by a third-party SMTP server or firewall.
	
	When the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service establishes a connection to a
	remote host, the Internet Mail Service initiates the SMTP conversation with
	"EHLO <domainname.com>". If an error is returned, the Internet Mail
	Service falls back to "HELO <domainname.com>". If the HELO command returns
	an error, an NDR is generated containing the error.
