	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to connect to the Zone using AOL, you may be unable to connect
	to the Zone and you may receive an error message stating that a file failed to
	download.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you configure the AOL Parent Controls Web Control to
	use any of the following settings:
	
	- Access sites appropriate for ages 12 and under
	
	- Access sites appropriate for ages 13 to 15
	
	- Block explicity mature Web content, access all other Web sites (recommended
	  for ages 16-17)
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, configure the AOL Parental Controls Web Control to use
	a setting that can access the Zone:
	
	1. On the My AOL menu, click Parental Controls.
	
	2. Click Set Parental Controls.
	
	3. In the Edit Controls For box, click the account you want to change.
	
	4. Click Web Control.
	
	5. Click Access all Web Sites (recommended for adults only).
	
	6. Click Save, and then click OK.
	
	7. Close the Parental Controls windows.
	
	NOTE: After you complete these steps, the account in the Edit Controls For box is
	able to connect to any site on the Internet.
