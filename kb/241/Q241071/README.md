	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you are currently using a long-distance access number to connect to MSN, The
	Microsoft Network, it is possible that there may be a local access number for
	your area.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To find out whether or not there is a local access number in your area, go to
	the following Web site:

	For more information on MSN access phone numbers, go to the following Web site:

	Please be aware of the following regarding MSN access numbers:
	
	In some cases, MSN may not have a local MSN Internet access phone number that
	serves your area. Before choosing your primary and backup numbers, you must
	check with your local telephone company to find out which, if any, MSN Internet
	access numbers provide local dialing and what applicable toll charges may be.
	
	MSN accepts no responsibility for, nor has any control over, area code changes or
	other changes made by the telecommunications companies, nor for any long
	distance telephone charges incurred while connecting to MSN. When you are
	notified that a new area code is being introduced in your area, it is your
	responsibility to make the necessary changes in your MSN Settings to ensure that
	you are dialing a local phone number when connecting to MSN (where available).
	MSN maintains an updated phone directory of MSN access numbers, but will not
	necessarily notify you of area code changes or other telephone company changes
	that may affect you.
