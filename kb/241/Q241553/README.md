	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	An Exchange Server user receives a non-delivery report (NDR) when he or she
	clicks Reply All to a message that has been migrated from a Lotus cc:Mail Post
	Office (PO).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The current code logic is that if you get a recipient without the PO name
	information, the PO name that the user is migrated from is used, and it is
	incorrect. The same PO name as the sender should be used.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
	For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft

	STATUS

	listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
	Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.
