	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to use Compression Agent to customize the compression
	methods used to compress the files on a disk.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Compression Agent is included with Microsoft Plus!. You can use Compression
	Agent to recompress the files on a disk using the compression methods you
	specify. You can recompress a disk using a single compression method, or you can
	use different methods for individual files and folders. You can also leave
	individual files and folders uncompressed.
	
	To configure Compression Agent to use different compression methods for
	individual files or folders, or to leave individual files or folders
	uncompressed, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
	  System Tools, and then click Compression Agent.
	
	2. Click Settings, and then click Exceptions.
	
	3. Follow these steps to add an exception:
	
	  a. Click Add.
	
	  b. To set an exception for a file, click File. To set an exception for a
	     folder, click Folder. To set an exception for a particular file type,
	     click All Files Of Specified Extension.
	
	  c. Type the name of the file or folder or file type you want to set an
	     exception for in the box. If you are setting an exception for a file or
	     folder, you can click Browse to locate the file or folder instead of
	     typing the name of the object manually.
	
	  d. Click UltraPack, HiPack, or No Compression to indicate the compression
	     method that should be used for the specified file, folder, or file type.
	
	  e. Click Add.
	
	  f. Repeat steps B-E for each exception you want to set. When you are finished
	     adding exceptions, click Close.
	
	Note that the DriveSpace 3 compression software included with Microsoft Plus!
	supports three compression methods that determine how much your files are
	compressed. The three compression methods are standard, HiPack, and UltraPack.
	
	The standard compression method used by DriveSpace 3 provides better compression
	than the standard compression method used by MS-DOS or Windows 95 DriveSpace or
	MS-DOS DoubleSpace. HiPack provides even better compression than standard
	compression and UltraPack provides the most compression. However, the more disk
	compression you use, the more likely your computer's performance will be
	affected.
