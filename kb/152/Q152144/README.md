	Microsoft Exchange provides the ability to change the display name of a
	Microsoft Exchange Site. This change will also be reflected in the Address Book
	of Microsoft Exchange users.

	While the Display name for the Site can be changed, the Directory name provided
	during installation cannot be changed.

	to start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and follow these steps:
	
	1. Highlight the Site name (under Organization).
	
	2. Choose Properties from the File menu.
	
	3. Change the Display name.
	
	4. Choose OK.
	
	The next time that a Microsoft Exchange client is started, the Display name of
