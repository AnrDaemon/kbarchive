## Q152486: Resolving PC Card Problems on Toshiba 400 Notebook Computers

	Article: Q152486
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 3.50 3.51
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Although Toshiba 400 Notebook Computers are on the Hardware Compatibility List
	(HCL) for Windows NT, a few difficulties can occur due to the power- saving
	features of these notebook computers. Specifically, these problems occur when
	the computer is turned off with "resume mode" enabled or when the computer
	enters "sleep mode." Upon resuming use of the computer after either of these
	conditions, access to PC Card devices may no longer be possible.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Toshiba does provide utilities that allow the resume mode and sleep mode to
	operate with Windows NT without affecting operation of the PC Card devices in
	Windows NT. These utilities are available from the Toshiba web site as
	RNT030US.EXE.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In general, notebook computers are tested for compatibility with Windows NT with
	power conservation features disabled. On a Toshiba notebook computer, this is
	accomplished by booting MS-DOS and running the Toshiba TSETUP utility. Both the
	sleep mode and resume modes should be disabled.
