	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to synchronize an offline public folder with an online public
	folder, and the online public folder has a delete rule, the following error
	might occur:
	
	  This folder could not be synchronized. Consult the synchronization log in the
	  deleted items folder for details.
	
	The synchronization log will contain the following message:
	
	  Error synchronizing message '<message subject>'
	  [80040800-3ED-0-324]
	  Unknown Error.
	  Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
	  Error synchronizing folder
	  [80040800-3ED-0-324]
	  Unknown Error.
	  Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
	
	The message will stay in the offline folder.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The return code generated by the delete operation is treated as an error by the
	synchronization process.
	
	
	STATUS
