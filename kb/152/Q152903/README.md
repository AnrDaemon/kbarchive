## Q152903: XFOR: Mail Connector Dispatch Fails Against Postoffice on Unix

	Article: Q152903
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Microsoft Exchange 4.0 MS Mail Connector against an MS Mail
	Postoffice that is residing on a UNIX server, it will not dispatch mail from the
	Postoffice. Messages will be successfully dispatched into the Postoffice, but
	the following event ID will be generated by the Microsoft Exchange PC MTA in the
	application event log upon attempting to retrieve outbound mail from the
	Postoffice(s) on the UNIX computer:
	
	  Event ID: 4254
	  Unable to deliver mail to \\servername\maildata\P1\XXXXXXXX.0lk
	  MS Mail Connector (PC) MTA will retry in the next cycle.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Mail is not dispatched from the Postoffice because files on the UNIX system are
	written in lower case. The Microsoft Exchange 4.0 Microsoft Mail Connector
	requests creation of the file in upper case and expects \P1\<prefix>.0LK
	files to be generated. Specifically, the semaphore file is thought to be from
	another process when it is not in upper case. As a result, mail will not be
	dispatched.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
	Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
