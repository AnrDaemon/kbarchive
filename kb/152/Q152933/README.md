	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A PowerPoint presentation saved to a public folder fails to start. The following
	error message appears:
	
	  A problem occurred while working with, or connecting to, a linked or embedded
	  object or its source application.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If you create a PowerPoint presentation and save it as a PowerPoint 4.0
	presentation, you may not be able to open the presentation from the Microsoft

	present the error message above. If the presentation was posted to the public
	folder, the presentation will open.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Post the presentation to a public folder and avoid dragging and dropping the
	presentation to public folders.
