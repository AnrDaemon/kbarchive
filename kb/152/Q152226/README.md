	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you open the Tools menu in a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows, the
	Inbox and Out of Office Assistants might be missing.
	
	The following are three possible causes of this:
	
	- The Microsoft Exchange client is low on memory. Restart Windows and try
	  again.
	
	- A non-Microsoft Exchange client extension removed either the Remote Mail or
	  the Find menu items.
	
	- The Microsoft Exchange client extension (Emsuix.dll or Emsuix32.dll) was
	  removed from the Extensions list in the registry or the Exchng.ini file. Run
	  the Microsoft Exchange client Setup program and choose the Reinstall option.
