	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The status bar in the Remote Mail window of a Microsoft Exchange client for
	Windows has a Last Update: time on the left side. When you download the headers,
	this time gets updated to reflect the time of the download. However, when you
	shut down the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows and at a later time restart
	it, the time is not saved. It gets reset to the very first time the Remote Mail
	window was opened on the system.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Windows
	95, Windows 3.x, and Windows NT clients version 4.0. This problem was corrected
	in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 2. For information on
	obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
