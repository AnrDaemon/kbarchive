{% raw %}

	Article: Q152127
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 3.5,3.51
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 20-FEB-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a network installation of Microsoft Windows 95 is directed to a Microsoft
	Windows NT Server on either File Allocation Table (FAT) or Windows NT File
	System (NTFS) for the path of the installation, the dates of all the files are
	changed to reflect the current date. This causes problems with system management
	when trying to determine the correct date and time of Microsoft Windows 95
	files.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
	3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	Additional query words: setup 95 3.50 3.51
