	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Iomega Jaz and ZIP SCSI devices are recognized by Windows NT as removable
	media devices and are treated like any other removable media under Windows NT.
	It is important to note, however, that additional software from Iomega is needed
	in order to work with write-protected media.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Most removable media provide a hardware based mechanism for write- protecting of
	the media. For example, a 3.5-inch floppy disk uses a sliding tab that can be
	moved to one position to allow writes, and another position to protect the media
	from being written to.
	
	Iomega employs a software based scheme which requires a utility to write- protect
	the media or to remove write-protection. The utilities provided with the ZIP
	drives and Jaz drives do not function in Windows NT.
	
	A set of utilities for Windows NT that will resolve this difficulty is available
	on Iomega's web server. Please contact Iomega for details on obtaining these
	utilities.
