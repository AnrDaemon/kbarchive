	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After you select the Set as Default check box when connecting to a server or
	starting a monitor, the server is not automatically connected to the next time
	the action is completed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Selecting the Set as Default check box sets the default server for the next time
	the connection is attempted; however, the connection is not automatically
	initiated
	
	This is by design. If the connection were fully initiated without prompting, the
	administrator would not be able to change the server that was being connected
	to. The functionality provided by the Set as Default check box is that the
	server previously specified should appear automatically in the box so that the
	browse button does not have to be used.
