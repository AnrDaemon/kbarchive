	Service packs are the means by which Windows NT product updates are distributed.
	Service packs keep the product current, and extend and update your computer's
	functionality. Service packs include updates, system administration tools,
	drivers, and additional components. All are conveniently bundled for easy
	downloading. Service packs are cumulative -- each new service pack contains all
	the fixes in previous service packs, as well as any new fixes. You do not need
	to install a previous service pack before you install the latest one.
