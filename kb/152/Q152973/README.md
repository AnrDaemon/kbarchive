	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Setprop.exe is a sample that allows developers to add properties to objects at
	run time.
	
	This behavior cannot be accomplished through the FoxPro language, but can be done
	with the Library Construction Kit (LCK). You can download the source code and
	libraries that provide this functionality using Setprop.exe.
