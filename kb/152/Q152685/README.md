	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can digitally sign and encrypt messages when you work offline.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Digital signatures only require your personal public and/or private signing key
	pair, and they are stored in your .EPF file. The encrypted messages require the
	recipient's public encryption key, and it is stored in the global address book.
	Therefore, you can encrypt messages offline as long as you have downloaded the
	offline address book with full details.
