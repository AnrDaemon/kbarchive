	- Microsoft Cinemania for Macintosh, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 editions 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses importing your ListMaker files from one version of
	Cinemania to later versions.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use your ListMaker file from another version of Cinemania, use the steps
	below for your versions of the program:
	
	Importing Cinemania 1994 ListMaker file into Cinemania 1995
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	1. Install Cinemania 1995 on your machine.
	
	2. Open the Cinemania '94 Prefs Folder. This folder is located in the System
	  folder: Preferences folder.
	
	3. Locate the list(s) you created in Cinemania 1994.
	
	4. Drag your list(s) to the Cinemania Folder. This folder is also located in the
	  System folder: Preferences folder.
	
	  NOTE: This folder is created when Cinemania 1995 is installed on your machine.
	
	5. Start Cinemania 1995.
	
	6. Click the ListMaker button. Your list(s) appear in the box under Movie List.
	
	Importing Cinemania 1995 ListMaker file into Cinemania 1996
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	When Cinemania 1996 is installed on your computer, it locates the existing
	Cinemania Folder in the System folder: Preferences folder. By default, Cinemania
	1995 and Cinemania 1996 lists are stored in this location, therefore Cinemania
	1996 automatically imports Cinemania 1995 lists.
	
	Importing Cinemania 1994 ListMaker file into Cinemania 1996 or 1997
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The file format used in the 1994 version is different from the 1996, and 1997
	versions, which means you cannot directly import your Cinemania 1994 lists into
	Cinemania 1996 nor Cinemania 1997. To import Cinemania 1994 files to the 1996
	edition, you need to import the list to Cinemania 1995, then let Cinemania 1996
	or Cinemania 1997 automatically import the lists from Cinemania 1995.
	
	Note: Cinemania 1996 and 1997 have compatible formats for ListMaker files.
	Therefore, they are interchangeable.
