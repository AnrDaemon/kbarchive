	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you have a Microsoft Exchange profile set up to access a mailbox and that
	user has Microsoft Schedule+ appointments, when you copy that profile and change
	the mailbox in the new profile, the new user will still be able access the
	previous user's Microsoft Schedule+ appointments and calendar.
	
	This behavior will only occur when the original profile has been used at least
	once with Microsoft Schedule+ and is by design.
