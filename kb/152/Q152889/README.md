## Q152889: XCLN: Digital Signature Overwrites the Message Body

	Article: Q152889
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage
	Last Modified: 30-MAR-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you send a message from a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows with
	attachments and Digital Signature encryption enabled, if the send fails due to a
	mailbox limitation error and you send the message again, the Digital Signature
	will overwrite the body of the message. This will result in a message being sent
	without a body.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients
	listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
	Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the
	service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
