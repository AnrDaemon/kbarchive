	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to configure Directory
	Synchronization (DirSync) with MS Mail, you have the option to export or not to
	export custom recipients during a DirSync cycle. This option can be found on the
	Export Containers tab of either a DirSync Requestor or a Remote DirSync
	Requestor.
	
	This option affects all Custom Recipients, including those created manually,
	through import files, or created automatically through the DirSync process.
