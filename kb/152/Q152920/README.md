## Q152920: XCLN: MAPIOle Attachments from OLEMsg have no Rendering Data

	Article: Q152920
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the MAPIOle type of attachment in OLEMsg, the message will be
	missing the rendering data for the OLE object. For example, when the message is
	opened in the Microsoft Exchange client, nothing is displayed for the object
	unless you click the place where the object is supposed to be.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The OLE object is displayed too small to be legible and appears completely
	blank.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use the Microsoft Exchange client's Object command on the Insert Menu to insert
	the object.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
	version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
	in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
	obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
