## Q152957: XADM: Non-Delivery Reports Incorrectly Returned in German

{% raw %}

	Article: Q152957
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:4.0

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	This behavior has been observed in Windows NT versions 3.51 and 4.0 and is
	independent of which language version of Microsoft Exchange Server is
	installed.
	
	Non-delivery reports (NDRs) from Admin.exe are returned in German when the
	Regional Settings in Control Panel for Windows NT are set to Spanish. Normal
	NDRs generated by the Microsoft Exchange Server continue to be in the correct
	language. The problem occurs when mail is returned from the Messages Queued page
	in the Microsoft Mail Connector object and the "Send Non-Delivery Reports when
	messages deleted" checkbox is selected. The message is deleted and an NDR is
	generated, but the message returning to the original sender is in German.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Service Pack 3 of Microsoft Exchange
	version 4.0 For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
	following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
