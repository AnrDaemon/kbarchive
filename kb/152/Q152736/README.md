	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you request a Read Receipt and send a Microsoft Schedule+ meeting request to
	a user who has set Microsoft Schedule+ to Automatically Accept Meeting Requests,
	you will not receive the Read Receipt.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This also happens with cancel meeting requests.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This is by design of Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0. Read Receipts will not be
	generated when auto-processing of meeting requests is performed.
