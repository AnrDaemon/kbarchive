	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	With the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, there are no click-and-drag
	capabilities between the operating system and the Microsoft Exchange client. You
	cannot move (or insert) a file into a folder or an open message using a
	"drag-and-drop" operation.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	In order to insert a file into a folder from the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh
	client:
	
	1. Log on to the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client.
	
	2. On the Tools menu, click Customize Toolbar.
	
	3. In the "Available buttons" dialog box, select the "File - Insert" button.
	
	4. In the "Toolbar buttons" dialog box, slect the button immediately following
	  the place you want to put the Insert button.
	
	5. Click Add and click Close.
	
	6. Now from any folder click the "File - Insert" button that you just added to
	  the toolbar. This allows the posting of files to folders, either in your
	  server mailbox, public folders, or a personal storage (.PST) file.
	
	-OR-
	
	1. Highlight the folder.
	
	2. On the File menu, click Insert and follow the prompts to select the file..
	
	To insert a file into an open message from the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh
	client, do one of the following:
	
	1. Log on to the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client.
	
	2. On the Compose menu, click New Message.
	
	3. On the View menu, click Toolbar.
	
	4. Now the default toolbar is displayed from within a message. On this toolbar
	  is an "Insert File" button. (It looks like a paper clip.) Clicking this
	  button from any new message allows you to post files to any message body.
	
	-OR-
	
	1. Log on to the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client.
	
	2. On the Compose menu, click New Message.
	
	3. On the Insert menu, click File.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Apple Operating System does not fully support the Microsoft OLE drivers.
	Microsoft has written a limited OLE driver set to be used with Microsoft
	Exchange. This allows for click-and-drag functions within the client, but no
	click-and-drag functions between the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client and the
	Apple operating system.
