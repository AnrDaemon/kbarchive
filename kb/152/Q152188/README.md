	This article provides a description of Magic School Bus Explores the Solar
	System.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Imagine going on a nice trip to the planetarium and having the bus you're riding
	in "morph" into a rocket ship that's headed straight for outer space, and then
	losing your teacher without a clue as to where she might be.
	
	No lie, with the Friz, this stuff happens. So get ready for the ride of your
	life.
	
	Yes, you are lost in the Solar System; your only hope of escape lies in your
	ability to win games, where you win tokens for the Friz Finder.
	
	Some of your classmates have written reports about the Solar System and there are
	some very cool fact sheets and science experiments, too.
	
	When you get to each planet surface, click on the WhatsIt to play the games. Win
	the game and you get a token for the Friz Finder. Use the Friz Finder to get up
	to three hints about which planet she is located on. When you think you've
	figured out which planet she's on, go to that planet and use the Friz Finder to
	see if you're right.
	
	When you've found the Friz, you've won.
	
	The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System is designed for kids of all ages,
	especially those 6-10. The program is based on a series of books from Scholastic
	publishing, one of the leading publishers of kids books. In addition to the
	books, MSB Solar is also being marketed in conjunction with a Magic School Bus
	animated series on PBS and McDonald's Happy Meals.
