	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Microphone Wizard in the Encarta Language Learning programs listed at the
	beginning of this article may not adjust the microphone volume.
	
	As a result, when you attempt to record a voice in the Encarta Language Learning
	software, the voice may not be recorded.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if an Alternative Microphone setting is enabled on your
	computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, turn off the Alternative Microphone setting:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Accessories.
	
	2. Click Entertainment or Multimedia, and then click Volume Control.
	
	3. On the Options menu, click Properties.
	
	4. Click Recording, and then click OK.
	
	5. On the Options menu, click Advanced Controls.
	
	6. Click Advanced.
	
	7. Click to clear the Alternative Microphone check box (if it is present), and
	  then click Close.
	
	8. Move the Volume slider under the Mic column to adjust microphone sensitivity.
	
	9. Close all open windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Alternative Microphone setting is available if a Crystal Audio Systems
	CS4616 sound card is installed in the computer.
	
	If the sound card has the Alternative Microphone setting, you cannot run the
	Microphone wizard. The Microphone wizard resets the Alternative Microphone
	setting.
	
	You can use Sound Recorder to check the microphone volume.
