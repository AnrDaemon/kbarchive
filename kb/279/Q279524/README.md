	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When MSN Companion dials the toll-free set-up numbers, you can hear the dialing
	and the modem handshake (squawking). However, instead of connecting, the screen
	shows one of the following:
	
	- A blank page that only allows the user to redial.
	
	- A message box:
	
	  File can't run
	
	- A message box:
	
	  Sorry, this web page can't be found. If you just typed in this web page's
	  address, please check your spelling.
	
	  Clicking Enter results in a shaded blue background screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a standard connection issue. Probable causes:
	
	- Too much Internet traffic congestion is interferring with the signal. it is a
	  busy time of day, and a lot of users are trying to connect at this time.
	
	- There is an issue with the modems or the lines at the toll-free MSN numbers.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	1. In most cases this is just a high-traffic issue, and retrying will usually
	  get it to work.
	
	2. If retrying doesn't work, try dialing again. But this time, skip the first
	  number and instead dial the second number. You can do this by pressing the
	  "skip to next number" button in the dialing box.
	
	3. If this doesn't work, wait a few hours and try again.
	
	4. To see if there is a problem with the toll-free numbers check with MSN
	  Technical Support at (888) 386-6497.
