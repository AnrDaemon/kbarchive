	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the MSN Companion tries to browse to http://hotmail.com you don't see the
	regular Hotmail home page. Instead, you may get either a irrelevant log-in page,
	or a page that tells you that you need WebTV or a compatible browser (IE4 or
	IE5).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Hotmail currently does not recognize the MSN Companion as a supported browser.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	There is currently no resolution to this. The Hotmail team is working to fix
	this shortly.
