	is made available in New York at 3:00, in Chicago at 2:00, in London at 8:00,
	and so on. If you want the advertisement to be made available at a specific hour

	"By default, the advertisement will be made available at the local time within

	New York, it is made available in New York at 3:00, in Chicago at 3:00, in
	London at 3:00, and so on. If you want the advertisement to be made available at
	an absolute time independent of time zone, check the Greenwich Mean Time check
	box."
