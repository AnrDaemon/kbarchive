	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	E-mail functions don't work. This could happen either during Set-up, or during
	normal e-mail usage.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This could be caused by either:
	
	- The Hotmail mail servers are having temporary problems. In this case,
	  browsing to your mailbox using hotmail.com would not work.
	
	-or-
	
	- The Hotmail DAV service that allows MSN Companion to access the mailbox is
	  having temporary problems. In this case, browsing to your mailbox using
	  hotmail.com would work, but trying to view your e-mail in MSN Companion, MSN
	  Explorer, or Outlook Express would not work.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Troubleshooting Options
	-----------------------
	
	I. Try browsing to www.hotmail.com and accessing your member_id@msn.com mailbox
	from there. If this fails, then you know it's a temporary problem with the
	Hotmail mail servers. The problem should resolve itself within a few minutes or
	hours.
	
	II. Try to access your Hotmail mailbox using Outlook Express on a personal
	computer:
	
	  To set up Outlook Express to look at your Hotmail mailbox
	
	  1. In Outlook Express, click Tools and then click Accounts.
	
	  2. Click Add and then click Mail.
	
	  3. In the Display name box type MSN Companion and then click Next.
	
	  4. Select I already have and e-mail address that I'd like to use, in the E-mail
	  address box type your e-mail address, and then click Next.
	
	  5. At My incoming mail server is a ... server select HTTP, at My HTTP mail
	  service is select Hotmail, and then click Next.
	
	  6. In the Account name box type you e-mail address, in the Password box type
	  your password, and then click Next.
	
	  7. Click Finish.
	
	In Outlook Express go to the Inbox of this account. If there is an error, the
	Hotmail DAV service is probably temporarily down. Try again in a few minutes or
	hours.
	
	III. If possible, try to access your mailbox using MSN Explorer on a personal
	computer:
	
	1. If you haven't already, add your account as a new user in MSN Explorer.
	
	2. Log on as that user, and go to E-mail.
	
	3. If there is an error, the Hotmail DAV service is probably temporarily down.
	  Try again in a few minutes or hours.
