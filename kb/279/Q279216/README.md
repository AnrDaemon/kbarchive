	=======
	
	This article descries how Notes invitation calendar messages that are not yet
	accepted are migrated.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you run the Migration wizard, and the Schedule Information option is the only
	option that is selected, the wizard does not migrate the Notes invitation
	calendar messages that are not yet accepted. If you click to select the
	"Personal E-Mail Messages" option, these calendar messages are migrated to the
	Inbox folder instead of the Calendar folder.
	
	The Notes invitation calendar messages that are not yet accepted are listed with
	a Notice value in the Notes Form properties.
