	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	It is not possible to change an e-mail address or member ID. It is only possible
	to cancel and account and open a new account.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is not recommended for MSN Companion customers. You will need to cancel
	your MSN account and create an entirely new MSN account. This will also change
	their e-mail, and an entirely new e-mail mailbox. None of your existing e-mail
	will be moved to the new mailbox and no mail forwarding is available.
	
	You could, however, access your old e-mail using www.hotmail.com or by using the
	new MSN Explorer on a personal computer connected to the Internet.
	
	To cancel your existing account and open a new account call Customer Service at
	(888) 765-2411.
	
	Once this is done, reset the MSN Companion using the "MURMUR" code. See Q279037 -
	MSN Companion Troubleshooting Tool MURMUR
	
	The Setup screens will typically automatically detect your new information. If
	they do not, you will be given an opportunity to type in your new member id and
	password.
	
	You should be all set up with your new member id.
