	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When new e-mail arrives, the e-mail indicator light does not turn on.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	There are two ways that the MSN Companion notifies you of new e-mail: the pop-up
	notification at the bottom of the screen, and the e-mail light.
	
	Neither of these will trigger if you are currently looking at your e-mail screen.
	In order for these to come on, you must be looking at the Start page, other MSN
	Companion pages, or other Web pages.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	1. Make certain that new e-mail arrived when you are not looking at the e-mail
	  page.
	
	2. Confirm that this is not a software problem:
	  a. Compose a quick e-mail to yourself.
	
	  b. Right after you send the e-mail, go right to the Start page before it
	     arrives.
	
	  c. Wait on the Start page until the e-mail arrives.
	
	  d. When the e-mail arrives, a notification message will pop up near the
	     bottom of the screen. If this notification pop-up appears, then you know
	     that the software notifications are working, and this is not a software
	     problem.
	
	3. If the notification pop-up appeared but the e-mail light under the screen
	  never lit up, then it's a hardware failure. Contact the manufacturer or the
	  retail store for a replacement.
