	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	MSN Companion device has worked fine, but now when the customer turns it on,
	instead of the Start page, they get a page that asks them to choose new access
	numbers.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Every night MSN Companion dials up MSN and checks to make sure that the user's
	access numbers are still current. If the numbers are no longer current, then
	each time the user turns on the device, it will go straight to a Your Internet
	Numbers Have Changed page.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You need to use this page to choose new local access numbers. Once you do this,
	the MSN Companion will start up as usual.
