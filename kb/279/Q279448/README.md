	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you go to the Address Book, all previous entries are missing and when you
	try to re-type some of the missing addresses, you get an error saying the
	address already exists.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a temporary condition caused by how addresses on the MSN Companion
	device are cached (stored).
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Unplug the power cord from the MSN Companion device and then plug it back in.
	After the device starts up again, the problem should be resolved.
	
	Note that the problem typically resolves itself overnight, but pulling the plug
	and plugging it back in is a lot quicker.
