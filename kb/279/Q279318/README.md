	Article: Q279318
	Product(s): The Microsoft Network
	Version(s): 1.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The device attempts to connect to the local access number?
	
	- it gets a dialtone?
	
	- it dials the number?
	
	- you hear the handshake (modem squawking)?
	
	- but after that it fails to connect and goes to the "connection problem"
	  screen.
	
	Note: this can also happen during Setup when the device dials the local number.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The device failed to authenticate against MSN with this member id and password.
	
	Possible causes:
	
	- There is a problem with the MSN authentication service.
	
	- There is a problem with the authentication at the local access number.
	
	- The user's password on the server is out-of-sync with the password stored
	  locally on their device.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	1. Check to see if this is a server issue with the authentication service:
	
	  a. If you have access to another MSN Companion device, try starting it and
	     check if it can log in without problems.
	
	  b. Wait for a few minutes or hours, or try again during off-peak hours.
	
	  c. Check with MSN to see if there is an existing problem with the
	     authentication service. Call Technical Support at (888) 386-6497.
	
	2. Check with MSN to see if there is a current issue with the local access
	  numbers that you are using. Sometimes dialup will work on these numbers, but
	  authentication will fail. Call Technical Support at (888) 386-6497.
	
	3. If there doesn't appear to be a problem with the MSN servers or local access
	  numbers, then this is a password-out-of-sync problem.
	
	  This means that the password stored on the device is not the same as the
	  password stored on the MSN server. You will need to change the password
	  stored on your MSN Companion.
	
	  Call MSN Customer Service at (888) 765-2411 and ask for for a password reset.
	
	  Customer Service will direct you to type a reset password into the device
	  using the FIXIT pages. For more information on the FIXIT pages see Q278481
	  MSN Companion FIXIT Pages
	
	  If you have the password lock feature turned on you will turn the unit off and
	  back on, and then type your reset password into the password lock box.
