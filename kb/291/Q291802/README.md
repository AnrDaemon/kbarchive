	CD-ROM: \Support Directory Not Included In Training Kit CD-ROMs
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	
	In several places in the Microsoft Systems Management Server Training text (e.g.
	page 523), the text makes reference to utilities that can be found in the
	\Support or the \Support\Debug directories on the Microsoft Systems Management
	Server compact disc. However, these directories cannot be found on the CD-ROMs
	that are included with the training kit.
	
	The evaluation edition of Microsoft Systems Management Server does not include
	the \Support directory.
