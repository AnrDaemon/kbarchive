	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Page 86: Incorrect Menu Name
	----------------------------
	
	On page 86, under the second heading, in the 4th and 7th lines, change "View
	menu" to "Tools menu."
	
	Change:
	"Then choose the Folder Options command on the View menu, click the View tab, and
	click the Like Current Folder button. To return all these display options to
	their original settings (those that were in place when you installed Windows),
	choose Folder Options from the View menu..."
	
	To:
	"Then choose the Folder Options command on the Tools menu, click the View tab,
	and click the Like Current Folder button. To return all these display options to
	their original settings (those that were in place when you installed Windows),
	choose Folder Options from the Tools menu..."
	
	
	Page 133: First Bulleted Item Should Say "Except 5 or 0"
	--------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 133, in the first bulleted item, change the first sentence to read
	"...any number key except 5 or 0."
	
	Change:
	"To move the mouse pointer, press any number key except 5."
	
	To:
	"To move the mouse pointer, press any number key except 5 or 0."
	
	
	Page 290: Figure 16-6 Is An Incorrect Representation
	----------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 290, Figure 16-6 is incorrect. The correct figure would show the Local
	Area Network Internet Configuration page of the Internet Connection Wizard.
	
	
	Page 448-9: Incorrect Text & Graphic For Internet Directory
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	Page 448-9 contains incorrect information on Microsoft Internet Directory.
	
	Change the last bulleted item on page 448 to:
	"Microsoft Internet Directory displays your MSN Messenger Service contacts and
	lets you know which ones are currently online. To use Microsoft Internet
	Directory, you and the people you want to contact must have MSN Messenger
	Service and a Microsoft Passport. Both are free; visit messenger.msn.com for
	details. Unlike ILS directories, Microsoft Internet Directory doesn?t broadcast
	your name to everyone who logs on to the directory; only users who have added
	you to their list of MSN Messenger Service contacts can see your name and
	availability. In addition to guarding your privacy, this shields you from the
	all-too-explicit listings that clutter many ILS directories."
	
	Figure 21-2 should show MSN Messenger Service, and the caption at left should
	say:
	"Microsoft Internet Directory lists only your MSN Messenger Service contacts."
	
	
	Page 678: 5th Bulleted Item Is Incorrect
	----------------------------------------
	
	On page 678, in the 5th bulleted item, the word "Left" should be deleted as
	either Shift key will work.
	
	Change:
	"Press Ctrl+Left Shift+Esc"
	
	To:
	"Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc"
