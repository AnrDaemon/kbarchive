	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A user wishes to send a file to another person, but the file is too large to
	send as an e-mail attachment. An alternative is to transmit files via MSN
	Messenger, because Messenger does not a place a size limit on transferred files.
	However, other limitations exist. Users who are behind firewalls (a Local Area
	Network), may not be able to transfer files to anyone outside of their local
	network. Also, Messenger file transfers only work if both the user sending the
	file and the recipient are online at the same time and both parties are using
	MSN Messenger.
