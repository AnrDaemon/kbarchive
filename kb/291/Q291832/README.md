## Q291832: Customers Do Not Receive E-mail From MSN.com Or Hotmail.com Doma

	Article: Q291832
	Product(s): The Microsoft Network
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 13-MAR-2002
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You are using a legacy version of the MSN software (pre-6.0), you install and
	signs in with MSN Explorer, which converts e-mail to a Web-based account. You
	decide to revert back to POP3-based email, and use the POP3 rollback tool (at
	http://supportservices.msn.com/us/pop3mig/). You may then receive e-mail in
	Outlook Express from everyone except users with MSN.com or Hotmail accounts.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This can happen because e-mail from users with MSN.com and Hotmail accounts is
	still being routed to your Web-based (Hotmail) e-mail account.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To determine if this is the problem
	
	1. Connect to MSN.
	
	2. Using either Internet Explorer or MSN Explorer, go to http://www.hotmail.com
	  and sign in with the MSN.com account. Select MSN.com in the drop-down box
	  beside the box for the sign-in name.
	
	3. Check for new e-mail from users with Hotmail.com or MSN.com domains in their
	  addresses that were previously not viewable in Outlook or Outlook Express.
	
	If this is the case, contact technical support for further assistance.
