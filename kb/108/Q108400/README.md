## Q108400: Art Gallery: Quick Keys &amp; Mouse Invoke &quot;Go Back&quot; Differently

	Article: Q108400

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Art Gallery for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Art Gallery can behave differently if you use the mouse versus if you use the
	keyboard when you choose the "Go Back" option to return to a screen you were
	looking at before. A popup that was open in the previous window will be closed
	if you Go Back using the mouse, but it will still be open if you Go Back using
	the keyboard.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Art Gallery version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
