	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If print jobs were not completely printing from MS-DOS-based applications as
	described in article Q113130 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and you installed
	a new WINPRINT.DLL and set the data type to TEXT, you may still experience
	problems. When you print from a graphics-based application on an MS-DOS client,
	many irrelevant extra pages print.
