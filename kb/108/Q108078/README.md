	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 does not ship with the Dr.
	Watson (DRWATSON.EXE) utility; however, if you upgrade Windows 3.1 or
	Windows for Workgroups 3.1 to Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Dr. Watson
	remains installed on your hard disk, however, its icon may no longer
	appear. If you created an icon for DRWATSON.EXE and placed it in one the
	Windows default program groups, such as the Startup group, the Dr. Watson
	icon is removed.
	
	NOTE: Dr. Watson is included in Windows versions 3.1 and 3.11 and Windows
	for Workgroups version 3.1. It is not included with Windows 3.0 or Windows
	for Workgroups 3.11.
