	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you create a new directory on drive B using Norton Desktop for Windows
	(NDW), the NDW File Manager may display the newly created directory on both
	drives B and C.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when you have configured NDW to view collapsible trees (by
	choosing Use Collapsible Tree from the Tree menu) and you have windows for both
	drives B and C visible on the screen simultaneously. If the C window is not
	visible, it is refreshed by the time you display it and will not show the
	incorrect directory.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can work around this situation by choosing to update the display. For more
	information on this problem, contact Symantec Technical Support.
