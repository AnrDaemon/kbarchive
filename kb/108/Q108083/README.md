	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A custom form created by a user may not be listed in the list of available forms
	when the user attempts to assign the form to a source.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	One possible cause is that if the newly created form has margins defined greater
	than what the printer driver has defined, the newly created form will not show
	up. This is true even if the printer is capable of handling the margins you
	specify.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
	Advanced Server versions 3.x and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
	post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
