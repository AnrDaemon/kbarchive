## Q108491: Writer 1: Upside Down Pages Not Dithered

	Article: Q108491

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Upside down "Spletters" (special text created using the Shape tool) are not
	dithered (shaded) when you print them. In other words, they print out only in
	black and white, not in shades of gray or colors.
	
	You are most likely to notice this problem when you are printing cards. (Some of
	the pages on cards are printed upside down, so that they will be right-side-up
	when you fold them.)
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer version 1.0 1.1
	and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Normally, the dithering is done by the printer. Upside down pages, however, are
	sent to the printer as bitmaps, which cannot be modified by the printer.
	Printers can't dither bitmaps.
