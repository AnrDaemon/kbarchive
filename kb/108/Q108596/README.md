	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Flight Simulator version 4.0, View 1 may appear as one or more solid colors
	or may contain an image that looks like a runway if the Spot Plane view is
	selected.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If the position of the spot plane coincides with the position of the actual
	aircraft or the positions are very close together, the spot plane view will be
	blocked by the other aircraft. To correct the problem, use the following steps:
	
	1. From the Views menu, click Set Spot Plane.
	
	2. Increase either the Distance or Altitude or both. This will move the spot
	  plane away from the actual aircraft.
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM
	------------------------------
	
	1. From the Views menu, click Set Spot Plane.
	
	2. Set both the Distance and Altitude to 0 (zero).
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	4. Press COMMAND+H.
	
	5. Click Spot.
