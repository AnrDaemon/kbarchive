## Q108398: Art Gallery: Animations Play Incorrectly on Second Screen

	Article: Q108398
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): MACINTOSH:1.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Art Gallery for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Animations will not run properly on a second screen. There are two different
	scenarios in which this problem has been noted:
	
	- A PowerBook 160 that has a 256-color second screen:
	
	  On this system, if Art Gallery initially starts up on the PowerBook's own
	  (16-color) screen and you drag the Art Gallery window to the second
	  (256-color) monitor, animations that you play will play in 16 colors instead
	  of 256 colors.
	
	- A Macintosh with two 256-color screens:
	
	  On this system, if you launch Art Gallery and drag an animation page so that
	  it overlaps both screens, and then play it, Art Gallery will only animate the
	  portion on the first screen. The part of the animation page on the second
	  screen will not move at all. If you then drag the window mostly onto the
	  second screen, the animation will stop altogether.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Art Gallery version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, you must configure your system so that the main screen is
	the only one on which Art Gallery is running.
