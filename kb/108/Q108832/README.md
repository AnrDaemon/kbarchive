	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows does not download unread mail
	on the postoffice when when you select the Immediately On Send option and then
	send a message--even if the option Send All And Retrieve Unread Messages is
	selected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Immediately on Send option is for users in a hurry, so it was designed not
	to retrieve unread mail. To do that, you must connect to the Microsoft Mail
	postoffice using the View menu Connect Now option.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Immediately On Send and Send All And Retrieve Unread Messages options are
	available in the Session Setup dialog box, which you can access through the Mail
	menu Session Setup choice.
