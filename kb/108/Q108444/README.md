	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you perform a search for information that appears in several different places
	in Art Gallery, the list of titles found doesn't differentiate between the
	entries.
	
	For example, if you search on the word "Madonna," the resulting list includes
	twelve separate instances of the title "The Madonna and Child with Saints."
	However, the list doesn't indicate which sections of Art Gallery the twelve
	different instances of this painting or paintings are in.
	
	The Art Gallery Find list also doesn't differentiate between similar painting
	names, such as "Modonna and Child with Saints John the Baptist and Catherine of
	Alexandria," and "Madonna and Child with Saints James the Greater, Jerome, the
	Infant Baptist, and Catherine of Alexandria." These painting names are both
	simply shortened to "the Madonna and Child with Saints."
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========

	search word to your query. This searches only on the list you have already
	found.
