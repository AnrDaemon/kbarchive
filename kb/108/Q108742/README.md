	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Page 47 of the Microsoft LAN Manager Remote Access Service (RAS)
	"Administrator's Guide" for RAS 1.1 and page 43 of the same manual for RAS 1.0
	have the following documentation errors in the section titled "Line Status."
	
	- Each occurrance of "Line Status," one in the title and one in the first
	  sentence, should actually be "Line Condition" because there is no "Line
	  Status" field in the Remote Access Server Service "Port Status" dialog box.
	
	- In the section titled "Line Status," the second bold item, "Not Yet
	  Authenticated," is a non-existent Line Condition. This item should be
	  replaced with "Connected, Authenticating User."
	
	- Each occurrance of "Modem Errors," one in the title and one in the first
	  sentence, should actually be "Modem Condition" because there is no "Modem
	  Errors" field in the Remote Access Server Service "Port Status" dialog box.
	
	- In the section titled "Modem Errors," the first bold item, "None," is a
	  non-existent Modem Condition. This item should be replaced with "No errors."
