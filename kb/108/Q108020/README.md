	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The picture of the control display unit (CDU) of the Boeing 747-400 on page 73
	of "Microsoft Flight Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer" is not correct.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The text accompanying the graphic states that the CDU simply "displays the
	current frequencies of the NAV1 and NAV2 radios and the ADF. It also displays
	the OBS radial for the NAV1 and the bearing for NAV2." The CDU does not display
	other information as the picture indicates.
