	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Flight Simulator retail packaging states the system requirement as:
	
	- MS-DOS operating system version 3.2 or later
	
	- 386 or higher microprocessor
	
	- 530K conventional memory and 256K extended memory (1 MB expanded or extended
	  memory needed to view all elements)
	
	- High-density disk drive
	
	- EGA or VGA display (Super VGA and color monitor recommended)
	
	- Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device recommended
	
	- Sound board recommended
	
	- Compatible with joystick and flight yoke
	
	Note the following adjustments:
	
	- The amount of memory should be 560K conventional and 2 MB expanded or
	  extended to view all elements.
	
	- The program requires approximately 10 MB of free hard disk space to install.
	  Once installation is completed, the files use approximately 8.6 MB of disk
	  space.
	
	NOTE: If you are using some type of disk compression utility such as DoubleSpace,
	Stacker, and so on. You may have to make more space available. The files are
	already compressed and many will not compress further.
