	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	According to Tandy Technical Support, MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 are not supported
	operating systems on the original 1000 and 1200HD computers. The highest version
	of MS-DOS that is supported on the 1000 is 03.20.22, and the highest on the
	1200HD is 02.11.41.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 are not compatible with the BIOS and architecture of the
	original 1000 machine. Customers who install MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 may experience
	floppy disk drive and keyboard problems (among others). Upgrading the BIOS on
	this machine does not correct these problems.
	
	MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 cannot be installed on the 1200HD computer. When you type
	"setup" (without the quotation marks), the cursor drops to the next line and the
	machine stops responding (hangs). This behavior occurs whether or not you use
	any command-line switches. The computer must be rebooted.
	
	For more information regarding this behavior, call Tandy Technical Support.
	
	The 1000 and 1200HD computers are manufactured by Tandy Corporation, a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	these products' performance or reliability.
