	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some of the extended character set fonts do not display or print all characters
	in Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows. The extended character set font names
	are preceded by a 2-letter code indicating a Bitstream character set. (For
	example. "BN Swiss" refers to the Swiss font in the Business character set.) One
	character known to disappear in Word is the apostrophe (').
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Bitstream TypeCity cartridge is a font cartridge for Hewlett-Packard (HP)
	LaserJet printers that has slots for smaller font cartridges. Bitstream sells a
	variety of these "mini" font cartridges and many of them can be plugged into the
	TypeCity cartridge at one time.
	
	The software for the TypeCity cartridge includes Bitstream Facelift. The "README"
	file states that applications that do their own character mapping may be unable
	to access all characters when Facelift is installed.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
	or reliability.
