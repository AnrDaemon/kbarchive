	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you double-click on EtherTalk in the Network dialog box of Control Panel to
	view a list of zones, your Macintosh workstation stops responding (hangs). The
	workstation begins running again after you stop the AppleTalk protocol from the
	Windows NT Advanced Server (use the Devices icon in Control Panel to stop the
	AppleTalk protocol).
	
	This problem occurs only when U.S. Service Pack 2 is installed on the Windows NT
	Advanced Server.
	
	This problem does not occur when you use Chooser to change zones.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
	version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT Server version 3.5.
	This problem has also been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows
	NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For information on obtaining the
	Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
