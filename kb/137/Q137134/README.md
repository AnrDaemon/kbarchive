	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run applications under Windows NT 3.51, buttons, fonts, and text in
	dialog boxes is misplaced or clipped by another control or the dialog frame. The
	same executable file works correctly under Windows NT version 3.5.
	
	This problem has been reproduced on applications compiled with Visual C/C++
	version 2.1 and 2.2. The problem is independent of video hardware, video
	drivers, screen resolution, or computer type.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You may be able to workaround the problem by using the large system font:
	
	1. Run Control Panel.
	
	2. Choose Display.
	
	3. In the Font Size list box choose Large Fonts.
	
	4. Choose OK.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
