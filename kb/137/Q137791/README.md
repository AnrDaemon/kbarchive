	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	Systems Management Server Admin does not display the correct BIOS date in the
	Personal Computer Properties windows for inventoried clients that use ATI Mach32
	PCI video adapters.
	
	To determine the correct date, run Windows NT Diagnostics (WINMSD.EXE) and choose
	Hardware.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	versions 1.0 and 1.1. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been
	regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft
	does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft
	Technical Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
