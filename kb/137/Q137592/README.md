	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you install Windows 95 on a computer with an Asus motherboard with an Intel
	Triton chip set, and the mouse is connected to the PS/2 mouse port on the
	computer, the mouse may stop responding and the keyboard may not work in MS-DOS
	sessions.
	
	Reconfiguring the mouse in Device Manager does not resolve the problem, and may
	cause the keyboard to stop responding, even in Safe mode.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The PS/2 mouse port is not configured correctly on the motherboard.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Reconfigure the PS/2 mouse port on the motherboard so that it is configured
	correctly. For information about how to do so, please consult the computer's
	documentation or manufacturer.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use a PS/2-style mouse on a computer with an Asus motherboard with an Intel
	Triton chip set, you must use a special PS/2-style mouse adapter. If the PS/2
	mouse port on the computer is not configured correctly, the port does not
	function properly in Windows 95.
