	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When you install Windows 95 from floppy disks for the first time, the Setup
	program writes the name and company that you enter on the User Information
	screen to Setup Disk 2. If the disk is write-protected, the following error
	message is displayed when Setup tries to write to the disk:
	
	  Cannot Write to Disk
	
	  Setup cannot write to the Windows 95 Setup disk. Make sure that the disk is
	  not write-protected and is properly inserted in the drive. Then click Retry.
	
	Once this information is written to Setup Disk 2, you can write-protect the
	entire set of disks if you want.
