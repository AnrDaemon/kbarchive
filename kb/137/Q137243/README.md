	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print from WordPad or Paint, the Number Of Copies option may be
	unavailable, preventing you from printing multiple copies of the current
	document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The printer that you are using does not support printing multiple copies.
	WordPad and Paint do not provide functionality for printing multiple copies;
	they rely on the printer driver to provide this functionality.
	
	If you use a printer driver that supports printing multiple copies, this
	functionality is available in WordPad and Paint.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To print multiple copies of a document, print each copy individually. To bypass
	the Print dialog box that appears each time you print a document, use the Print
	button on the toolbar rather than the Print command on the File menu.
