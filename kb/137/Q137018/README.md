	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	As of August, 1995, Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5
	with Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 3.5 installed achieved the C2 security rating
	from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Windows NT Workstation and Windows
	NT Server are now the first mainstream, GUI operating systems to successfully
	complete this security evaluation.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	As of September, 1995, customers who require C2 secure versions of Windows NT
	Workstation or Server version 3.5 can begin placing orders directly with
	Microsoft Inside Sales at (800) 426-9400.
	
	Successful completion of the C2 security evaluation means that Windows NT
	Workstation and Server version 3.5 have now been added to the Evaluated Products
	List (EPL) published by the National Security Agency. Even though the C2
	security class springs from the needs of US government installations, any
	organization concerned about security of business- sensitive data may have need
	of these security features.
	
	For additional information on the C2 Evaluation and Certification process, please
