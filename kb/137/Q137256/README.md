	================
	
	Preparing for the At Ease Setup
	-------------------------------
	
	On the computer that will act as the server:
	
	1. Insert the compact disc for the program you are installing and share the
	  disc.
	
	2. Open the hard drive, rename the folder that contains the program for that
	  disc, and then share the folder.
	
	  NOTE: The folders installed on the hard drive have the same name as the
	  compact disc. Two items with the same name cannot be shared on a computer
	  running the Mac OS. You may work around this problem by renaming the folder
	  on the hard drive. For example, rename Bookshelf 1996-97 to "MS Bookshelf
	  1996-97".
	
	On the computer where you want to run the program
	
	1. Open the Chooser and select the computer you shared the two items on, and
	  then select those two items to connect to them.
	
	2. An icon for the shared folder and the shared compact disc should appear on
	  the desktop.
	
	  The computer is now ready for At Ease Setup.
	
	Setting-up At Ease
	------------------
	
	1. Login as someone who has access to the Finder and has privileges to add
	  things anywhere on the hard drive.
	
	2. Open At Ease Setup.
	
	3. Select a User, and then click Open.
	
	4. In the Open User window, click Next.
	
	5. Click Add Applications.
	
	6. On the Disk pop-up menu, select the shared folder on the hard drive. For
	  example, Microsoft Dinosaurs.
	
	  Note: At Ease 3.0 automatically scans the Hard Drive for Applications. You do
	  not need to perform step 6. Continue with Step 7.
	
	7. Select the program from the list, click Add, and then click OK.
	
	8. Click Find Items.
	
	9. In the Disk menu, Select the shared compact disc. For example, select
	  Dinosaurs.
	
	10. In the Name Contains box, type the name of the compact disc. Again, for this
	  example, type "Dinosaurs" (without the quotation marks)
	
	11. On the list of the Items found on this disk, select the shared compact disc.
	
	12. Click Add. Click OK.
	
	13. To complete the user's settings, click Next.
	
	14. Click Done.
	
	15. Exit At Ease Setup. At Ease is configured to run the program.
	
	When you now start At Ease and log in, you should see two icons on the page. One
	icon allows you to connect to the shared CD-ROM, and the other starts the
	program. You need to connect to the CD-ROM before you start the program.
