	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to play sounds, some of the sounds, primarily national anthems,
	do not play. You may receive the following error message:
	
	  Could not open Multimedia window.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if the QuickTime version installed on the system is earlier
	than version 2.0.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To check the version of QuickTime, do the following:
	
	1. Open the System Folder.
	
	2. Open the Extensions Folder.
	
	3. Locate the QuickTime entry and click it.
	
	4. On the File menu, click Get Info.
	
	If the version number is earlier than 2.0, reinstall a newer version from the
	Encarta compact disc or from your Apple Macintosh compact disc. The Quicktime
	extension is located in the System Files folder which is in the Installer Files
	folder on the Encarta compact disk.
