	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Page 2 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP "Administrator's Guide" states
	that this gateway requires TCP/IP. The SMTP Gateway is functional with
	Microsoft TCP/IP version 1.0 (16-bit version only). This TCP/IP is only
	functional with either the Microsoft LAN Manager MS-DOS workstation or the
	Microsoft client workstation.
	
	The following locations of have the TCP/IP drivers and the workstation
	software:
	
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT 3.5 Server CD
	
	  CLIENTS\LANMAN\DISKS
	  CLIENTS\MSCLIENT\DISKS
	
	
	-or-
	
	- FTP.Microsoft.Com
	
	  BUSSYS\CLIENTS\LANMAN
	  BUSSYS\CLIENTS\MSCLIENT
	
	NOTE: The Windows version of TCP/IP is a 32-bit version; therefore, it is
	not supported with the SMTP Gateway.
