	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you select the United Kingdom (UK) keyboard Layout from Control Panel
	International, the right-hand ALT key (also known as the AltGr Key) will not
	work as expected. By selecting the UK keyboard layout you should be able to hold
	down the right-hand ALT key and select any vowel (a, e, i, o, and u) and the
	accent character (') should appear over the vowel you selected. For example,
	when you press Right ALT+A, [ASCII 225] should appear. Instead, no output
	appears.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
	problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
	version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
