	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Public folder names are not displayed in bold letters when there are unread
	messages in the public folders. This is contrary to the behavior of private
	folders that are displayed in bold letters when there are unread messages in
	them.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To be notified that a public folder contains unread messages, create a shortcut
	to that particular public folder. When the public folder contains unread
	messages, the shortcut to the public folder will then be displayed in bold
	letters.
	
	To update the public folders instead of just the shortcuts would be prohibitively
	uneconomical in terms of CPU and network bandwidth, as there could be thousands
	of public folders and this would have to be done for each user.
