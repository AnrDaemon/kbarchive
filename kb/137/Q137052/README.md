	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	During a PowerPoint slide show, you can press ALT+TAB to switch to an editing
	view of that slide show. If you change the interactive settings of an object in
	that slide show, those changes won't go into effect until you restart the slide
	show.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To allow your changes to take effect, you must stop the slide show and restart
	it. At that point your interactive settings will be correct.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 7.0 for
	Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
