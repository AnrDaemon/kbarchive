	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Windows NT version 3.51, Setup prompts you for a Product
	Identification Number. However, the Product Identification Number is not on the
	back cover of the Windows NT Workstation 3.51 "Installation Guide," where it
	should be located.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In a limited number of cases, the Product Identification Number was not printed
	on the cover of the Installation Guide.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Do not enter any number in the Product Identification Number dialog box, choose
	the OK button and continue Setup.
	
	NOTE: You do not need to enter a number in the Product Identification Number
	dialog box to complete Setup. Not entering this number does not affect the
	functionality of Windows NT.
