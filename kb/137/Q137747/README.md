	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to view a Microsoft Excel file that contains a chart with multiple
	data series, Quick View does not show multiple chart types reliably. Instead,
	Quick View either converts all the series to one type of chart, or shows the
	data in the correct type of chart, but the chart varies significantly from the
	actual graph.
	
	For example, if you create a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that contains two data
	series, and you then create a chart in which one series is represented by bars
	and the other series by an area graph, Quick View shows both series with bars.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
