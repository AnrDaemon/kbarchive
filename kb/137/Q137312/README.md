	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install HiJaak95 on your computer, you see only a blank white MSN
	Central window when you connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network. MSN Today appears
	(if it is set to open automatically), but none of the shortcuts work.

	=====
	
	There is a conflict between MSN and the HiJaak95 Find feature.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can run MSN if you disable the HiJaak95 Find feature. To disable the Find
	feature, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click HiJaak Catalog Setup.
	
	2. Click the Enable HiJaak Shell Extensions check box to clear it.
	
	3. Close HiJaak Catalog Setup.
	
	If you want to use the HiJaak95 Find feature when you are not using MSN, repeat
	the steps above. In step 2, click the Enable HiJaak Shell Extensions check box
	to select it.
