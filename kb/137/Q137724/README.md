	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
	- Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2b 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The attempt to replicate a file with a long file name from a Windows NT
	export directory to a FAT import directory on a LAN Manager server fails.
	NO_SYNC.RP$ appears on the LAN Manager import directory.
	
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5
	and 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
