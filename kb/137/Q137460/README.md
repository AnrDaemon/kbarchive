	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play a video in Bookshelf, you may experience the following behavior:
	
	  Approximately halfway through the video clip, the color lightens
	  considerably, and dark vertical lines appear across the picture.
	
	  -or-
	
	  The video scroll bar continues to move for several seconds after the video
	  ends.
	
	This behavior occurs with the .avi animation entitled 1989, Chinese Politburo
	member Hu Yaobang. The animation is part of the Human Rights and Social Justice,
	1989 article.
	
	This behavior may occur with other .avi files.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	The distortion occurs because the animation file is comprised of different video
	clips that are not necessarily from the same source. Because of variations in
	the original source video files, the distortion may occur.
	
	The scroll bar movement after the animation appears to have ended is due to the
	length of the video file (.avi). When the video movement stops, the end of the
	clip may not have been reached and the scroll bar continues to move giving the
	impression that a problem exists. The nature of this behavior is not a program
	problem.
