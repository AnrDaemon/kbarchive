	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The check printing feature of Quickbooks 3 for Windows does not print correctly
	on custom forms under Windows NT 3.5. When you try to print multiple checks it
	sends a form feed that causes the paper to advance past the custom forms
	printable areas. Quicken 3 for Windows only recognizes and uses the 8 1/2 x 11
	inch form.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If you define a custom form, you then need to set this form as the job default.
	But the default form setting is not being used or is being reset to 8 1/2 x 11.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This problem is still under investigation. The problem does not occur if you
	print reports with Quicken 3. Quicken 3 will not return any errors when the
	problem does occur.
