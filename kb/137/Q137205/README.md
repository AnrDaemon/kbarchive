	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When a Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0 user sends a recurring meeting
	request to a Schedule+ version 1.0 user, the appointment is booked as a
	single appointment.
	
	This is by product design. Schedule+ 1.0 does not allow users to invite
	others to a recurring meeting.
