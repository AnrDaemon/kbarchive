## Q137129: Automap: Gas Calculations are Incorrect

	Article: Q137129

	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Automap Road Atlas for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.02 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Automap Road Atlas miscalculates the fuel consumption for a journey.
	
	For example, if the fuel cost for all road types is set to $1.00 per gallon and
	miles per gallon (MPG) is set to 1, the cost calculation should yield $1.00 per
	mile. In this case, Road Atlas consistently over- estimates the cost by
	approximately 0.5 percent.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Automap versions 3.0 and 3.02.
	This problem was corrected in Automap version 3.03.
