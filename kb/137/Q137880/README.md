	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Julia Child Index and progress through several Index choices,
	if you click the Back option, you return to the initial Index opening window
	rather than your previous index choice.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This is by design. The Index and the associated Pop-ups are not part of the Back
	list. You are returned to the original Index window.
