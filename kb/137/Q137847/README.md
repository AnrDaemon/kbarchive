	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The number of shortcuts that can be displayed on the Start menu is limited by
	the screen resolution in use. If you add more shortcuts than can be displayed,
	the list of shortcuts is truncated. When this occurs, the shortcuts still exist
	in the Start Menu folder, and using a higher screen resolution will allow more
	of them to be displayed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Using a 1024 x 768 resolution, the limit is 34 items (including items such as
	Programs, Documents, and Settings). Using an 800 x 600 resolution, the limit is
	26 items. Using a 640 x 480 resolution, the limit is 21 items.
	
	To work around these limits, try one or more of the following methods:
	
	- Create a folder in the Start Menu folder, creating a cascading menu item.
	
	- Use Policy Editor to eliminate one or more of the default Start menu items.
	
	- Use a higher video resolution.
