	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open e-mail on MSN, The Microsoft Network, you are asked for the
	location of your postoffice.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You have Microsoft Mail installed in your Microsoft Exchange profile. E-mail on
	MSN does not use a postoffice.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you are not on a Local Area Network (LAN) that uses Microsoft Mail, Remove
	Microsoft Mail from your profile. To remove Microsoft Mail from a profile,
	follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Mail And Fax.
	
	3. In the "The following information services are set up in this profile" box,
	  click Microsoft Mail.
	
	4. Click Remove, and then click OK.
	
	If you are on a LAN that uses Microsoft Mail, do the following:
	
	Contact your system administrator for your postoffice location. You may also set
	up a separate profile for Microsoft Exchange that includes only the Microsoft
	Network Online Service in the Information Services for the profile and select
	that profile when logging into Microsoft Exchange.
