	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Xircom provides a modem script and support files for use with their PCMCIA CEM2
	CreditCard + Ethernet modem and Mail Remote for Windows.
	
	The script is available as XIRMDM.EXE from the Xircom forum on CompuServe (GO
	XIRCOM) and from the Xircom BBS (805) 376-9130.
	
	
	XIRMDM.EXE is a self-extracting archive that contains the following files:
	
	  XIRMDM   EXE        28,264  07-18-95  9:34a
