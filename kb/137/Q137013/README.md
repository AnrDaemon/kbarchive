	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Installing Windows 95 on older AMS computers with AMS motherboards (version C)
	and the following BIOS revisions causes the computer's BIOS to be overwritten:
	
	- 1.70
	
	- 1.90
	
	- 2.01
	
	The Windows 95 Setup process finishes correctly, but the computer fails to boot
	when you cycle the computer off and on and the computer runs its BIOS Power-On
	Self Test (POST).
	
	NOTE: AMS computers with AMS motherboards (version C) using the BIOS versions
	listed above are not on the Windows 95 Hardware Compatibility List and are not
	compatible with Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	AMS confirms that the motherboard and BIOS versions listed above are not
	compatible with Windows 95 and cause the BIOS to be overwritten. This causes the
	computer to fail to boot.
	
	Please contact AMS for information about products compatible with Windows 95, and
	about problems resulting from the installation of Windows 95.
