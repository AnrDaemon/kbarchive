	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following information is a copy of the information in the Readme.txt file in
	the Drivers\Display\Avance folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. Setup does not copy
	this file to your hard disk.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This driver does not automatically configure the display adapter's refresh rate
	according to the capabilities of the monitor to which it is attached. Instead,
	the refresh rate must be manually set. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. Copy the ASCAN.EXE utility into it's own subdirectory.
	
	2. Boot Windows 95 to a Command Prompt (restart the machine and hit F8 when the
	  "Starting Windows 95" message is displayed).
	
	3. Run the ASCAN utility from the DOS prompt.
	
	4. View the Help contents for information about modifying your autoexec.bat and
	  for monitor timing limitations.
	
	If you have any questions or problems, contact Avance Logic's Technical Support
	at 510-226-9555.
