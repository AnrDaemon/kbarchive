	XTree Gold for DOS slows down the overall system performance under Windows
	NT. For example, when you start XTree Gold for DOS, the processor
	utilization increased to 100 percent, causing other applications to run
	very slow.
	
	To correct this problem, run XTree Gold for DOS at a lower priority by
	starting it with the /LOW command. For example:
	
	  START /LOW XTGOLD.COM
