	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you build a slide that contains superscript or subscript text, the top or
	bottom of the characters may be cut off and may not be displayed properly in the
	slide show.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if superscript text is raised to the point that it overlaps
	the baseline of the text above it or if subscript text is lowered to the point
	that it overlaps the top of the characters of the text below it.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To allow the text to build properly in a slide show, adjust the line spacing in
	the text area. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Select the entire text area.
	
	2. On the Format menu, click Line Spacing.
	
	3. Adjust the line spacing and click OK. (You may need to experiment to achieve
	  a satisfactory setting.)
	
	  NOTE: If you want to see how the change will affect your slide, click Preview.
	  If the effect is what you want, click OK and readjust the line spacing by
	  repeating steps 1 through 3.
	
	The superscript or subscript text should now build as expected.
