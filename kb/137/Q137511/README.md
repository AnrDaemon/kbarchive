	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you download birthdays and anniversaries to the Timex DataLink watch, the
	data appears randomly. When you scroll through the dates in Anniversary mode,
	some dates are apparently skipped.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The anniversary and birthday lists are combined into a single list viewed in
	anniversary mode. The following sort criteria are used:
	
	- Current year birthday
	
	- Current year anniversary
	
	- Next birthday occurrence
	
	- Next anniversary occurrence
	
	With every viewing of the entire list, the date is incremented to the next year.
	
	NOTE: Currently, the Timex DataLink watch is only supported with the Windows 95
	client.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Timex Data Link watch is manufactured by Timex, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
