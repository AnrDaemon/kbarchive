	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When the sender of a Microsoft Exchange Schedule+ version 7.0 meeting request
	reads the acceptance message sent by another Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0
	user, the Yes: string common to Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.0 will not appear
	in the subject line.
	
	This is by product design.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.x included a Yes: string in the return message.
	This is not used by Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0. This version assigns a
	yes/no/maybe icon to the return message plus a matching yes/no/tentative line at
	the top of the returned invitation.
	
	Additional query words: 7.0
