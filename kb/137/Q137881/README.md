	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You are unable to copy or print information from online Help.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Help screens are in the form of DIBs (Device Independent Bitmaps). A .dib
	file format is designed to ensure that bitmap graphics created using one program
	can be loaded and displayed in another program exactly the way the image
	appeared in the originating program. Because of the DIB format, you are unable
	to copy or print Help text directly from the program.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, you can capture the information by pasting an image
	of the Help screen into Microsoft Paint (in Windows 95) or Paintbrush (in
	Windows 3.x). In Paint (or Paintbrush in Windows 3.x), the file becomes a bitmap
	(.bmp) and it can be cropped, sized, printed, or imported into other programs.
	Follow these steps to cut and paste the screen to Paint (or Paintbrush):
	
	1. To copy the active window containing the desired text, press ALT+PRINT SCREEN
	  on the keyboard.
	
	2. Open Microsoft Paint (or Paintbrush), normally located in the Accessories
	  group.
	
	3. On the Edit menu, click Paste.
	
	The picture can be saved and printed as a bitmap image (.bmp).
	
	NOTE: For information about the Copy and Paste commands, see your Windows printed
	documentation or online Help.
