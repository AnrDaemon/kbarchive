	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	If you customize the toolbar in the Systems Management Server Administrator
	window so that custom buttons use all spaces in the toolbar and you add another
	button, the button does not appear on the screen.
	
	This problem occurs whether the Systems Management Server Administrator window is
	set to restored or maximized size.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Systems Management Server Administrator is not able to start a second row of
	custom toolbar buttons and attempts to display the custom button outside the
	Systems Management Server Administrator window.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
