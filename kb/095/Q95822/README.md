	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some copied pronunciations from the Dictionary in Bookshelf may paste
	incorrectly into a document.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The copied text (pronunciation) is rendered as text in the Clipboard. When
	pasted into a word processor (for example, Word for Windows or Works for
	Windows) some characters appear as nonprintable characters instead of the
	symbols represented in Bookshelf.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	When you do the following, you expect phonetic characters; however, you receive
	different characters:
	
	1. Start the Dictionary.
	
	2. Select a word.
	
	3. From the Edit menu, select Copy.
	
	4. Note the pronunciations are not the same.
	
	5. Select the text.
	
	6. From the Edit menu, select Copy.
	
	7. Open a word processor.
	
	8. From the Edit menu, select Paste.
	
	Note: The Paste Special option in the Edit menu lists text as the only choice.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
