	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When using the Windows Sound System version 1.0 Voice Pilot, it is possible to
	temporarily turn off the microphone without closing Voice Pilot. While the Voice
	Pilot is active, press the CTRL+ALT keys to pause the microphone's input. If the
	Voice Pilot is minimized, the hash marks appearing around the microphone icon
	should disappear.
	
	To resume recording with the microphone, press the CTRL+ALT keys again and the
	hash marks will reappear. This key combination does not work for pausing and
	resuming microphone input within the Quick Recorder.
