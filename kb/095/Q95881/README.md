	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) machine or server name will be visible on a
	Windows for Workgroups network only when the Enable Sharing option is selected
	in the Network Settings dialog box (choose the Network icon in the Control Panel
	window).
	
	If the Enable Sharing option is not selected, other machines will not be able to
	view that machine on a browse list and the machine will not be able to see
	itself in a browse list. This situation applies to all Windows for Workgroups
	functions that display lists of Windows for Workgroups machines (such as Chat,
	Hearts, File Manager, Print Manager) and any application or utility that has a
	Network button.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This applies only to machines that have have the specifications to be Windows
	for Workgroups servers (that is, they can be run in 386 enhanced mode and have
	at least 3 megabytes [MB] of RAM). A 286 machine or a machine running in
	standard mode is not capable of sharing resources and the Enable Sharing option
	will be unavailable (dimmed).
