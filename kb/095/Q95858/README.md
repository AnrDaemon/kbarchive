	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	BUSETUP.EXE is the executable file for Bootable Upgrade Setup and is
	located on Setup Disk 1 of MS-DOS 6 Upgrade and MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade.
	
	Because Setup Disk 1 can be used to start your system and MS-DOS 6
	Upgrade and MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade are licensed as an upgrade package only,
	BUSETUP.EXE is designed to run only when your machine already has an
	operating system installed.
	
	When you start your computer from MS-DOS 6 Upgrade or MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade
	Setup Disk 1, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file runs BUSETUP.EXE.
