## Q95880: Banyan VINES Pop-Up Application Does Not Function with WFWG

	Article: Q95880
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.1
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 05-NOV-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Windows-based Banyan VINES Pop-Up application MESSAGES.EXE does not work
	correctly with Windows for Workgroups.
	
	The Banyan VINES network operating system versions 4.11 and higher provides a
	message service that can send and receive messages from within Windows using the
	MESSAGES.EXE program. When you use Windows for Workgroups with the VINES
	connectivity drivers, you hear a sound when a message is received but the
	MESSAGES.EXE program continues to show that no messages have been received.
	
	NOTE: This problem may also affect other messenger-based VINES applications.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To view the messages, use the MS-DOS-based LASTMSG.EXE program, which correctly
	shows all messages received since you logged in.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Banyan Systems has confirmed this to be a problem with its Windows for
	Workgroups drivers and can be contacted for further information.
	
	Banyan VINES is manufactured by Banyan Systems, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
