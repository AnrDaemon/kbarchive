	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Windows Sound System ProofReader feature allows information in a
	spreadsheet to be read back in a human voice through the sound card. You can
	access ProofReader with a special Proof menu created by Windows Sound System. In
	version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for Windows, this menu is always available. In
	version 3.0 of Microsoft Excel for Windows, this menu is available only if you
	choose the Full Menus command.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Excel 3.0 provides the option to use short menus or full menus. If you
	choose the Short Menus command, the Proof menu for Windows Sound System does not
	appear. If the Proof menu is not showing on the menu bar, choose Full Menus from
	the Options menu.
	
	If the Proof menu still does not appear after you choose Full Menus, the
	ProofReader option has not been installed correctly in Microsoft Excel 3.0. To
	correct this problem, run the Microsoft Windows Sound System setup program and
	install the ProofReader option.
