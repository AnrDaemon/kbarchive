	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can align lower-level bullets with the left margin of text formatted for the
	previous indentation level. This article describes how to do this because this
	procedure is not documented in Microsoft PowerPoint Help.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To align bullets with the left edge of previous levels of text, like this
	example
	
	  Indentation level 1 text
	  *   Indentation level 2 text (asterisks represent bullets)
	      *   Indentation level 3 text
	
	follow these steps:
	
	1. Select the text box that contains the indented text.
	
	2. On the View menu, click Ruler.
	
	  This displays the indent markers for all indent levels.
	
	3. Press the CONTROL key and click the top triangle of the level whose bullet
	  you want to align with the text above.
	
	4. Hold down the CONTROL key and drag the triangle until it aligns with the
	  bottom triangle of the previous indentation level.
	
	Your bullets should now line up with text formatted for the previous level of
	indentation.
	
	For each indent marker, the top triangle controls the first line of text indented
	to that level. The bottom triangle controls all subsequent lines of text
	indented to that level.
