	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you draw a line with an arrowhead and then scale the line down, the line is
	reduced in length but the arrowhead stays the same size.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To change the size of the arrowhead, change the width of the line. When you
	choose a lighter or heavier line style, the arrowhead size adjusts accordingly.
	
	However, if you want to change the proportions of the arrowhead, or if you want
	to reduce or enlarge the arrow, use the following workaround:
	
	1. Select the arrow you want to reduce.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Cut.
	
	3. On the Edit menu, click Paste Special.
	
	4. The Paste dialog box appears. Click Picture and then click Paste.
	
	The arrow appears in a box as a picture. You can now scale it up or down by
	dragging inward or outward on the corners of the box.
	
	This workaround converts the arrowhead from an object to a picture. You will no
	longer be able to rotate the line, change the line style, or remove or add
	arrowheads.
