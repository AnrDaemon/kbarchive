	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The courses used in Golf are taken from video tapes that are digitized into the
	computer. Golf allows you to choose the level and tee to play at after selecting
	a course. However, not all of the championship courses taped have black tees. If
	you choose black tees and the course does not have them, Golf will automatically
	start players at the tee farthest from the green (the blue or gold tees). Blue,
	black, and gold represent the professionals' tees.
