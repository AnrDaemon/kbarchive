	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Calibrate button in the joystick control options for Monster Truck Madness
	does not work when using the Windows NT 4.0 operating system.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Windows NT 4.0 does not have the same type of joystick support as Windows 95. As
	a result, the Calibrate button in Monster Truck Madness does not perform any
	action. To get your joystick to work in Monster Truck Madness, you must open the
	Joystick Control Panel in Windows NT and calibrate your joystick. To do this, do
	the following:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the Joystick icon.
	
	3. From the Joystick Selection dialog box, select your joystick and click
	  Calibrate.
	
	4. Proceed through the prompts and click OK. The joystick should now be
	  calibrated and work in Monster Truck Madness.
