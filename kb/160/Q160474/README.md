	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the Send Fax Now button on the Fax Wizard toolbar, you receive
	the following message after the Wizard starts faxing your document:
	
	  The wizard has finished sending your document.

	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To complete the fax process, send the fax using your fax program.
	
	For additional information, refer to your fax program documentation.
	
	
	STATUS
