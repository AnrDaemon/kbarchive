	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In FrontPage Explorer, when you attempt to cancel the operation of renaming a
	folder or a file by clicking the Cancel button, the cancel operation may not be
	successful.
	
	When you refresh the Web, you may find that the file or folder name was changed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	FrontPage ignores the Cancel operation. However, when you click Cancel after you
	delete or rename a file, the screen is not updated.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you click Cancel while renaming a folder, refresh the Web by clicking Refresh
	on the View menu to ensure that you are accurately seeing the state of the Web.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
