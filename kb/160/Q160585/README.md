	When you attempt to start Encarta or when you attempt to use the Bookshelf Guide

	  One or more files required for Apple Guide are missing. Help will not be
	  available. To correct this problem, reinstall from <CD-ROM volume
	  label>
	
	where <CD-ROM volume label> refers to Encarta 97 Disc 1 or the Bookshelf
	1996-97 CD
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This error occurs if Apple Guide is disabled or missing from the Extensions
	folder.

	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, do the following:
	
	1. On the Apple menu, select Control Panels.
	
	2. Open the Extensions Manager (or third-party utility that manages extensions).
	
	3. Select Apple Guide.
	
	4. Close the Extensions Manager.
	
	5. On the Special menu, select Restart.
	
	If the problem persists, try to following steps:
	
	1. If the Apple Guide system extension is not on the machine, open the
	  installation program on the program compact disc (for example, double- click
	  the "Install Encarta 97" icon on the Encarta 97 Disc 1 CD-ROM).
	
	2. On the Easy Install drop-down menu, select Custom Install.
	
	3. Scroll through the list of components and select the box that corresponds to

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Extensions Manager control panel is not included with Mac OS 7.1. You may
	need to reinstall the Apple Guide components that correspond to your version of
	the Mac OS.
	
	You may be using a third-party utility for managing extensions on your Macintosh
	rather than Extensions Manager. You may need to consult the documentation for
	that product for instructions on managing extensions.
