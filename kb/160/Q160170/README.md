	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play a video clip, you may experience one or more of the following
	symptoms:
	
	- The system may stop responding (hang).
	
	- The video may flash.
	
	- Distortion is observed in the video playback area.
	
	- The video may just show a blank window, a white window, or a black window,
	  even though the sound plays correctly.
	
	- Some systems may experience hesitation problems with the video, where it
	  continually starts and stops instead of playing smoothly.
	
	- Videos only play in the large or expanded mode. The normal mode videos do not
	  play.
