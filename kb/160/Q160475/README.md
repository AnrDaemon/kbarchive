	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you download a clip from the Design Gallery Live site on the World Wide Web,
	it is downloaded as a .cil (Clip Gallery Package) file. This article explains
	how to use these files.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you have Internet access, you can connect to a special site on the World Wide
	Web directly from Microsoft Clip Gallery. This site contains additional clip art
	that you can download.
	
	Here's what happens when you select a piece of clip art to download:
	
	- Your Web browser copies a file to your Internet cache directory. This file
	  has a .cil extension.
	
	- Your Web browser runs the .cil file. This expands the clip art file and
	  copies it to the following folder:
	
	  C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry\Downloaded Clips
	
	- Clip Gallery registers the new clip and adds the information about the clip
	  to your primary .cag file.
	
	NOTE: If you have Microsoft Clip Gallery, you can run a .cil file by
	double-clicking it in Windows Explorer. If you think you have downloaded a new
	clip but cannot find it in Clip Gallery, search for files with a .cil extension,
	and then run the appropriate file by double-clicking it.
