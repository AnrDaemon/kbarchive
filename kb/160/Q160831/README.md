	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
	- Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the FrontPage Frames wizard is finished, it returns to FrontPage Editor
	without indicating that the steps in the wizard have been completed
	successfully.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage
	98 for Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you use a template, the wizard will create the frameset page and all
	corresponding pages for the frame document. If you make a custom grid without
	specifying the location of the component pages, the frameset page is created
	with broken links to the component pages. Creating pages in the location
	referred to by the frame set will correct the broken links.
