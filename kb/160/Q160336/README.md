	- The Microsoft Network versions 2.0, 2.5 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use a shortcut that you created to a frame in a show on MSN, The
	Microsoft Network, the shortcut may open Microsoft Internet Explorer instead of
	Program Viewer. You may see the information to which you created the shortcut,
	but the information may not be formatted correctly. You may also receive a
	VBScript Runtime error message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you use the right mouse button to click in a frame and create a shortcut,
	you are pointing at a subframe. This means that when you use the shortcut, it
	loads from that subframe and may not load everything needed to correctly display
	the information.
