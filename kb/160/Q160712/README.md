	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run a multimedia program that uses CD Audio, such as Magic School Bus
	Explores the Earth, you may receive an error message similar to the following:
	
	  CdAudio Error 26 MMsystem282
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem may occur if you have specified the wrong CD-ROM drive in the CD
	Music section of the Multimedia settings in Control Panel.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, do the following:
	
	1. Click the Start button, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. In Control Panel, double-click Multimedia.
	
	3. Click the CD Music tab.
	
	4. In the CD-ROM Drive box, enter the appropriate drive letter, and click OK.
	
	5. Start the program.
	
	At this point the CD Audio error should not appear, and CD Audio should play
	correctly from the program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The symptoms described above may occur if a CD-ROM changer (multiple CD-ROM
	drive) is being used on the computer, where each drive is assigned a different
	drive letter. Because Windows assigns a specific drive letter to be used for
	playing audio compact discs, this problem may occur.
