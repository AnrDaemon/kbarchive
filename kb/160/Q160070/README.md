	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 supports the Unicode character set. As a result of this new
	functionality, the Symbol dialog box in Word 97 has the following
	characteristics:
	
	- International fonts do not appear in the Font list in Word. The international
	  font sets previously available included the following:
	
	  Arial CE
	  Arial Cyr
	  Arial Greek
	  Courier New CE
	  Courier New Cyr
	  Courier Greek
	  Times New Roman CE
	  Times New Roman Cyr
	  Times New Roman Greek
	
	  Although these fonts are installed on your computer, Word does not make them
	  available for use.

	  Knowledge Base:

	- Fonts are separated into different subsets. The subset list is unavailable if
	  the currently selected font does not contain subcategories.
	
	  NOTE: Symbol fonts do not contain subcategories.
	
	  Subsets that may be available include the following:
	
	  Alphabetic Presentation Forms
	  Arrows
	  Basic Greek
	  Basic Latin
	  Block Elements
	  Box Drawing
	  Currency Symbols
	  Cyrillic
	  General Punctuation
	  Geometric Shapes
	  Latin Extended Additional
	  Latin Extended-A
	  Latin Extended-B
	  Latin-1
	  Letterlike Symbols
	  Mathematical Operators
	  Miscellaneous Dingbats
	  Miscellaneous Technical
	  Number Forms
	  Private Use Area
	  Spacing Modifier Letters
	  Superscripts and Subscripts
	
	  NOTE: The Symbol character map expands based on the font selected. You can
	  scroll through the list of displayed characters or by selecting a subset.
	  When you do this, the selection will jump to the start of the subset.
	
	  To make the Subset list available, do the following:
	
	  1. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.
	
	  2. In the Symbol dialog box, select (normal text) in the Font list.
	
	     The Subset list appears to the right of the Font list.
