	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you perform a find and replace while the Office Assistant is running, the
	balloon message that informs you of how many replacements were made does not
	include an OK or a Close button. The Cancel button in the Find and Replace
	dialog box does not change to Close while the balloon message is displayed.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem so that the Cancel button in the Find and Replace
	dialog box changes to Close, use one of the following methods:
	
	Method 1: Click the Find and Replace dialog box.
	
	Method 2: Press any key.
	
	Method 3: Click the balloon message.
	
	The balloon message is closed, the focus is returned to the Find and Replace
	dialog box, and the Cancel button changes to Close.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A balloon message is an interactive message that requires you to confirm or
	cancel an action before you can close it. The balloon message that appears after
	you complete a find and replace operation does not include an OK or a Close
	button. If you click the Office Assistant while the balloon message is visible,
	the Office Assistant prompts you for a Help topic. If you click in the document
	while the balloon message is visible, you get a system beep.
