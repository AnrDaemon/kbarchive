{% raw %}

	Article: Q160054
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): WinNT:4.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use File Manager in Windows NT 4.0 to connect to a Novell NetWare
	volume, you cannot browse further than the volume level. For example, if you
	double-click a volume, File Manager maps a drive to that volume rather than
	opening a view of that volume. File Manager in Windows NT 3.51 displays a list
	of folders beneath the volume when you double-click the volume.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use Windows NT Explorer to work around this problem in Windows NT 4.0.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
