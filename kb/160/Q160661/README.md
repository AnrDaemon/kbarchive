	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you run the Japanese Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client on a computer that
	is not running Japanese Windows 95, Japanese characters are not displayed
	properly. Japanese Microsoft Exchange clients use a double- byte character set
	(DBCS), which is not completely supported by non- Japanese versions of Windows
	95.
