	- Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
	- Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Encarta Encyclopedia can not automatically open America Online's "AOL 3.0 for
	Windows" Web browser, in order to download Yearbook Updates. This article
	discusses how to manually download the updates.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The AOL Web browser included with "AOL for Windows 3.0" is not a standalone,
	separate Web browser. This AOL browser is an internal component inside the main
	AOL program, so there is no way for Encarta 97 to open it.
	
	To manually download the Yearbook Updates, follow these steps:
	
	1. Exit Encarta.
	
	2. Connect to AOL and sign on.
	
	3. Click Internet, and manually type the Encarta web address into your browser.
	  The web address is:
	
	  http://encarta.msn.com/downloads/download.asp
	
	4. Click "Encarta 97 Encyclopedia", and then click the month you want to
	  download.
	
	5. When the Save As window appears, click OK. It does not matter which folder it
	  is saved to.
	
	  NOTE: If you have more than one hard drive or partition, save the update file
	  to the SAME hard drive that Encarta is on.
	
	6. The download is finished when the AOL icon stops spinning and the progress
	  bar reaches full and then resets. When the download is finished, exit AOL (if
	  desired).
	
	  NOTE: You can click AOL's Back button to return to the Downloads page.
	
	7. Start Encarta. On the Contents page, click Online Features.
	
	8. Click Yearbook, then click Downloads, and then click Integrate.
	
	9. If you get an message asking to search the hard drive, click OK.
	
	  Your Encarta Updates are integrated into Encarta Encyclopedia.
	
	Viewing Updates
	---------------
	
	To view the updates after integrating, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click the Back (triangle) button at the top of the Downloads window (next the
	  X button).
	
	2. Click the Directory button. The Updates articles are listed here.
	
	Using Other Web browsers with AOL
	---------------------------------
	
	To enable Encarta to activate your Web browser and automatically open the Encarta
	Downloads Web site, you need a standalone Web browser.
	
	You can install "AOL 3.0 for Windows 95", which includes Internet Explorer
	version 3.01. See the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q162744 Using AOL's Internet Connection With Windows 95 Applications
	
	If you have Windows 3.1, you can use AOL's Internet connection in conjunction
	with a standalone Web browser like Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet
	Explorer (IE). NOTE: Internet Explorer is included with Encarta 97. For more
	information, see the following article in the Microsoft Base Knowledge:
