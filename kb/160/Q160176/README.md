	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you change the system date in Control Panel Date/Time it may cause a Stop
	0A error. This happens when you use the Madge ATM Multiplexor network adapter in
	a computer running Windows NT. Note that on some computers this will happen
	immediately, on others it may take some time. This may also happen when
	performing certain functions under Microsoft SQL Server such as checkdb.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This stop code can be generated by outdated drivers for the Madge ATM
	Multiplexor network adapter.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Please contact Madge for information and assistance regarding Madge Drivers.
