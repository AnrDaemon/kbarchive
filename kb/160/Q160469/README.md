	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When Systems Management Server inventories a system running OS/2, it will not
	report the presence of a Pentium processor. It will correctly report 286, 386,
	and 486 processors.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. A supported fix is now available, but has not been
	fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
	specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
	Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
	fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
