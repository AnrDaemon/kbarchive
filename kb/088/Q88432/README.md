	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following STB (Simply The Best) video cards run with Microsoft Windows:
	
	Card                   Notes
	----                   -----
	
	Powergraph VGA         Has a driver to support 1024 x 768 with 256
	                      colors; this card needs at least 1 MB of
	                      memory to support this video mode
	
	Auto VGA               Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA
	
	VGA Extra Em           Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA
	
	VGA EM-16              Uses a Microsoft driver for standard VGA; only
	                      runs in standard mode unless BIOS is 1.33
	                      or greater
	
	640 VGA and VGA 80/16  May require a BIOS upgrade from STB if the
	                      BIOS version is 1.78 or earlier
	
	If you use these cards while running in 386 enhanced mode of Windows operating
	system version 3.1, and you are experiencing erratic mouse behavior after
	exiting from the MS-DOS Prompt, you may need to update your STB Systems video
	drivers. Video driver incompatibility may also terminate Windows and return you
	to the MS-DOS command prompt.
	
	STB video cards are manufactured by STB, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these cards' performance or
	reliability.
