	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains a list of documents available from Microsoft that discuss
	TrueType fonts with reference to their use in Microsoft Windows operating system
	version 3.1.
	
	\ The documents are broadly classified into three categories on the basis of
	their technical scope. Documents in the "End User" category have information
	about using TrueType fonts for the Windows 3.1 end user. Documents in the
	"Application Developer" category discuss the impact of TrueType fonts on
	Windows-based applications and contain technical details that let application
	developers use, and take advantage of, TrueType font technology in their
	applications. Documents in the "Font/Tool/Curious Developer" category contain
	information useful to developers interested in developing their own TrueType
	fonts or font-development tools, or interested in knowing about the inner
	workings of the TrueType font technology.
	
	Each entry contains information to help the reader obtain a copy of the document.
	Many of the following documents will be available as part of the upcoming
	Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) CD. For more information about this CD, call
	the Microsoft Developer Services Team at (800) 227-4679.

	What to expect: This document contains a gentle introduction to using fonts in
	applications. It begins with a discussion of the fundamentals of fonts,
	introduces the three font technologies used in Windows 3.1 (with an emphasis on
	TrueType fonts), discusses TrueType font technology in the context of WYSIWYG

	typical computer system goes through in order to display characters on the
	output device and details these steps for TrueType fonts in Windows 3.1.
	
	Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.
	
	Title: "Linear vs. Nonlinear Scaling" Author: George Moore
	
	What to expect: This transcript of a technical talk describes the importance of
	being able to nonlinearly scale a font. It discusses how a TrueType font vendor
	can use nonlinear scaling so that low-resolution devices can display
	high-quality TrueType fonts.
	
	Finding a copy: This document is available in the Microsoft Software Library as
	document S13452.
