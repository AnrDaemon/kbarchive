	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Bondwell 3210 Plus
	------------------
	
	If the 3210 Plus is not set up for CGA, Setup stops when disk 2 is inserted. The
	detection part of Setup incorrectly thinks the screen is VGA.
	
	Bondwell B310
	-------------
	
	Windows Setup may detect an incorrect keyboard on a Bondwell B310 laptop.
	According to Bondwell, the correct choice should be 101- or 102-key keyboard. If
	another keyboard choice is selected, then Setup may fail or some standard
	keyboard operations may not work properly. The Bondwell B310 Laptop has an
	84-key keyboard.
