	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Golf for Windows version 1.0, the Aiming Marker Pole hangs up at
	different locations in the Main View window when you move it around with the
	mouse. The problem is more pronounced when the Aim Shot command is chosen from
	the Action menu with the keyboard. This is caused when the Aiming Marker pole
	gets into a ravine or other steep slope on the fairway. Try moving the Aiming
	Marker left or right to get around this obstacle.
