	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you run Golf under Microsoft Windows version 3.0, the mouse cursor is an
	arrow instead of an hourglass during the initial startup of the program. In
	Windows 3.1, the cursor remains an hourglass until the program is fully loaded
	and the Welcome dialog box is opened. The startup program MSGOLF.EXE has control
	for only a split second before Windows starts to load GLFMOD2.EXE. Windows
	decides what the cursor should look like during this period.
