	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	According to Logitech technical support, the Logitech Dexxa two-button and
	three-button mice are compatible with Microsoft Windows, and should be set up as
	"Microsoft or IBM PS/2 Mouse."
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The three-button mouse has a switch on the bottom that must be set to Microsoft
	Mouse emulation.
	
	Logitech, which handles distribution and support for the Dexxa mice, claims that
	this model has been discontinued and is highly system dependent. If the
	suggested solution does not work, call Logitech technical support.
	
	The Logitech products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
	performance or reliability.
