	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Golf for Windows is optimized to run on a 256-color video card and
	driver. As a result, when you run Golf with a 16-color video driver, total
	performance will be slower because Golf has to dither the colors that make up
	the main and top view. For better performance, upgrade your video card and
	driver to support 256 colors.
