	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The import utility, IMPORT.EXE, allows Microsoft Mail administrators to import
	external postoffice addresses and gateway addresses from a text file directly
	into their postoffice's address lists (for example, postoffice address lists and
	gateway address lists).
	
	This text file is normally created either from a foreign mail system or by
	extracting address lists from another postoffice. You can also use the import
	utility to extract address lists from other postoffices.
	
	For more information on this utility, see Appendix D of the "Microsoft Mail
	Administrator's Guide."
