	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When creating a player in Microsoft Golf for Windows, if you are using the
	keyboard, the gender is selected automatically.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Launch Microsoft Golf.
	
	2. Choose the Start New Game button.
	
	3. In the New Game dialog box, choose the Create Player button.
	
	4. In the Name Player dialog box, type a name and choose the OK button.
	
	5. In the Create Player dialog box, without selecting gender, press ENTER.
	
	6. Error dialog box appears saying you must select a gender.
	
	7. Press ENTER.
	
	8. Female Gender is chosen for you.
	
	Note: This does not happen if you choose OK with the mouse. It also does not
	happen from the Player:Player Settings dialog box. This occurs because the focus
	is set to the "female" button when you return from this alert dialog box.
