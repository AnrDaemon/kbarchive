## Q88514: Swing Stalls When Sounds Play in Golf

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Your swing may stall when playing Microsoft Golf for Windows. This typically
	occurs if you are using a nonmultimedia driver. If there is not enough memory,
	or your machine is slow (80286/12 MHz or less), the sound causes Microsoft Golf
	to stop temporarily.
	
	To test whether this is the source of your problem, turn off the sound effects by
	choosing Sound from the Options menu and clearing the check boxes before
	starting a round. If Microsoft Golf runs more smoothly, you'll know that the
	sound effects are causing the problem. The virtual real sound driver shipped
	with Golf and some earlier Windows 3.0 drivers may also cause this problem. Make
	sure you have the latest version of the sound driver. For information about the
	most recent sound driver for your system, contact your sound card manufacturer.
