	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to view an attachment in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for
	Windows, the following error may occur:
	
	  The application for the attached file <filename> (or one of its
	  components) could not be found.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To associate the attached file with the originating application, use the
	Association command on the Windows File Manager File menu. The Associate command
	assigns and associates a specific file extension to a particular application. If
	there is no extension or no copy of the originating application, there can be no
	association.
	
	To Associate a File
	-------------------
	
	1. From the File Manager File menu, choose Associate.
	
	2. Specify the file extension in the File With Extension: box.
	
	3. Specify the application in the Associate With: box. You can use the Browse
	  feature to quickly find the application's executable file.
