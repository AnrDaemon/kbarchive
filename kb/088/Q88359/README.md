	Varityper technical support has confirmed that the Varityper VT-600 driver
	included with Windows 3.1 does not support some VT-600P printer resident
	fonts. The only printer resident fonts available when using this driver are
	Courier and Times Roman.
	
	Varityper has a new driver available for the VT-600P that recognizes
	all of the printer resident fonts. This driver can be obtained by
	contacting Varityper technical support at (800) 526-0767.
	
	According to Varityper technical support, you can workaround this
	problem by configuring your VT-600P to emulate an Apple LaserWriter II
	NT, and install the LaserWriter II NT printer driver.
	
	The VT-600P is manufactured by Varityper, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
	product's performance or reliability.
