	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Sound Master II, manufactured by Covox Tympanum Corporation, emulates an Adlib
	Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) card. Windows 3.1 digitized sound
	drivers for the Sound Master II card are available through the Covox BBS numbers
	listed below.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Although the Sound Master II is compatible with the Adlib MIDI card, the MIDI
	port on the card needs specific Covox drivers for MIDI support under Windows
	3.1. Covox is currently developing these drivers and they will be available on
	the Covox BBS when they are completed.
	
	The Covox BBS also includes an updated Wave form audio driver dated July 10,
	1992. If you have a Covox sound device and use Windows 3.1, Covox recommends
	obtaining the newest wave form driver.
	
	For additional information, contact Covox technical support or download the file
	WINHELP.TXT (from the Covox BBS), which provides information on installing Covox
	drivers for Windows 3.1.
	
	The products included here, Sound Master II and Adlib MIDI card, are manufactured
	by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
	regarding these products' performance or reliability.
