	- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
	   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
	   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) provide a CFileException class. The
	CFileException class includes public data members that contain operating- system
	errors and C Run-time errors that may be generated by certain file operations.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The CFile and CStdioFile classes may throw a CFileException when certain error
	conditions occur; however, these classes do not throw a CFileException when the
	end of file is reached. If an application using the CFile or CStdioFile class
	needs to check for the end-of-file condition when reading from a file, the
	return values from the Read() and ReadString() member functions should be
	checked.
	
	CFile::Read returns the actual number of bytes read. If this number is less than
	the bytes requested, then the end of file has been reached.
	
	CStdioFile::ReadString returns a NULL pointer when the end of file has been
	reached.
