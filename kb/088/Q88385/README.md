	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Word for Windows generates the following error message when you start
	Word if the Word and Bookshelf CD is not in the CD-ROM drive:
	
	  Word cannot use the Tools-Path specified in the WIN.INI file because it is
	  invalid.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To prevent the error message from reoccurring, make sure that the proper CD is
	in the CD-ROM drive prior to starting Word for Windows. The Tools-Path= section
	sets alternative locations for proofing tools, file converters, graphic filters,
	autosave files, and user dictionaries.
	
	This error will also occur if the CD-ROM drive cannot detect a new CD-ROM disk in
	the drive (for example, the Bookshelf 1993 Upgrade Setup). To correct this
	problem, Run File Manager and access the CD-ROM drive before starting Word.
