	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Golf for Windows version 1.0, the distance in the Total field and
	the distance in the To Pin field in the Post Shot dialog do not add up to the
	original distance to pin from tee. The error on these figures is from 3 to 6
	yards. The expected error due to rounding should be only 1 yard. Unless you hit
	the ball straight at the pin, the numbers will not add up.
