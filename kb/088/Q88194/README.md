	========
	
	According to Syquest technical support, its SYDOS removable hard drives do not
	allow Microsoft Windows version 3.1 to create either temporary or permanent swap
	files on the drives. The drive letter(s) for the SYDOS drives are not available
	in the Virtual Memory dialog box.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you have a standard non-removable hard drive in addition to the SYDOS drive,
	you can create a swap file on that hard drive.
