	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Changing the stance in Advanced Shot Setup doesn't affect a ball's flight when
	it's hit. In real golf, you adjust your stance to change your swing plane and
	club face. Because you have explicit control over these in Golf, there is no
	need to change stance. We allow stance to be changed to allow people to mimic
	their own styles and because it looks more accurate to have the stance set along
	with the swing plane/club face.
