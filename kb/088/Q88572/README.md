	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	According to Intel technical support, the Intel Inboard 386/PC does not run
	Microsoft Windows version 3.1. The Inboard 386/PC was designed for IBM XT class
	machines based on the 8088 or 8086 processors.
	
	There is no workaround to this problem.
	
	There is an entry in the Windows 3.1 Compatibility List for the IBM AT/Inboard
	386 AT. This is a different product that upgrades the IBM AT (80286 processor)
