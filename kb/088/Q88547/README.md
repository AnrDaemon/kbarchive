	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Tandy technical support has confirmed that you may see white spots on your
	display when you use Microsoft Windows 3.1 on a Tandy 4825SX and a 4850EP after
	you have upgraded the video memory.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by an incompatibility between some of the motherboards
	and the Intel 70 nanosecond video RAM chips. If, after upgrading the video
	memory, you see white dots on the screen in Windows 3.1, then look at the main
	logic board next to the CMOS battery. If the word "WAVE" and a up arrow are
	stamped on the motherboard, then the problem is probably with the video RAM
	upgrade chips. The video RAM chips that produce the error are Intel 70
	nanosecond chips.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	These Intel 70 nanosecond chips should be replaced with either Intel 60
	nanosecond or Micron 70 nanosecond chips.
	
	To correct this problem, contact Tandy technical support for replacement video
	RAM chips.
