	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When running Microsoft Windows operating system on a computer using an early
	model AST RAMpage memory board, you may experience disappearing mouse pointers
	and incorrect keyboard input.
	
	According to AST technical support, you should be using version 6.1 or later of
	the AST RAMpage board when running Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Additional things to check on the RAMpage board:
	
	1. Look at the soldered side of the board and find a printed circuit board part
	  number ending with -302C or -302D.
	
	2. If the part number ends in -302D or higher, you have a good board.
	
	3. If the part number ends in -302C and there is a wire jumper running along the
	  back of the board, you have a good board.
	
	4. If you have a -302C board without a jumper, you must have your board
	  upgraded.
	
	5. If you have a board earlier than -302C, it will probably not work correctly
	  and should be upgraded.
