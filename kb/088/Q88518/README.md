	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the golf course by Access Software called Barton Creek-Fazio, there is an
	extremely steep trough located near holes 12 and 13.
	
	When you are located in this steep trough, the screen may appear unusual due to
	the steep incline. You can hit out of it, usually by hitting with a straight
	loftwedge or sandwedge. You may experience difficulty getting out of the trough
	if using the Chip feature as your shot type. Therefore, it is recommended that
	you use the Straight shot type using a sandwedge or loftwedge.
	
	This course is designed according to the actual Barton Creek-Fazio course in
	Barton Creek, Texas, the site of the Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf Tournament.
