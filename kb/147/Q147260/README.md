	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a message or note from the Microsoft Exchange client by using the
	Print icon on the toolbar, the output may not go to the default printer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The print output will go to the last printer selected (or currently selected) in
	the Print option on the File menu.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	When you change the printer selection with the Print option, the selection is
	maintained until it is either changed or the client is restarted. The printer
	selection is reset back to the default printer (selected in the operating
	systems printers Control Panel) when you restart the client.
