	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open the Microsoft Exchange Profile dialog window, you can not close it
	by pressing the Escape (ESC) key. You must closed it by selecting the Close
	button, or by using the control box in the upper-right hand corner of the dialog
	window.
	
	NOTE: The ESC key does successfully work in other sections of the Microsoft
	Exchange Mail and Fax applet.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Because this window is not a child window of an application, this behavior is by
	design.
	
	
	Additional query words: Escape cancel exchange
