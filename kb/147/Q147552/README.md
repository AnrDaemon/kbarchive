	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you set the time in Windows NT to use twenty-four hour time, Windows NT
	Backup appends an incorrect PM setting to the operation in the Backup.log file.
	Twenty-four hour time does not require AM or PM settings and should not be
	applied to any events that use this time measurement.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
	problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
	version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
