	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, versions 5.0, 5.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator, you may receive vague and cryptic error messages. These
	error messages are usually in a numeric format such as the following:
	
	  xx/+xxxxx
	
	Where xx/+xxxxx is a series of digits such as 039/+00901.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	These error messages usually indicate that a third party-scenery package has
	been to the Flight Simulator installation.
	
	In Flight Simulator version 5.1, the following error messages:
	
	  039/+00901
	
	  -or-
	
	  O39/+00939
	
	indicate an issue with the BAO product Flight Simulator Flight Shop (FSFS). There
	is no Microsoft or Flight Simulator fix available. Please contact the BAO
	technical support number listed in your FSFS manual.
	
	Most error messages in the format described at the top of this article indicate a
	problem with FSFS and Flight Simulator 5.0, or with Flight Simulator and
	third-party scenery such as Hong Kong or Budapest.
	
	These scenery packages are not sanctioned by Microsoft and do not work
	consistently in Flight Simulator 5.1 or Flight Simulator 5.0.
	
	To solve these error messages, you need to reinstall Flight Simulator or contact
	the scenery manufacturer.
	
	
	In Flight Simulator version 5.0, the error message
	
	  039/+00901
	
	  -or-
	
	  039/+00939
	
	was common to users with Pentium-equipped computers. To resolve this error
	message, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
