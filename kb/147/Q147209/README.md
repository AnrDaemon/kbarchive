	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot change the default font for received mail messaged in Microsoft
	Exchange. If both mail clients support Rich Text Format (RTF), received messages
	are displayed using the font with which they were created.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There is no option to change the default font for received messages. Received
	messages that do not use RTF are displayed using the Arial 10- point font. If
	this font is not available, the next closest font is used.
	
	The font displayed in the Inbox for folder names and the message list is
	controlled by the Icon Font setting in Display properties.
