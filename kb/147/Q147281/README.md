	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Goals tab under the Seven Habits Tools allows you to use both the DELETE key
	and the Delete button. These two functions should behave in an identical manner.
	However, the DELETE key only deletes the information from Seven Habits Tools and
	not Schedule+, and the Delete button will remove the information from both the
	Seven Habits Tools and Schedule+.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 7.0 of Microsoft
	Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
