	SYMPTOMS

	Mapper, nothing may happen.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	MIDI Mapper is a program that is not included with Windows 95/98. Because the
	configuration of MIDI is handled differently in Windows 95/98 than it was in
	Windows 3.x, the MIDI Mapper is not functional and therefore, it is not
	available. When you try to run MIDI Mapper from within Bus Stop Utility - Human
	Body, the computer does not respond.
	
	For more information on MIDI configuration for MSB Human in Windows 95/98, please
