	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the Speech Recognition tab in the Microsoft Voice Properties
	dialog box and then click Advanced Settings, the Recognizer Settings Properties
	dialog box appears. You cannot click the Microsoft Voice icon on the taskbar or
	use the Microsoft Voice software until the Recognizer Settings Properties dialog
	box is closed.
	
	In addition, if you switch to another open window so that the Recognizer Settings
	Properties dialog box is still visible, but is no longer the active window, you
	cannot switch back to the Recognizer Settings Properties dialog box by clicking
	the dialog box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you click the Advanced Settings button on the Speech Recognition tab, the
	speech recognition component of the Microsoft Voice software is started. This
	prevents the Microsoft Voice software from accessing the speech recognition
	component until the Recognizer Settings Properties dialog box is closed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To allow the Microsoft Voice software to function properly, close the Microsoft
	Voice Properties dialog box. If the Microsoft Voice Properties dialog box is no
	longer the active window, minimize or close other open windows until the
	Microsoft Voice Properties dialog box becomes the active window.
