## Q147212: Send Fax Wizard Does Not Convert Long File Name for Attachment

	Article: Q147212
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): 95
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): win95

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a message composed using the Send Fax Wizard contains attachments with long
	file names, the attachments are not converted to short file names when they are
	received by a Windows 3.x Microsoft Mail client. If you double-click such an
	attachment in the Microsoft Mail client, you receive a message stating that the
	file is not associated with a program.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, save the attachment in the Microsoft Mail client to
	an appropriate short file name with the correct extension. You can then open the
	attachment using the short file name.
	
	Note that you may also experience the problem described in the following article
