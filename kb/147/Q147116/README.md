	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you press the Tab key while on a Microsoft Exchange Form, it will move the
	cursor between all fields on the form except a Multi-Line Rich Edit Field. To
	move from a Multi-Line Edit Field, use the mouse to click on the next field or
	use the Shift+Tab keys.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Tab key will move the cursor between fields on a Form and will move the
	cursor into a Multi-Line Rich Edit Field. However, the Tab key will not move the
	cursor out of a Multi-Line Rich Edit Field. The Tab key will place Tabs into the
	Multi-Line Rich Edit Field. If the Edit Field is not a Multi- Line Edit Field,
	the Tab key will move to the next field.
	
	This behavior is by design. The Shift+Tab keys should be used to move out of the
	Multi-Line Rich Edit field and into the next field on the form.
