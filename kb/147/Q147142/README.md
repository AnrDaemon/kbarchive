	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	AutoSignatures are not included in Out of Office messages.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. Only messages created by the New Message button, or by
	choosing New Message from the Compose menu (CTRL+N) will include the
	AutoSignature, and only when the Send command is executed.
