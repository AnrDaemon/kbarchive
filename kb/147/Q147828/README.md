	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Dell OptiPlex XMT 5xx systems with BIOS rev. A09 and earlier support 1024x768
	w/65535 colors at 75 Hz and lower. Dell OptiPlex XMT 5xx BIOS revisions A10 and
	later only support 1024x768 w/65535 at 70 Hz and lower.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If a customer requires a BIOS rev. of A10 or later, using a refresh rate of 70
	Hz or lower with this screen resolution/color combination is currently the only
	option. Otherwise, remaining at BIOS rev. A09 and earlier will allow the use of
	the 75 Hz or lower refresh rate.
	
	Customers should contact Dell technical support at (800)624-9896 for any further
	BIOS updates regarding this problem.
