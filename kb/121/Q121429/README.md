## Q121429: Scenes 2.0: Cannot Interrupt Display of Thumbnails

	Article: Q121429
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): WINDOWS:2.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbbuglist

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You cannot select options or exit the Wallpaper dialog box until all the
	wallpaper images have been drawn.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you press the Choose Wallpaper button, Scenes displays a pictorial listing
	of the images for each collection. These small images are saved as *.THM files
	in the \SCENES\PICSETS\<COLLECTION NAME> directory and are know as
	thumbnail images.
	
	The process of drawing the images in the dialog box cannot be interrupted. You
	must wait until all the images are drawn before you can choose another
	collection or apply an image as wallpaper. This can cause a long delay on slow
	machines.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Scenes version 2.0. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
