	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows NT stops responding (hangs) when you try to copy a file during periods
	of high network traffic. If you are using a computer with a built- in network
	adapter, the system may hang intermittently.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	These problems occur when you are using one of the AMD PCNet network adapters
	and the Windows NT version 3.5 AMD Enet driver (PCNTN3.SYS).
