	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you upgrade an earlier version of Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups
	3.x to Windows 95, your font files are not moved from the Windows SYSTEM
	subdirectory to the Windows FONTS subdirectory.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows 95 does not have a means to move your existing font files from the
	Windows SYSTEM subdirectory to the Windows FONTS subdirectory.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you prefer to keep your fonts in one central location, simply move the font
	files from the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory to the Windows FONTS subdirectory.
