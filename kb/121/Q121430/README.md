## Q121430: Scenes 2.0: Transition Effects Occur Only on New Image

{% raw %}

	Article: Q121430
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): WINDOWS:2.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbbuglist

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The transition effects for Microsoft Scenes affect the new image only, not the
	entire screen or the largest image.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If the new image is smaller in size (for example, 640 x 200) than the current
	image (for example, 640 x 400), only the area of the new image can be affected
	by the transition effect. In this example, a small portion above and below the
	new image would not be affected.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Scenes version 2.0. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
