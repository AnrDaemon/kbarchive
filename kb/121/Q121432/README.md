## Q121432: Scenes 2.0: Pictures Do Not Seem to Display Randomly

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When more than one collection is selected in the Screen Saver Settings, the
	images may not appear to display randomly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The selection of an image is not out of a total pool of images. The algorithm
	that selects the next image randomly selects a collection, making sure not to
	use the same collection twice in a row. Within each collection, the image number
	is randomly chosen with no tracking.
	
	For example, if you have selected a collection with 100 images and a collection
	with 10 images, then you will most likely see repeats of the images in the 10
	image collection.
