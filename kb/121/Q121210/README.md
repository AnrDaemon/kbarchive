	The MIDISX application allows the user to edit a system exclusive message and
	transmit it to another MIDI device. The application can receive, display, and
	save to disk up to 64K of returned system exclusive data. MIDI input and output
	devices are selected from the application menu, and the application implements
	techniques that allow it to share MIDI devices with other applications. Wrapper
	functions encapsulate low-level MIDI APIs, handle errors, and simplify
	application code.
