## Q121153: ScanDisk UNDO Date &amp; Time Format Doesn't Use the Country Code

	Article: Q121153
	Product(s): Microsoft Disk Operating System
	Version(s): MS-DOS:6.2,6.21,6.22
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 21-NOV-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The ScanDisk UNDO switch does not use the date and time formatting information
	as it is loaded into memory by the MS-DOS command COUNTRY.SYS. The dialog boxes
	found before and after selecting UNDO switch in ScanDisk show the time and date
	in U.S. English format. These formats should reflect the country code loaded in
	memory at startup.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ScanDisk in MS-DOS versions 6.2,
	6.21, and 6.22. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
