	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Windows NT version 3.5 Setup, the Company Name field accepts 46
	characters, but after choosing OK, the next screen shows that the last 7
	characters have been truncated. For example, after entering the following
	company name:
	
	  Long Name Division Of A Large Products Company
	
	only the following name has been recorded:
	
	  Long Name Division Of A Large Products
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
	Windows NT Server version 3.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
