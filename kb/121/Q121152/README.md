	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When you press the F3 key to exit the first screen of an MS-DOS 6.22
	DoubleSpace-to-DriveSpace conversion, the following dialog box is
	displayed:
	
	  Quitting DriveSpace
	
	  DriveSpace is not completely set up on your system. If you quit now, your hard
	  disk will be unchanged; to compress it, you will need to run DriveSpace
	  again. To quit now, press F3. To continue DriveSpace, press ENTER.
	
	The dialog box suggests that you were attempting a compression rather than
	a DoubleSpace-to-DriveSpace conversion. The dialog box should read as
	follows:
	
	  Quitting DriveSpace
	
	  DriveSpace is not completely set up on your system. If you quit now, your hard
	  disk will be unchanged; to convert it, you will need to run DriveSpace again.
	  To quit now, press F3. To continue DriveSpace, press ENTER.
