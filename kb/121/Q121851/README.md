	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In order to install Windows NT 3.5 on a Compaq Deskpro XL566 computer with a
	built-in PCI SCSI-II controller, a built-in Netflex network adapter, and a
	QVision 2000 video adapter, drivers for these devices are required. These
	drivers are available on the Windows NT 3.5 Installation compact disc at the
	following locations:
	
	  DRVLIB\STORAGE\AMD\X86   (for PCI SCSI-II controller)
	  DRVLIB\NETCARD\X86\PCNET (for the Netflex network adapter)
	  DRVLIB\VIDEO\CPQ2000\X86 (for the QVision 2000 video adapter)
	
	They must be copied from these libraries onto separate floppies, and then used
	during Windows NT Setup.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you do not have a CD-ROM drive or the Windows NT 3.5 Installation compact
	disc, you can obtain the drivers from Compaq. Compaq has just released the
	official support disk for Windows NT 3.5 for Compaq products called the Compaq
	Support Software Diskette (SSD) for Windows NT 3.5 version 1.12a. This will also
	be available on the Compaq forum on CompuServe as Softpaq #925. Refer to the
	README file for a list of drivers.
	
	The Compaq products discussed here are manufactured by Compaq Computer Corp., a
	vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
	regarding the products' performance or reliability.
