	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your mouse stops responding during idle periods. You must reboot your computer
	to again control your mouse.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The ROM BIOS on your computer does not correctly support your mouse port. This
	problem has occurred on a Gateway 2000 P5/90 with an AMI BIOS and Microsoft
	serial mouse.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Upgrade your computer BIOS. In the case above, the AMI BIOS was upgraded to
	revision 1.00.09.AX1T. Contact your hardware vendor for more information.
	
	The Gateway and AMI products included here are manufactured by vendors
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	these products' performance or reliability.
