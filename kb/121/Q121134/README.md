	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 94 of the Windows NT 3.5 "Workstation System Guide," both step 3
	and the picture of the Shared Directory dialog box are incorrect. Under
	the heading User Limit, Unlimited is not an option for Windows NT 3.5
	Workstation. The dialog box has been changed in the product to reflect
	the accurate option of Maximum Allowed, which under Windows NT 3.5
	Workstation is 10. Under step 3, the reference to Unlimited should also be
	Maximum Allowed. Windows NT 3.5 Workstation is limited to 10 inbound
	connections.
