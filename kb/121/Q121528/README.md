	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Creative Writer 1.x and Fine Artist 1.x recognize TrueType fonts only.
	You must have at least one valid True Type font on your system to run Creative
	Writer or Fine Artist.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Creative Writer and Fine Artist do not recognize non-TrueType fonts, such as
	printer fonts or PostScript fonts. If you have no TrueType fonts installed, you
	receive the following alert when you attempt to run either program:
	
	  Windows: "True Type fonts are not enabled."
	
	On the Macintosh, you always have three TrueType fonts included as system FOND
	resources (Chicago, Geneva, Monaco).
	
	Creative Writer and Fine Artist ship with a set of five TrueType fonts. These
	are: Impact, Lucida Blackletter, Lucida Handwriting, Lucida Sans, and Stencil.
	
	Creative Writer 1.1 and Fine Artist 1.1 (on CD-ROM) and the Creative Writer/Fine
	Artist combination CD-ROM (version 1.1a), also include the McZee font. On the
	Macintosh, the Kids Fonts/Kids CD Fonts suitcase must be dragged to the
	appropriate location in the system folder for these fonts to be activated. (Use
	Font/DA Mover on System 6.x Macintoshes.)
