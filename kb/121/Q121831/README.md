	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the font list is partially unreadable, it may be due to a problem with fonts
	installed by other applications that have duplicate font IDs, or a corrupt font.
	Do the following:
	
	1. Run Creative Writer, and log in.
	
	2. When you receive the error message, click Spike to continue.
	
	3. Click the Letterizer Tool and make a note of the font that appears before the
	  corrupt/unreadable font on the list.
	
	4. Exit Creative Writer.
	
	5. From the Apple Menu, choose Key Caps.
	
	6. From the Key Caps menu, find the font that follows the font that you made a
	  note of in step 3.
	
	7. Remove that font from the System Folder:Fonts folder.
	
	8. Open the MSKids:Users folder.
	
	9. Locate your user folder inside the Users folder and open it.
	
	10. Throw the ~Creative Writer Preferences file in the trash.
	
	11. From the Special menu, choose Empty Trash.
