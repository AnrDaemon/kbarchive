	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	While displaying a low percentage rate of remaining battery life, the Battery
	Meter utility reports that the battery status is HIGH.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when the system has an advanced power management (APM) BIOS
	version 1.0 installed. Because the BIOS returns the wrong information when it is
	called, the Battery Meter utility reports battery status HIGH when the battery
	is actually low.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This problem has been confirmed to occur on the Compaq Contura Laptop computer
	and may also occur on other Compaq computers using APM.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Contact Compaq Corporation for information regarding an upgrade to the latest
	version of the APM BIOS.
