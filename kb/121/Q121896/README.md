	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you want to delete files that you created in Fine Artist and/or Creative
	Writer, there are two possible ways to remove them.
	
	Try one of the following two methods.
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	Delete the files from within Creative Writer or Fine Artist:
	
	1. Go to the Library (Creative Writer) or Gallery (Fine Artist).
	
	2. Click Get Rid Of Something from McZee's list of options. If the thumbnail
	  image of the picture is on the wall, drag the thumbnail to the recycle bin.
	  Otherwise, click the Portfolio.
	
	3. Click the file in the Portfolio to select it.
	
	4. Click and drag the thumbnail sketch of the file from the right side of the
	  Porfolio to the Recycle Bin and release the sketch.
	
	NOTE: Method 1 works only for your own files, in your own Portfolio. You cannot
	recycle/delete other users' files.
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	Delete files from Windows Explorer (Windows 95/98), or from within File Manager
	(Windows 3.x), or from the Finder (Macintosh).

	1. Exit Creative Writer or Fine Artist, if one of them is running.
	
	2. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.
	
	3. Locate the Mskids folder.
	
	4. In the Mskids folder, open the Users folder, open your user folder, and then
	  click the file you want to delete.
	
	5. On the File menu, click Delete.
	
	Windows 3.x:
	------------
	
	1. Exit Creative Writer or Fine Artist, if one of them is running.
	
	2. In Program Manager, run File Manager from the Main group.
	
	3. From the MSKIDS directory, open the USERS subdirectory, open your user
	  folder, and select the unwanted file.
	
	4. From the File menu, choose Delete.
	
	Macintosh:

	1. Exit Creative Writer or Fine Artist, if one of them is running.
	
	2. On the hard drive, locate the MSKIDS folder, open it, open the USERS folder,
	  and open your folder.
