	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There is a documentation error in the third-party book "Exploring Creative
	Writer" published by Addison-Wesley.
	
	On page 114, under "Tips and Hints," tip 2 incorrectly states that you should use
	SHIFT+OPTION+A to get to Control Room on the Macintosh. The correct key
	combination is: "SHIFT+COMMAND+A" (without the quotation marks). This is
	correctly documented on the poster that ships with Creative Writer, printed by
	Microsoft.
