	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Creative Writer and Fine Artist check all drives when they start. You see the
	lights for all drives light up as the programs start up. This is by design.
	There is no way to disable this feature.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Creative Writer and Fine Artist check all drives when they start, so that when
	the login screen appears, it has the information that is required in order to
	display all users, whether their files are located on the hard drive, or on a
	disk.
	
	The utility of this feature becomes most apparent in a multiple-user situation,
	such as a classroom, where users are asked to store their files on a diskette
	rather than on the hard drive, to preserve disk space.
