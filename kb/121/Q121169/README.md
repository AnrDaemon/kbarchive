	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using Lotus ScreenCam for Windows version 1.0a, the screen goes
	completely blank--you see nothing other than the mouse moving.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when ScreenCam tries to access Windows 95 internal system
	data using incorrect commands. This prevents ScreenCam from repainting the
	display, resulting in the blank screen.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	ScreenCam does run correctly when loaded from Microsoft Windows version 3.x in a
	virtual machine (VM). For more information about running Microsoft Windows
	version 3.x in a VM, refer to the Windows 95 release notes.
