	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the MS-DOS 6.22 DoubleSpace user interface to convert
	DoubleSpace-compressed drives to DriveSpace format, the second screen,
	"Conversion Confirmation," offers the F1 key for Help. Pressing F1 generates the
	following message:
	
	  DriveSpace is about to convert all Mounted DoubleSpace drives to DriveSpace
	  format. To convert your drives press C. DriveSpace will then convert each of
	  your DoubleSpace drives. If you do not want to convert your DoubleSpace
	  drives press F3 to Exit.
	
	Pressing F3 has no effect and does not allow you to exit the Help dialog box.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Choose the Close button in the Help dialog box and then select the "No To
	Convert" option to exit the DoubleSpace-to-DriveSpace conversion.
