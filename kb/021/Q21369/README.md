	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To get weather and other tower broadcast information, tune your COM radio to the
	appropriate CT or ATIS frequency, as listed in the "Microsoft Flight Simulator
	Information Manual and Flight Handbook."
	
	For Version 3.00, these ATIS frequencies are listed on Pages 159 to 173; for
	Version 4.00 these ATIS frequencies are listed on Pages 149 to 163; for earlier
	versions, please refer to Pages 125 through 137.
	
	To adjust the COM radio, press the "C" key, then use the "+" (PLUS) and "-"
	(MINUS) keys to adjust the frequency. To tune the decimal part of the COM
	radio's frequency, press the "C" key twice, in rapid succession, and then use
	the "+" and "-" keys to tune the frequency. In Versions 3.00 and 4.00, you can
	also tune the COM radio from option C of the NAV/COM menu.
