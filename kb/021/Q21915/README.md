## Q21915: Beep When Editing INPUT or LINE INPUT Statement Responses

	Article: Q21915
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 2.00 2.01 3.00 4.00 4.00b 4.50
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS

	This article explains why the UP, DOWN, PGUP, and PGDN cursor keys
	produce a beep when editing what is typed in response to the INPUT or
	LINE INPUT statement at run time.
	
	The input editor used by INPUT and LINE INPUT is a line editor only.
	This means you can move and edit only horizontally, such as with the
	LEFT and RIGHT ARROW cursor-control keys and the BACKSPACE key.
	Attempts to use the UP, DOWN, PGUP, and PGDN cursor keys produce a
	beep.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC 2.00 2.01 3.00 4.00
	4.00B and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.00 and 6.00B, and to
	Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
