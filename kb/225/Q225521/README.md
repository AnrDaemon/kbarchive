	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After you install Windows NT Server or Workstation version 4.0 Service Pack 4
	(SP4), the installation program automatically launches NotePad and displays the
	Y2k.txt file. The information displayed in the Y2k.txt file, particularly that
	involving the Y2ksetup.exe program, is no longer valid.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To simplify the upgrade process and provide more flexibility to customers, the
	Y2ksetup.exe composite patch has been removed from the recommended upgrade path.
	Y2ksetup.exe was used to install Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack
	1, Microsoft MDAC 2.0 Service Pack 1, and Microsoft Site Server Express 3.0.
	Microsoft now recommends that you install these components individually.
