	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x document in Microsoft Word, select text
	that includes WordPerfect font special characters, and change the font, the
	special characters may change to different characters.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Do the following to obtain the best possible results when opening WordPerfect
	documents in Microsoft Word:
	
	- Install the WordPerfect fonts on your system. For more information about how
	  to install the WordPerfect fonts, please contact WordPerfect.

	- If your document was created in Corel WordPerfect 5.1 or 6.0 for Windows,
	  open the document in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	
	  If your document was created in Corel WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 for DOS, open
	  the document in Corel WordPerfect 5.1 or 6.0 for Windows, save it in the
	  WordPerfect for Windows format, and then open it in Microsoft Word 97 for
	  Windows.
	
	Additional Notes
	----------------
	
	- If the WordPerfect typographical symbol font does not exist on the system,
	  the converter cannot make the symbol into something meaningful. The symbol
	  will become a dash.
	
	- You can insert special characters in WordPerfect by pressing ALT+W and then
	  picking a character number such as 4,4. Many of these WordPerfect special
	  characters are only contained in the fonts shipped by WordPerfect. If your
	  system does not contain these fonts, there is no way to create these
	  characters.
