	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	BackOffice Small Business Server (SBS) version 4.5 includes Microsoft Exchange
	version 5.5 instead of Exchange version 5.0. The licensing in Exchange 5.5 is
	different from Exchange 5.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	With Exchange 5.5, each computer must have a Client license to use the Exchange
	server. If a user wants to open his or her mailbox from multiple computers, a
	Client license is required for each workstation that will use the mailbox.
	
	This differs from Exchange 5.0, in which only one Client license is required to
	use the mailbox.
