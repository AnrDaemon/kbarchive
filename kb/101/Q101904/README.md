	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1c, 3.1d 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the
	workstation Notifier may stop working. This includes the chime, flashing menu
	bar, and Notifier window.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The following are possible causes of this problem:
	
	1. The Notifier Preferences options (chimes, flashing menu bar, and Notifier
	  window) have been turned off.
	
	2. With System 7 or later, the Apple Menu Item is named something other than the
	  required Microsoft Mail.
	
	
	3. A Claris application or any application that uses modal windows is running.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The following are solutions to the causes listed above:
	
	1. To check Notifier Preferences, choose Preferences from the Mail menu. To turn
	  on a Notifier option, select the Notifier icon and then click the desired
	  option.
	
	2. To enter the correct name for the Apple Menu item, open the Apple Menu Items
	  folder from the System folder, and then correctly name the Desk Accessory
	  Microsoft Mail.
	
	3. There is no known workaround for this situation. It is known that many Claris
	  applications disable the Notifier options until you exit the Claris
	  application.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.1 of
	Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will
	post new information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
