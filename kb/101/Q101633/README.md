	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	By using Microsoft's TrueType Font Pack version 1 and Windows NT Services for
	Macintosh (SFM), you can print from a Macintosh computer to a non- PostScript
	printer attached to a Windows NT Advanced Server or Windows NT Server running
	SFM. This functionality is provided by the TrueImage interpreter that converts a
	PostScript file into a high-resolution bitmap image.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To support this feature, a Windows NT Advanced Server or Windows NT Server must

	order the TrueType Font Pack version 1, part number 209-650v100, from your local
	reseller or directly from Microsoft. In the United States, call Microsoft
