	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks do not encrypt the
	contents of the server data file or local user data.
	
	Encryption schemes are used when mail data is being transferred from the user
	workstation to the server or between servers.
	
	Because of this, Microsoft recommends placing the mail server in a physically
	secure location such as a computer room. Sensitive data should not be placed on
	local user machines unless that machine is also physically secure or there is
	additional software security available.
