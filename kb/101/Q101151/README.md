## Q101151: Can't Modify Screen or Form without a Mouse

	Article: Q101151

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
	- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Although you can create a quick screen or form without using a mouse in the
	FoxPro 2.x Screen Builder or Visual FoxPro Form Designer, a mouse is required to
	subsequently modify that screen or form.
	
	The Screen Builder and Form Designer toolbars cannot be accessed without a mouse.
	This behavior is by design. FoxPro for MS-DOS does not have a toolbar for its
	Screen Builder; it uses menus instead.
	
	NOTE: The system requirements listed on the FoxPro for Windows and Visual FoxPro
	boxes state that a mouse or compatible pointing device is required.
