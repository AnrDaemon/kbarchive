	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After upgrading to MS-DOS 6.0 from MS-DOS 5.x, one way to return to MS-DOS 5.x
	is to use the Uninstall disk created during the MS-DOS 6.0 upgrade process.
	However, if the Uninstall disk is unavailable and you decide to follow the
	instructions on the original MS-DOS 5.x upgrade disk by running the Setup
	program, you may receive the following message:
	
	  UNRECOVERABLE ERROR
	  Cannot identify your version of DOS.
	  Returning to DOS.
	  Press ENTER to continue.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, reboot your machine with a startup disk containing
	system files of MS-DOS (version 2.11 to 5.x) and then run the Setup program for
	MS-DOS 5.x.
