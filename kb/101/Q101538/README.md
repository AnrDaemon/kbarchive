	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you run Musical Instruments on a Radius Color Monitor that is set to
	Landscape view, and then pivot the monitor to Page (portrait) view, the right
	side of the Musical Instruments display will be cut off.
	
	To restore your screen metrics, you must quit and restart Musical Instruments in
	Page view.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Musical Instruments for the
	Macintosh, version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
