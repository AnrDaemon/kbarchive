	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE), if a message with
	attachments is sent that has exceeded its "useful life" and the asynchronous
	communication is interrupted, the message is returned to the sender with no
	attachments. If the same scenario exists but there is no interruption of
	asynchronous services, the message with attachments is delivered to the remote
	client even though the useful life has been exceeded.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
