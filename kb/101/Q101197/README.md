	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Hercules Graphics Station video card runs correctly in standard mode only if
	you are using version 2.05 or higher of this card. You can locate the version of
	the card by running TIGACD.EXE, which ships with the card. The TIGACD sign-on
	message displays the TIGA version number.
	
	If you try to start Windows in standard mode with an earlier version of this
	card, the lower half of the screen displays garbage characters and the upper
	half is black.

	standard mode.
