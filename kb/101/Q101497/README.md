	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	After you upgrade to MS-DOS, you may be unable to access a Pacific Rim external
	floppy disk drive on an IBM PS/2 machine. Pacific Rim Systems has confirmed that
	no workaround is available at this time.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For more information, including driver updates, contact Pacific Rim Systems.
	
	Any attempt to access the external floppy disk drive generates activity on the
	other floppy disk drive(s) and generates the prompt for the external floppy
	drive. For example, if drive B designates Pacific Rim's external floppy disk
	drive, drive A is activated with a B command prompt, and information in drive A
	is displayed.
	
	The Pacific Rim Systems product included here is manufactured by a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	this product's performance or reliability.
