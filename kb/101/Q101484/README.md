	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When rebuilding a version 3.0 or 3.1 Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks data
	file using Mail Tools, gateway names in the Personal Address Book (PAB) created
	by the user are recovered. However, because rebuilding the Mail Data file does
	not recover any installed gateways, these recovered gateway names are invalid.
	System gateway names, gateway names created by the Network Manager, are NOT
	recovered.
