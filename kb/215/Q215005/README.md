	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are running a Remote Control session with a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
	Systems Management Server (SMS) client and you start a program with a blinking
	insertion point (such as Notepad) remotely from the Administrator console, the
	mouse pointer movement in the session becomes noticeably jerky or sluggish. If
	you minimize the program or cover it with another window, the mouse pointer
	movement becomes smooth again.
	
	Windows NT 3.51, Microsoft Windows 3.x, Microsoft Windows 95, and Microsoft
	Windows 98 SMS clients do not experience this symptom.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 2.0.
