	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If the ControlService() API is called simultaneously from different threads to
	stop multiple services, some services are stopped successfully while others
	eventually time out with an error 1053 (ERROR_SERVICE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT).
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because a race condition in Services.exe causes a deadlock.
	This causes the stop request to time out.
