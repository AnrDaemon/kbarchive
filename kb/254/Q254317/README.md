	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to export and copy maps from Microsoft MapPoint 2001
	to Microsoft Pocket Streets.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To export and copy maps from MapPoint 2001 to Pocket Streets, use the following
	methods in the order in which they are presented.
	
	Export the Map to Pocket Streets
	--------------------------------
	
	1. Use the Select tool to select the map area that you want to export.
	
	  NOTE: Any Pushpins that are included in the selected area are also exported.
	
	2. On the File menu, click Export Map for Pocket Streets.
	
	  You receive a message advising you of the approximate file size of the map
	  area that you selected.
	
	  NOTE: Make sure that enough space is available on the PC Companion to contain
	  the map area that you want to export. For more information, see the
	  documentation provided with your PC Companion.
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	4. Type a name for the map area, and then click Save. The file creation process
	  may take several minutes, depending on the speed of the desktop computer.
	
	5. After the file is created, you receive a dialog box that contains the path to
	  the folder in which the file is saved.
	
	  By default, the file is saved in the My Documents folder on Microsoft Windows
	  98-based desktop computers and in the following folder on Microsoft Windows
	  2000-based desktop computers
	
	  Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents
	
	  on the hard disk on which Microsoft Windows is installed.
	
	Copy the Map to Your PC Companion
	---------------------------------
	
	1. Connect your PC Companion to your desktop computer.
	
	2. On your desktop computer, double-click the Microsoft Windows CE Services or
	  the ActiveSync icon, and then click Explore.
	
	3. When Windows Explorer opens showing the Mobile Device folder for your PC
	  Companion, use Windows Explorer to locate any map (.mps) or Pushpin (.psp)
	  files that you exported for use with Pocket Streets.
	
	4. Copy these files to a folder in the Mobile Device folder for your PC
	  Companion.
	
	Notes
	-----
	
	- If the map you exported contains Pushpins, a corresponding Pushpin (.psp)
	  file is exported with the map. Both the map and the Pushpin files must be
	  copied to the same folder on the PC Companion.
	
	- If you copy files to a palm-sized PC, you must copy the files to the My
	  Documents folder.
	
	- If you copy files to a compact flash card, you must first create a My
	  Documents folder on the compact flash card, and then copy the files to that
	  folder.
