	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you import addresses into one of the programs listed at the beginning of
	this article, the program may take several minutes to place the addresses on the
	map, or the program may appear to stop responding (hang).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you attempt to import an address list in which one or
	more of the addresses is not complete.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, make sure that all of the addresses are complete before
	you import them into the program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The programs listed at the beginning of this article are designed to import
	complete addresses.
	
	When you import addresses into one of these programs,the program requires only
	the street addresses and the postal codes (ZIP Codes) to find the locations on
	the map. However, the program must perform many additional calculations if
	complete addresses are not provided. These additional calculations can slow the
	response time.
