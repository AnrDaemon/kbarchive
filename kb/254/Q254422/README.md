	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you use the Data Mapping Wizard in Microsoft MapPoint 2001 to create a map of
	population by county, the following counties are displayed with a population of
	zero:
	
	- Denali, Alaska
	- Yakutat, Alaska
	
	This behavior occurs because these counties are new administrative districts that
	did not exist at the time of the 1990 census. As a result, no demographic data
	is available for these counties in MapPoint 2001.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Canadian territory of Nunavit is also displayed with a population of zero.
