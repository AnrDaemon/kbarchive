## Q67656: Zenith ZBF-3339-EK 16 MHz 386 Conflict w/ Server Services

	Article: Q67656
	Product(s): Microsoft LAN Manager
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 30-JUL-2001
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Failure to complete a NET START NETLOGON command, with general network failure
	error 2136 indicates a hardware conflict. In one reported case, the system
	included a WD8003E Ethercard Plus card and the MACWD.OS2 driver, configured
	correctly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Although the interrupts were correct, something still conflicted with OS/2 LAN
	Manager.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	NET START NETLOGON completed successfully when these changes were made:
	
	- INT to 5
	
	- Mem to D1000
	
	- IOAddress to 300
	
	Note: Because this problem was due to a hardware conflict, Error 2136 could have
	been generated by any number of other server service commands (for example,
	REPLICATOR).
