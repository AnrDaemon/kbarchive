	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Climb-out Checklist on the 747 instrument panel indicates that cruising
	speed is Mach .85; however, Flight Simulator does not calculate Mach. Flight
	Simulator reports your speed in knots.
	
	In real terms, Mach 1 is 741.8 knots at sea level at 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Mach
	.85 under these conditions would be 630.5 knots. The speed that is needed to
	break the sound barrier fluctuates depending on altitude and temperature.
