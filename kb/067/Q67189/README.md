	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot add an Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) frequency with
	Microsoft Flight Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer version 4.00. This is
	by program design.
	
	ATIS is a continuous-loop recording of important air traffic information
	broadcast over a specific frequency. It is used to inform pilots of important
	weather and airfield conditions, and is usually updated once an hour.
