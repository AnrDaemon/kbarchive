## Q67162: C 6.00a Setup with Monochrome Monitor

	Article: Q67162
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 6.00a   | 6.00a
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS | OS/2

	When using the Setup program that comes with the C version 6.00 to
	6.00a update kit on a monochrome system, the selected menu item may be
	invisible. To correct the problem, use the /mono switch as shown in
	the following example:
	
	   setup /mono
	
	This switch is not documented.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the C Compiler version
	6.00 to 6.00a update kit Setup program. This problem does not affect
	the Setup program for any other C 6.00a package. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
