	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can use the CH Products Mach III joystick with Flight Simulator (FS) and
	Aircraft & Scenery Designer. The joystick can be connected to either a CH
	Products game card or an IBM PC/XT/AT/PS2 or compatible game card.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Both the Mach II and the Mach III joystick provide two axis cursor controls and
	two push button switches. The Mach III provides an additional push button on the
	top of the handle that duplicates the function of one of the push buttons.
	
	If needed, use either rotary control knob located to the left or above the stick
	handle to center the joystick handle. The top (above) side is the side into
	which the cord connects.
	
	The joystick also contains mode slide switches to allow either spring
	self-centering or free floating modes. Moving the switches toward the lower
	right corner of the joystick box (closest to each other) sets the joystick in
	self-centering mode.
	
	Once the joystick is centered as preferred, proceed through the initial FS
	startup screens and respond Yes when asked to use the joystick. Refer to page
	171 of the "Microsoft Flight Simulator: Information Manual and Flight Handbook"
	for additional information about calibrating a joystick.
	
	Not all 15 pins of the game card connector must be present to connect the 15-pin
	male joystick connector to the adapter. The joystick requires at least the
	following pins to operate successfully:
