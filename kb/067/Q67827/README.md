	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Kensington Expert Mouse driver may not work properly with Flight Simulator
	version 4.00.
	
	A possible workaround is to use a Microsoft mouse driver. Customers should also
	contact Kensington at (800) 535-4242 to check on the availability of an updated
	driver.
	
	Microsoft has not tested this configuration and therefore cannot guarantee its
	results.
