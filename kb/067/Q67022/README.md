	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you get the following message when you run the Fontware Setup program, and
	you enter the Fontware directory name
	
	  Unable to make this directory. Choose a different directory
	
	you have entered a directory name that the kit cannot create on your hard disk.
	Press ESC and enter a different directory name. This may indicate a general
	problem with writing to your hard disk, or you may have selected the name of a
	file that already exists. Note that Fontware will not accept any directory name
	that DOS does not accept as a directory name.
