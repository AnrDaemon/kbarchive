	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There is no feature in Flight Simulator that will allow for simulated snow as
	part of the weather generator.
	
	However, you can get an interesting effect by doing the following:
	
	1. From the Enviro menu, select option B, Clouds.
	
	2. Select 5, Bottom Level Tops, type "1000" (without the quotation marks), and
	  press ENTER.
	
	3. Press 7, Cover, until "scattered 1/8" appears.
	
	4. Press SPACEBAR to return to flight mode.
	
	The clouds will appear as small white circles that look like snow.
