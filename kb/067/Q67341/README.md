## Q67341: Trail of Multiple Cursors in Desqview 386

{% raw %}

	Article: Q67341
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 1.00
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | cursors trail mouse port setup | mspl13_basic

	If the Microsoft Serial Mouse is connected to a mouse port in a PS/2
	style machine, you may see a trail of red cursors inside the windows
	of Desqview 386 when you use QEMM 5.0.
	
	This is not a problem with the mouse. This problem occurs if you have
	selected "serial" in the port selection for the mouse when you set up
	Desqview. If you select "add-on board" for the mouse port selection in
	the Desqview Setup program, the mouse cursor will display normally.
	Note: This problem will not occur if the mouse is connected to the
	serial port.
