	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit never asks for disk 2 of the
	Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package, some files in a Bitstream Scalable Typeface
	Package may not be needed, depending on the devices you select when you set up
	Fontware. If the kit doesn't need disk 2 of the Bitstream Scalable Typeface
	Package, it won't ask for it.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
