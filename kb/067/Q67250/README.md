	- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	CustCont.exe is a sample file that contains the source code for a generic custom
	control. The following basic custom control features are demonstrated:
	
	- How to register the control class.
	
	- How to create the control.
	
	- How to paint the control.
	
	- How to change the font in the control.
	
	- How to gain and lose focus.
	
	- How to move and size the control.
	
	The control is essentially a three-dimensional static rectangle with text. The
	functions necessary to interact with the Windows Dialog Editor are implemented
	in a separate module. These functions are documented in Chapter 20 of the
	"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Guide to Programming" for version
	3.0.
	
	CUSTCONT contains two archive files. The first, CTL.ZIP, contains the sources for
	the custom control DLL. The second, CTLTEST.ZIP, contains the sources for a
	small program that demonstrates the use of the control.
