	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When the ADF frequency is set to the frequency of the outer-marker (396) at
	Snohomish County Airport (Paine Field) in Everett, Washington, the ADF needle
	will not function.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the customer has Aircraft & Scenery Designer, this problem can be
	resolved by placing a nondirectional beacon (NDB) in the location of the
	outer-marker and setting the frequency of the NDB to 396. The following
	coordinates give the approximate position of the outer- marker while directly in
	line with the runway at Paine Field.
	
	  North    21583.8509
	  East     6684.9234
	  Heading  156
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 4.00. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
