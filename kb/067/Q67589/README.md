	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 7.10

	On page 86 of the "Microsoft BASIC 7.1: Getting Started" manual, the
	first sentence of the second paragraph under the "Extended Memory"
	section has a typographical error. The word "tsrmin" should be changed
	to read "hmamin".
	
	The corrected sentence should read as follows:
	
	   When using the HIMEM.SYS device driver, you should set hmamin to 63
	   (64512 bytes) to ensure that QBX has access to the high-memory
	   area.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft Professional Development System
	(PDS) version 7.10 for MS-DOS.
