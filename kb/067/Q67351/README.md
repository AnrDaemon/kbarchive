	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet III with the HP PostScript Cartridge may print
	incorrect characters if the cartridge has not been installed correctly. This
	happens even if the PostScript Driver has been selected in Printer Setup. The
	printer needs to be initialized for the PostScript language by completely
	restarting it.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To install the cartridge correctly, do the following:
	
	1. Turn off the printer.
	
	2. Place the cartridge in the cartridge slot until you can hear it snap into
	  place.
	
	3. Turn on the printer; it will initialize in Postscript mode.
	
	You must also use this procedure when changing the mode back to HPPCL5A language.
	You must turn the printer off and take the PostScript cartridge out. Then
	restart the printer, and it will return to HPPCL5A mode.
