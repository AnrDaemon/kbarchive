	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If a single SubLOGIC scenery disk is installed, option A (Automatic Scenery
	Selection) on the Nav/Com menu is not active. When two or more SubLOGIC scenery
	disks are installed, option A is active. When option A is active, a mode that
	makes use of SubLOGIC scenery will automatically load the appropriate scenery
	file without further intervention.
	
	If you are using a single SubLOGIC scenery disk, you must, from the Nav/Com menu,
	select Scenery Library, then select the desired SubLOGIC scenery file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some SubLOGIC scenery files do not work properly with the Automatic Scenery
	Selection feature. It may therefore be necessary to manually select the scenery
	file from the Scenery Library.
