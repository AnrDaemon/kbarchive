	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When attempting to load an OS/2 Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) extension through a
	macro definition in the TOOLS.INI file, if the extension file does not exist, or
	is not in the current path, the following error message is displayed in a dialog
	box:
	
	  pwbhelp: SYS0123: A file name or volume label contains an incorrect character
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This error message should indicate that the extension file could not be found;
	however, the message is generated by the OS/2 operating system's DLL loading
	code, and therefore, cannot be changed by PWB.
	
	The following error message is generated in the MS-DOS version of PWB, which
	displays this message in a dialog box:
	
	  No such file or directory
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct the problem, make sure that the directory in which the extension
	resides is in the current path.
