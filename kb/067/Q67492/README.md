	================
	
	All installation procedures below are done from MS-DOS.
	
	How to Install PageMaker version 3.00 for use with Windows 2.x
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	
	1. Install the full version of Windows 2.x. A copy of the run-time Windows 2.x
	  is included with PageMaker 3.0 and 3.01. PageMaker will install the run-time
	  version of Windows 2.x if the PageMaker Install program does not detect that
	  Windows is already installed.
	
	2. Install PageMaker 3.0. Note: PageMaker 3.01 will not work with Windows 2.x.
	
	How to Install PageMaker version 3.01 for use with Windows 3.00
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	
	1. Install Windows 3.00. Note that Windows 3.00 is not included with any version
	  of PageMaker.
	
	2. Install PageMaker 3.0. If you already have PageMaker 3.0 installed, then skip
	  to step 3. You can install the file filters later when you install the
	  PageMaker 3.01 update.
	
	3. Install the PageMaker 3.01 update. This will update PageMaker 3.0 to version
	  3.01. The PageMaker 3.01 update is contained on a single disk.
	
	Notes
	-----
	
	The PageMaker 3.0 or 3.01 Install program may change the "SET TEMP=.." statement
	in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the PageMaker directory if you elect to let
	PageMaker make changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The PageMaker Install program
	will prompt you to let it modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and add the PageMaker
	directory to the PATH and change SET TEMP to the PageMaker directory.
	
	It is not possible to have the PageMaker Install program change only the path.
	Install will either change both the PATH and the SET TEMP or neither. If it is
	not desired to change the SET TEMP statement in the AUTOEXEC.bat, do not allow
	the Install program to modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT. Add the PageMaker directory to
	the PATH manually, afterwards.

	support.
