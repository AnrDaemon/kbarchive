	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot use the Fontware Installation Kit to install Bitstream SoftFonts.
	Although SoftFonts and Fontware are both made by Bitstream, they are two
	separate products. SoftFonts should be installed using the SoftFont Installer
	provided with the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printer driver.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment coupon
	included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows. This
	starter kit will install fonts for Windows applications only; however, the kit
	can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for multiple
	applications.
