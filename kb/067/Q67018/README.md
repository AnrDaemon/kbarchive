	When you add typefaces in Fontware and you get the following message
	
	  Warning: Those typefaces that were copied may not be usable for making
	  PostScript PDL Printer fonts
	
	it means that you pressed ESC before adding the second typeface disk that
	contains information that Fontware needs to make fonts for PostScript PDL
	printers. Try adding the typeface again.
