	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Epson Series-80, the FX, RX, and MX (older versions) may not print correctly
	with Microsoft Windows without a ROM upgrade, which is available from Epson.
	
	To test to see if your Epson printer needs this ROM upgrade, do the following:
	
	1. Turn off the printer.
	
	2. Turn the printer back on while holding down the line feed button.
	
	3. The printer will begin to do a self test. If the printer keeps printing after
	  three to four lines, you need the graphics upgrade. If it stops, you already
	  have the upgrade installed, or you have a newer printer with the ROM upgrade
	  built in.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The upgrade is called Dots Perfect; it is a chip that fits on the printer
	board.
	
	To order Dots Perfect, contact Epson.
	
	You will need to specify your printer model and type because there is a different
	chip for each model. This chip will also allow your printer to print graphics.
