	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The GameCard III (automatic MCA) built by CH Products provides two joystick
	connectors. The top connector is A; the bottom connector is B. To use two
	joysticks with Flight Simulator, the two jumpers behind connector A must be
	removed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Each joystick (via connector) has an X and Y axis available to it. With both
	jumpers present, joystick A uses the Y axis of joystick B for throttle control.
	At this point, connector A is referred to as a "one and a half joystick," and
	the joysticks will interfere with each other and not operate correctly. Removing
	both of the jumpers behind connector A disables the throttle control on joystick
	A and allows normal use of both joysticks.
	
	An alternative way to use two joysticks without removing the jumpers is to use a
	Y-cable on connector A.
