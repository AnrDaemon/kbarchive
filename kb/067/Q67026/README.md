	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following is a brief description of the requirements for the Fontware 3.0
	Installation Kit.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	- You must have one or more Bitstream Fontware Typefaces (included with your
	  kit or purchased separately). Each Bitstream Fontware Typeface Package
	  contains the source designs for at least one typeface (often related
	  typefaces are included in four styles).
	
	- You must have an IBM PC AT or 100-percent compatible with at least 512K of
	  memory, a hard (fixed) disk drive, a high-density or double-density 5.25- or
	  3.5-inch disk drive, and a monitor. The amount of disk space needed for the
	  hard drive varies depending on your application and the devices for which you
	  are making fonts. You'll need approximately 1.1 to 1.2 megabytes for your
	  first installation kit. For additional kits, you'll need approximately 250K.
	  You should also have at least 900K free for font storage.
	
	- MS-DOS or PC-DOS (version 3.1 or later) must be installed on your hard disk.
	
	- Your Windows application(s) must be installed on the hard drive.
	
	- At least one of the supported devices for the Windows application must be
	  listed in the Fontware documentation.
	
	A Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit (FIK) is available through a fulfillment
	coupon included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows.
