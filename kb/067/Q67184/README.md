	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the scientific mode of the Microsoft Windows Calculator application, the
	square root button (sqrt) disappears.
	
	To mathematically perform the square root function in the scientific mode, use
	the (x^y) button as the following example demonstrates. To calculate the square
	root of 144, do the following:
	
	1. Type "144" (without the quotation marks).
	
	2. Press the (x^y) button.
	
	3. Type "0.5" (without the quotation marks) or ".5" (without the quotation
	  marks).
	
	4. Press the equal sign (=) button or another operator button.
	
	The number 12, the square root of 144, should be the result displayed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Mathematically, you can rewrite the square root of a number (x in the example
	below) in the following manner to obtain an equivalent equation:
	
	     _____
	1.  \/ x        is equal to...
	
	    2_____
	2.  \/ x^1      which is equal to...
	
	     (1/2)           (.5)
	3.  x^          or  x^
	
	NOTE: The equation in step 3 represents the (x^y) button; therefore, it can be
	used as the equivalent substitution for the (sqrt) button.
