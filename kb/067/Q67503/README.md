	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Windows Notepad version 3.0, if you choose Page Setup from the File
	menu and set Top Margin to 0 (zero), the first two lines print on top of each
	other or overlap. This problem affects the following Hewlett- Packard (HP)
	printers:
	
	  HP LaserJet Series II
	  HP LaserJet Series IIP
	  HP LaserJet Series IID
	  HP LaserJet Series III
	
	This problem occurs because you are attempting to print outside the areas where
	the printer is capable of printing.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Most HP LaserJet Series printers can print no closer than .25 inch from the page
	margins. To correct the problem, set Top Margin to .25 inch or greater.
	
	NOTE: Most PostScript printers exclude the first line and start printing with the
	second line.
	
	The HP products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
	performance or reliability.
