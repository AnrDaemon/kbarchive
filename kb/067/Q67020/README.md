	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are setting up Fontware and adding a typeface, you may get the
	following message:
	
	  Unable to copy all typeface information. Errors occurred while copying
	  typefaces.
	
	This message is generated when the Fontware kit is unable to read the disk from
	which you are trying to copy. If you are using a backup of a Fontware
	Installation Kit disk or a Bitstream Scalable Typeface disk, exit the kit, make
	a new backup copy, and try again. If the disk is an original typeface disk, you
	will need to obtain a replacement disk.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment coupon
	included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows. This
	starter kit will install fonts for Windows applications only; however, the kit
	can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for multiple
	applications as described above.
