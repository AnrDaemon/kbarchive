	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To set up and run Microsoft Windows 3.0 on a machine with the AST 3G Plus II EGA
	video adapter, check the following:
	
	1. Disable the autoswitching, which is termed "autoemulation" by AST, by turning
	  off dip switches #5 and #6. The remaining switches determine the type of
	  monitor.
	
	2. Check the ROM BIOS. If the BIOS version is earlier than 3.0, obtain an
	  upgrade of 3.0 or later from AST.
	
	3. Set the emulation switch to off. The emulation switch is on the back of the
	  card where the monitor plugs into the board. Early versions of the card have
	  the switch, so you must look on the back of the card to know if the switch is
	  there. According to AST, having the switch in the on position could cause
	  video problems when you run DOS applications under Windows.
