	The M editor can make use of the 43-line EGA text mode and 50-line VGA
	text mode. The "height" numeric switch in the TOOLS.INI file specifies
	the number of lines used in the editing window; however, this number
	does NOT include the dialog and status display lines. Thus, to use 43
	lines of text you must set height=41; to use 50 lines you must set
	height=48.
