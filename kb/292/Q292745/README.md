	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	CD-ROM: HtmlClock.exe Does Not Run
	----------------------------------
	
	If you try to run the HtmlClock.exe file directly from the
	C:\progmfc2\Chap10\HtmlClock\Release directory, you may receive a "page not
	found" error message in the browser window.
	
	This problem can be corrected by placing a copy of clock.htm, found on the CD in
	the \progmfc2\Code\Chap10\HtmlClock directory, in the Release directory with the
	HtmlClock.exe file.
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
