	The development of these scripts was canceled before the release of the Microsoft
	Windows 2000 Resource Kit. However, the documentation inadvertently made it into
	the Resource Kit.
	
	The Resource Kit development team will not be providing these scripts, nor will
	they be released in future updates or supplements of the Resource Kit.
