	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	CD-ROM: Remote_scripts.hhc File Contains Broken/Invalid URL's
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Remote_scripts.hhc file contains two URL's that are broken/invalid. The first
	one is "http://www.msn.com", which incorrectly links to
	"http://http://www.msn.com"
	
	The second is http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/wmi/hmmqual_17qr.htm. This
	is an invalid URL.
	
	
	CD-ROM: Incorrect Help File
	---------------------------
	
	The tools help files provided with the CD for this Resource Kit are actually
	those created for the Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit. These help files include
	information on tools that are not included in the SBS 2000 Resource Kit. This is
	mentioned in the readme.txt.
	
	
	Page 105: Incorrect Location Sited For White Paper
	--------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 105 there is an important note toward the bottom of the page that
	indicates that a white paper is included on the CD in the \upgrade folder that
	will provide additional information on SBS 2000 migration upgrades. There is no
	\upgrade folder on the Resource Kit CD-ROM.
	
	The title of the white paper is "Small Business Server 2000 Migrations Upgrade".
	The white paper is located on the Small Business Server Web site at:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/SBSERVER/deployadmin/MigrationUp_wp.htm
	
	
	Back Cover: Incorrect Reference to TAPI
	---------------------------------------
	
	On the back cover of the Resource Kit, the reference to TAPI is incorrect. The
	Resource Kit does not include tools for the Telephony Applications Programming
	Interface (TAPI).
	
	Change:
	"Other resources: Get complete appendixes full of information about networking
	basic, migrating from Netware, customization and extensibility options,
	deployment with Microsoft 2000, Telephony Applications Programming Interface
	(TAPI) solutions, and more."
	
	To:
	"Other resources: Get complete appendixes full of information about networking
	basic, migrating from Netware, customization and extensibility options,
	deployment with Microsoft 2000, and more."
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
