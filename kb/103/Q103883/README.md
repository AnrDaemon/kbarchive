	LOCAL I/O OPERATION
	
	When an application requests I/O services, the underlying operating
	system calls device driver software that is resident in BIOS on most
	MS-DOS PCs. Device driver software is written to communicate with the
	device controller card, and can thus forward the I/O request to
	firmware that is resident on the controller.
	
	The device controller then provides the required control signals to
	the device.
