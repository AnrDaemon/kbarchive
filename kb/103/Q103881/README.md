	In 1978, the International Standards Organization (ISO) introduced
	the ISO model for Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) as a first step
	toward international standardization of the various protocols
	required for network communication.
	
	The OSI ISO model:
	
	- Was designed to establish data communications standards that would promote
	  multi-vendor interoperability.
	
	- Consists of seven layers, with a specific set of network functions allocated
	  to each layer, and guidelines for implementation of the interfaces between
	  layers.
	
	- Details a specific set of protocols and interfaces to implement at each
	  layer. So far, only the lowest four layers have been explicitly defined. The
	  upper layers, and their interfaces to the lower ones, have not yet been
	  completed. The overall model has become the basis for the government's
	  required standard environment, GOSIP, beginning in August 1990.
	
	Each layer of the OSI model can be viewed as an independent module.
	You may (theoretically) substitute one protocol for another at the
	same layer without affecting the operation of layers above or below.
	
	In addition to explicitly defining protocols and interfaces at
	selected layers, the OSI model also serves as a concept, providing a
	reference for how data communication should take place. It provides a
	common basis for the coordination of standards development for the
	purpose of systems interconnection, while allowing existing standards
	and architectures to be placed in perspective within the overall
	reference model.
	
	The principles that led to the creation of seven layers are:
	
	- A layer should be created only where a different level of abstraction is
	  required.
	
	- Each layer should perform a well defined function.
	
	- The function of each layer should be chosen with an eye toward defining
	  internationally standardized protocols.
	
	- The layer boundaries should be chosen to minimize the information flow across
	  the interfaces.
	
	- The number of layers should be large enough that distinct functions need not
	  be thrown together in the same layer out of necessity, and small enough that
	  the architecture does not become unwieldy.
