	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	NETWORK COMMANDS, UTILITIES AND SERVICES
	----------------------------------------
	
	Microsoft network operating systems, such as LAN Manager, include several
	commands, utilities, and services.
	
	- Commands and utilities, such as the NET USE command and the full-screen NET
	  ADMIN utility make it easy for end users to access and control network
	  resources.
	
	- Services. The server service allows a station to make its resources, such as
	  disks and printers, available to users on other stations. The messenger
	  service allows a user to exchange small messages with other network users.
	
	Network commands, utilities and services use network application programmer
	interface (API) calls to communicate, through the local redirector, with remote
	stations.
