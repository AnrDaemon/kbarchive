	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft SMARTDrive version 5.0 supports CD-ROM drive caching. Any CD-ROM that
	is supported by Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX.EXE) can be cached by
	SMARTDrive.
	
	To take advantage of this feature, you must load MSCDEX.EXE before SMARTDRV.EXE
	(typically in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file).
	
	To verify that your CD-ROM drive is being cached by SMARTDrive, type "smartdrv"
	(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.
