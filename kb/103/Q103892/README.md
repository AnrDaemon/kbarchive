	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	During the installation of Bookshelf 1993 upgrade, you are prompted to insert
	the disc of the earlier version of Bookshelf. Once Setup recognizes the previous
	version, it will ask for the Bookshelf 1993 upgrade disc again and continue the
	installation. The earlier version of Bookshelf does not need to be installed for
	the upgrade.
	
	If the upgrade installation fails to recognize the earlier version of Bookshelf,
	you can force the system to re-read the disc by using F5 in the Windows File
	Manager. For more information on this, query on the following words in the
