	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When Visual C++ 32-bit Edition is installed, the program group created by the
	Setup program is a personal program group. This program group appears only for a
	specific user. Other users of the same computer cannot see the Visual C++ for
	Windows NT program group; the registry key is not created for them, and the user
	environments aren't set up properly.
	
	
	For more information on Windows NT user privileges, see the Readme.wri file,
	which can be accessed by selecting the README icon located in the program group.
