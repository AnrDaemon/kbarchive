	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	With versions 3.0, 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you choose New
	Messages from the View menu and find new mail, the envelope flashes but the
	new-mail chime does not sound.

	There is no workaround at this time. You do not, however, miss the arrival of
	new mail if you have chosen View New Messages: new mail is immediately displayed
	on the screen.

	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
