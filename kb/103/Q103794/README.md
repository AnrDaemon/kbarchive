## Q103794: PC Forms: No Save As Command in Routing Form

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
	   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are reading a message created using the Routing Form included with
	version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, the Save As command does not
	appear on the File menu. This is unique to the Routing form, since both the
	Telephone Note form and the Generic Template include a Save As command.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This feature is by design because the Routing Form is intended to send a
	document through a revision process. Saving the form in the middle of the review
	process may lead to future confusion.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To save the text contained in the Instruction and Previous Comments box, you can
	copy and paste the information from the form into a word-processing application.
	From the word processor, you can save the information to a file.
