	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create a new folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
	Windows, the following error may occur:
	
	  This name or comment is too long. Type a shorter name or comment.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Mail for Windows allows a maximum folder name of 127 characters. The new
	folder's Name field does not prevent you from typing names longer than 127
	characters, but Mail displays the error message when you choose OK.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Devise a folder name of 127 or fewer characters and choose OK to create the
	folder.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
