## Q103449: PC Win: Address Book Does Not Limit Extended Characters

	Article: Q103449
	Product(s): Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.1,3.2
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows do not check the
	validity of characters typed in fields in the Address Book and its related
	dialog boxes. Therefore, invalid characters can be typed in fields.
	
	For example, you can type letters in the Fax Number box. Data checking occurs
	only for fields that require data to be entered and for carriage
	return-linefeeds (for the Personal Address Book).
	
	You can also type invalid characters in the New User dialog box, and the Address
	Book will accept these characters.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2
	of Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
