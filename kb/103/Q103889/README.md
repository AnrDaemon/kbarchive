	A number of problems can occur in the data flow path between two
	network stations and they can cause errant, restricted or even
	halted communication. Trace utilities make it possible to find
	problems in vertical interfaces or peer protocols so that proper
	network communications can be restored.
	
	VERTICAL INTERFACE TRACE UTILITIES
	
	Since layer entities within a station call layer entities above and
	below through established service access points (SAPs) in order to pass
	a defined interface data unit (IDU) structure, interface trace
	utilities can be written to:
	
	- "Hook" the SAP entry point, saving the original entry point
	
	- Gain control when the SAP entry point is called
	
	- Examine the IDU structure being passed, "snapshot" all or part of the IDU and
	  write the snapshot to a buffer or log file
	
	- Pass control to the original SAP entry point
	
	If the data flow problem is due to an errant layer entity (passing
	incorrect or incorrectly formatted ICI information, "freezing up,"
	etc.), an examination of the log generated by the interface trace
	utility should reveal the cause of the problem. An example of a
	vertical interface trace utility used for LAN Manager troubleshooting
	is the NBTRAP (NetBIOS interface trace) utility.
	
	PEER PROTOCOL TRACE UTILITIES
	
	A specially configured computer can connect to the physical medium to
	receive and examine all frames sent to and from specified network
	addresses. If you set the computer software to display frame header
	information at any selected functional layer, then you can examine
	peer protocol conversations between selected stations to see if the
	data flow problem is due to peer protocol errors. An example of a peer
	protocol trace utility is the Sniffer from Network General.
