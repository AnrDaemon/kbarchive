	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you compress a floptical disk, DoubleSpace restarts the system.
	
	This problem occurs because DoubleSpace treats a floptial drive (an optical drive
	with removable disks) like a hard disk drive, not a floppy drive.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 6.2. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
