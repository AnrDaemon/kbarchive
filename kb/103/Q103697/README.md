	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.1, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to import a backed-up Mail message file (MMF) into version 3.0b,
	3.1, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, Mail asks you how to handle duplicate
	messages. If you choose Save All Messages, Mail copies messages from the
	imported MMF file except for those that are duplicates with the same
	modification date.
	
	This may be confusing because some messages from the MMF file will be copied into
	the destination folder, while others may not.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
