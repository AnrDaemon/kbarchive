	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A gateway, when used in conjunction with electronic mail systems, is designed to
	connect two or more dissimilar mail systems. For example, a gateway that links
	dissimilar mail systems A and B, sends and receives messages from each mail
	system using the protocols associated it.
	
	The gateway changes all the protocols necessary between the two mail systems, but
	it does not change the actual data being sent: what you send is what is received
	by the destination mail system.
	
	A gateway cannot always provide every service requested by a mail system because
	it is limited by the services available at the other mail system. For example,
	one mail system may support registered mail. When it sends a registered mail
	message through the gateway to another mail system, that receiving mail system
	must be able support registered mail. If it does not, registered mail cannot be
	used when communicating with this mail system.
