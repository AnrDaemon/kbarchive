	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	VM user addresses can be created within the Admin program, or each user can
	create personal addresses within the mail client program. This is possible
	because of the general-delivery feature of the gateway, which allows MS Mail
	users to send mail to any user on any VM node.
	
	Within the Admin program, VM addresses are created in two stages:
	
	1. The administrator defines the VM node in the Gateway/PROFS/Nodes section of
	  the Admin program.
	
	2. From the Nodes menu, the administrator chooses the List function and adds
	  specific users' addresses to the node.
	
	Within the mail client programs, VM addresses are added to the user's personal
	address list in two ways:
	
	1. The MS Mail user can browse and add names from the list of existing VM users
	  in the PROFS menu.
	
	2. The MS Mail user can add new VM user addresses from scratch, taking advantage
	  of the general-delivery feature.
