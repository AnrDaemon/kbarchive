	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If offline operation is invoked in version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for the
	Macintosh, a password is required by the workstation. Provided a local file for
	the designated user exists, the user-entered password is checked against the
	password contained in that local file. The local file is created if the offline
	operation preference has been selected and at least one login with the server
	has occurred.
	
	If the password matches, offline operation begins. If the password does not
	match, a dialog box is displayed allowing the user to attempt a connection to
	the server.
