	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Directory Synchronization (DirSync) updates address lists for the PROFS
	gateway(s) defined on any client postoffice included in the DirSync
	transactions.
	
	DirSync automatically propagates any changes made at a client or server
	postoffice to all other client postoffices. This includes changes to the PROFS
	gateway address lists, and all VM addresses included in the Postoffice Address
	List (POL). Import/Export of addresses across the gateway will still be done by
	means of the Admin program.
