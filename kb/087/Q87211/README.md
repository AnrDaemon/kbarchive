	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Within the Admin program, you can define both direct and indirect gateways to
	PROFS. Direct gateways are those that directly access your postoffice; indirect
	gateways are connected to other "downstream" postoffices. Within the mail client
	programs, both types of gateways appear in the PROFS address list, and are not
	discernible from each other.
	
	Normally, there is only one direct gateway installed at a postoffice; however,
	there could be several indirect gateways defined. Mail addressed to users on any
	of these indirect gateways is delivered to the host by means of the External
	program and a downstream postoffice.
