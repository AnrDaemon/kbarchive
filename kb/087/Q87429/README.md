	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can delete both indirect and direct PROFS gateways from a postoffice using
	the Admin program's Delete option. From the Admin program's Gateways menu,
	choose PROFS, choose Gateway, then select Delete.
	
	Using the Delete option in the Admin program does not remove all of the
	gateway-related files from the postoffice database, however. To remove the
	gateway from a database entirely, run the REMOVE.EXE programs shipped with the
	Gateway Access and Gateway components. Running REMOVE.EXE from each of these
	disks restores postoffices to their "pre-gateway" condition.
