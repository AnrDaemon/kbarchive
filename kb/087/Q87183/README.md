	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Two text-file translation programs, ASCII.EXE and EBCDIC.EXE, are supplied with
	the gateway component. You can use them to troubleshoot problems with files that
	are corrupted and therefore copied in the ERR directory.
	
	Detailed information on how to use the programs are included in the "Microsoft
	Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision LAN Administrator's Guide." Briefly,
	the most common use in problem solving is to translate files written in EBCDIC
	format that have been copied into the ERR directory, to determine why the
	gateway program rejected them. Once in ASCII format, the files can be loaded
	into a text editor on a PC and inspected for invalid tokens or formatting
	problems.
