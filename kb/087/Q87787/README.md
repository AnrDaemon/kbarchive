	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If the Microsoft Windows Setup program is running minimized as an icon on the
	Desktop, you will not be able to run any other Windows-based program named
	"Setup." This will occur regardless of whether the MS-DOS file- sharing program
	SHARE.EXE is loaded.
	
	Windows 3.0
	-----------
	
	If the Windows Setup program is minimized, and you try to run a Windows- based
	program named "Setup," the minimized Windows Setup program runs instead. This
	problem occurs when you double-click the other Setup file in File Manager, and
	when you choose Run from the File menu and specify the path to the other Setup
	program in the Command Line text box.
	
	Windows 3.1
	-----------
	
	If the Windows Setup program is minimized, and you try to run a Windows program
	named "Setup," the error message, "Cannot start more than one copy of the
	specified program" appears.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Close the copy of the Windows Setup program that is running minimized on the
	Desktop before running the second program named "Setup."
