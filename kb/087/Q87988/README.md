	When printing appointments from the Calendar program in Windows, there
	is an option to print the current time as a header or a footer. The
	time will only print in the 24-hour format (or military time). For
	example, 2:15 PM would print as 14:15:00.
	
	This is by design because this function doesn't display AM or PM.
	
	NOTE: The time will NOT appear in 24-hour format when printing from
	Notepad or Cardfile.
	
	Additional query words: 3.10 minutes hours seconds hrs 24 hour
