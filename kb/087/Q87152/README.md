	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for the Macintosh, there is a hidden local
	Wastebasket, as well as a server Wastebasket. There can only be one visible
	wastebasket folder at one time. It will represent the union of local and server
	Wastebaskets. When the workstation is offline, the Wastebasket only shows local
	Wastebasket contents. If a connection exists, the visible wastebasket consists
	of the merged contents of the server and local wastebaskets.
	
	The Wastebasket folder cannot be deleted. A delete action will empty the folder.
