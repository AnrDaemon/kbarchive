	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In order to install the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision,
	you must have the Microsoft Mail Server version 2.1 or later installed on your
	local area network (LAN).
	
	The gateway also requires a dedicated IBM-compatible PC/XT/AT with 640K of RAM.
	This gateway PC will use a 3270 emulation program to communicate with the VM
	side of the gateway. For version 3.0 of the gateway, the 3270 card installed in
	the gateway PC should support one of these 3270 APIs:
	
	  IBM High Level
	  IBM Low Level
	  DCA CUT-mode
	  DCA non-CUT (DFT)
	  Novell NetWare 3270
	  Microsoft Comm Server 1.1, with the DCA-DFT emulation API
