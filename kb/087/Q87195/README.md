	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The PC running the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision should
	have a minimum 640K of RAM. Extended or expanded memory is not used by the
	gateway program (HostDisp or VMGATE); however, it can be used to load MS-DOS,
	network drivers, and so forth.
	
	The largest version of the gateway program requires approximately 215K of RAM.
	Therefore, there should be at least this much memory free before running
	HostDisp or VMGATE.
