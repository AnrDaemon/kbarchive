	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If a Microsoft Mail for the Macintosh, version 3.1, server is not available
	during a login session and the user elects offline operation, the workstation
	continues to look for a server in the background. If the workstation detects an
	available connection to the server, a dialog box is displayed to alert the user.
	The dialog box advises that the mail server is now available and the user may
	close and sign out, then restart mail to begin an online operation.
	
	The dialog box will only be presented once per offline session.
