	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use IBM Quickwriter 5204 printer driver version 1.0 supplied with
	Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the driver does not print correctly when the
	Paper Size setting in Control Panel printer setup is set to US Standard Fanfold
	14 7/8 x 11 inch. Windows-based applications print only halfway across the page.
	Nothing is printed on the right side of the page.
	
	Instead of wrapping or continuing to the next line, the driver omits all printing
	that would normally extend beyond the middle of the page. Although the page is
	14 7/8 inches wide, the output contains text only on the left half of the page.
	
	NOTE: Applications that have print preview capability also display a print area
	of only half a page.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of this driver
	included with Windows 3.1. The problem was corrected in version 1.1 of the
	driver.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
