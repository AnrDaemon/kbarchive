	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	It is possible to backbone over SMTP. Backboning is where one organization has
	one office in location A and another office in location B and mail is exchanged
	mail between the two locations using SMTP as the mechanism. Any postoffice can
	submit mail to a postoffice at the other location through its respective
	gateway.
	
	For example, there may be five postoffices on a local-area network (LAN) in
	location A and another five on a LAN in location B, with one postoffice as a
	gateway postoffice in each location and the remaining postoffices as downstream
	SMTP postoffices.
	
	Backboning and its setup requirements are discussed in the "Backbone Mail"
	section in Chapter 3 of the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP Administrator's
	Guide."
