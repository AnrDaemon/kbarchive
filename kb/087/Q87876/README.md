	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Attachmate technical support has confirmed that starting any application after
	Extra for Windows version 3.3 has been started may produce the following error
	message:
	
	  Insufficient memory to run this application.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This error may be due to corrupt layout files in the Extra for Windows

	To determine if the error is caused by corrupt layout files, start Extra for
	Windows with the 3270 icon that is created when Extra is installed (this will
	bypass all layout files). If the error message does not occur, the problem is
	being caused by Attachmate's layout files.
