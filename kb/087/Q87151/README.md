	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	During the creation of a folder in Mail for the Macintosh, version 3.1, users
	are given the option of storing individual folders locally or on the server.
	When you choose the New Folder command, a dialog box is presented. The dialog
	box has a user-definable field for specification of the new folder name and two
	option buttons labeled "on the mail server" and "on this computer (locally)."
	You can select the option based on the desired location of the folder.
	
	If one or the other of the folder location options has been prohibited by the
	Network Manager, then the appropriate option button will be unavailable. It is
	possible for both options to be unavailable. The default selection for folder
	storage selection is initially the server if both options are available. After
	the first selection, the option button will be "sticky."
	
	All folders will be listed in alphabetical order in the Mail summary window
	regardless of their location.
	
	NOTE: Mail for the Macintosh, version 3.0 clients accessing a version 3.1 server
	will not be allowed to create local folders.
