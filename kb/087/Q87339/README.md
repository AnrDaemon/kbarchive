	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows Far East Software Development Kit (FESDK) for Windows version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	During the process of installing the Chinese version of Microsoft Windows
	3.0 from the Far East Software Development Kit (FESDK) CD-ROM (compact-disk
	read-only memory), one of the first screens in the Setup program prompts
	the user to confirm the hardware and software components.
	
	Verify that the listed components match the computer, especially the
	display. The default setting is "VGA with Chinese Eten System Support." To
	install Chinese Windows on a VGA monitor without an Eten system, be sure to
	specify the "VGA" option.
