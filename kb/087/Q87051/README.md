	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The workstation that runs the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI must be a dedicated
	PC with a modem. The gateway transmits mail items between Microsoft Mail and
	MCI.
	
	The gateway picks up mail items from Microsoft Mail, dials MCI, logs in, and
	passes the mail items to MCI. The gateway then downloads any mail waiting in its
	MCI account, disconnects, and distributes the downloaded mail to the appropriate
	Microsoft Mail users.
