	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If new mail is created during an offline session in version 3.1 of Microsoft
	Mail for the Macintosh, it is stored in the Outbox folder. When a user begins an
	online session with their mail server, a dialog box is displayed. The dialog box
	advises that there are outgoing messages in the Outbox and asks if the user
	wants to send them now. If Yes is selected, the messages are sent immediately
	while displaying a status bar. If No is selected, the outgoing queue is not
	affected.
	
	If any messages were incorrectly addressed during an offline session, they are
	returned by the server as undeliverable.
