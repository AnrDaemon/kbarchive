	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you select a two-dimensional (non-line) object in Microsoft PowerPoint, the
	selected object is surrounded by a fuzzy gray rectangle. This is called a
	selection box. The corners of the selection box are resize handles. You can use
	these handles to stretch, shrink, or reproportion the object.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the selected object is not a PowerPoint object or group, it will not be
	surrounded by a selection box. This is a visual indication that the object is
	not a PowerPoint object or group.
	
	Objects that are not PowerPoint objects or groups include the following:
	
	- Embedded or linked objects (such as charts, movies, and so on)
	
	
	- Imported graphics (using the Insert Picture, Paste, or Paste Special
	  commands)
	
	An item created with the tools on the tool palette (with the exception of
	Microsoft Graph objects) is a PowerPoint object. Also, any collection of objects
	that has been grouped together using the Group command is considered a
	PowerPoint group, and will be surrounded by a selection box.
