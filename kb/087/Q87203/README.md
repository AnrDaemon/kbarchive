	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The LAN administrator of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and
	OfficeVision must make sure that the gateway PC always has the correct
	date/time, as this information is used to "stamp" every mail item passing
	through the gateway.
	
	For mail coming from the host to the LAN, this date/time stamp determines where
	the item is displayed in your mailbag. For example, if a host mail item was
	delivered to your mailbag, but it was date-stamped incorrectly, it could end up
	at the bottom of your mailbag. If you have many items in your mailbag, you may
	never see the new piece of host mail.
	
	The same scenario is possible when sending a message from MS Mail to a host user.
	The host user may not be aware of the receipt of a new PROFS note or a new file
	in the Reader.
