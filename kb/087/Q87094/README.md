	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you have a CD-ROM drive that uses the Trantor TSLCDR.SYS driver, and CDAudio
	is chosen from the Media Player Device menu, the thumb tab on the scroll bar
	will not seek properly. If the thumb tab is advanced by dragging it or by using
	the arrows on the scroll bar, the tab will return to the beginning of the scroll
	bar as soon as it is released, and no seek feature will be performed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To have the Media Player perform a seek on a CDAudio disc with the TSLCDR.SYS
	driver, press the Play button first. The thumb tab will then allow the seek
	feature to work properly.
	
	
	For more information on updates of the TSLCDR.SYS driver, contact the vendor of
	the CD-ROM drive.
	
	TSLCDR.SYS is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
	warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
