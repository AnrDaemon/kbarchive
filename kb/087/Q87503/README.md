	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print an envelope on a HP LaserJet series printer, the trailing edge
	(right side) of the return address may be smudged or smeared.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by air pockets created within the envelope as it travels
	through the paper feed mechanism. This problem does not occur on HP PostScript
	printers.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, set at least one-third of an inch margins on the
	top and trailing edges of the envelope.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The phenomenon known as a "37 millimeter smudge" can cause text or graphics
	close to the trailing edge of an envelope to be smeared. The air pockets that
	cause the problem always exist, but only cause problems when you try to print on
	the trailing edge of an envelope, such as printing a return address. The air
	pockets force the trailing edge of the envelope to flutter, which causes a
	disruption in the static charge during the printing of the return address. This
	disruption often produces a smearing effect.
	
	
	HP Technical Support has confirmed this to be a problem with all laser printers
	that feed envelopes with the left side as the trailing edge. For more
	information about this issue, call HP Technical Support.
