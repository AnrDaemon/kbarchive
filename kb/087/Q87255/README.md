	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you are running version 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
	Networks along with version 2.1 of LAN Manager, when you use the LAN Manager
	commands Macfile and Macprint to print a document to a Hewlett-Packard (HP)
	LaserJet IIIsi printer, some documents will be partially printed or will not
	print at all.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, contact Hewlett-Packard to have the laser printer
	updated. The printer problem can be corrected with a firmware datecode of V6.4R,
	an internal font datecode of V3.01, and a PostScript device-specific revision of
	300.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
