	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Mail system itself does not limit the size of an attachment file
	that can be created. Outside factors can prevent the creation of a large
	attachment file:
	
	- Hardware limitations: There might not be enough hard disk space to store a
	  large attachment file.
	
	- User configuration limitations: There may be a file size limit set on a
	  user's network ID so that large files cannot be created.
