	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, you can access commands quickly by using
	gestures. These gestures are similar to shortcut keys, and can be used for
	cutting, copying, pasting, and user-defined functions.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some ideas of possible user-defined gestures are:
	
	1. Inserting specific text (similar to a glossary entry) into a document.
	
	2. Carrying out specific functions that you use frequently -- such as saving or
	  printing a document.
	
	To produce a gesture using Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, use your pen to
	draw the appropriate symbol. Commands such as Cut, Copy Paste, and Undo use
	common grammatical gestures, whereas user-defined gestures commonly use a letter
	enclosed in a circle.
	
	Gestures can be defined for use exclusively with one application or system-wide.
	Multiple users can save specific configuration information that can be loaded
	when that person is using the computer; however, this feature is not available
	when creating user-defined gestures to carry out specific tasks.
	
	User-defined gestures are controlled by the Gesture Manager, which is accessed
	through the Pen Palette (PENPAL.EXE). The Gesture Manager allows you to assign a
	gesture to either a series of keystrokes or to a string of text. PENPAL.EXE
	should be loaded automatically every time you start Microsoft Windows for Pen
	Computing.
	
	User-defined gestures are saved in the PENWIN.INI file. Those gestures defined
	for use system-wide are in a section titled [sysges] and those for specific
	applications are in that application's title, for example [TERMINAL].
