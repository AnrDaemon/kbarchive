	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There are two types of folders that allow storage in version 3.1 of Microsoft
	Mail for the Macintosh -- these are classified as local folders and server
	folders.
	
	Server folders allow for filing and storage of mail on the mail server's disk
	drive. Local folders allow for filing and storage of mail on the local user's
	disk drive.
	
	Both local and server folder storage can be enabled or disabled by the server
	Network Manager. If either option is disabled, the option is unavailable in the
	folder creation screen.
	
	Server folders are depicted by a simple folder outline. Local folders are
	depicted by a simple folder outline with a black folder tab.
	
	NOTE: Server folders do not appear in the mail summary screen during offline
	operation.
