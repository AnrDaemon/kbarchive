	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The GROUP.GLB file contains the postoffice group names that are maintained in
	the Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE) under the Local-Admin Group menu (from
	ADMIN.EXE, Local-Admin menu, choose Group). These groups are available to all
	local postoffice users. External postoffice users also have the ability to
	address mail to this group name.
	
	The GROUP.GLB file contains only the group alias name and not the actual members
	of the group. The member names are contained in the ADMIN.GRP file.
	
	The group can contain any valid mail address, including gateways. It is not
	limited to Microsoft Mail addresses.
