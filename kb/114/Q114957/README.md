	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Fine Artist prints in Landscape orientation only. It is not possible to print in
	Portrait orientation from Fine Artist.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Although it is possible to go to the Control Room (by pressing "CTRL+SHIFT+A"
	(without the quotation marks) or "COMMAND+SHIFT+A" (without the quotation
	marks)) and change the paper orientation to Portrait, Fine Artist always
	defaults back to Landscape and prints in Landscape. This is by design.
