	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Each product suggestion is read by a member of our product feedback team,
	classified for easy access, and routed to the product or service team to drive
	Microsoft product and/or service improvements. Because we receive an abundance
	of suggestions (over 69,000 suggestions a year!) we can't guarantee that each
	request makes it into a final product or service. But we can tell you that each
	suggestion has been received and is being reviewed by the team that is most
	capable of addressing it.
	
	All product or service suggestions received become the sole property of
	Microsoft. Should a suggestion be implemented, Microsoft is under no obligation
	to provide compensation.
