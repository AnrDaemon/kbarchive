	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In versions 3.0 through 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, a shared folder can
	be created inside of a shared folder that is set to have read-only access. The
	existence of this subfolder prevents the owner of the top-level shared folder
	from being able to delete the folder.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 through 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
