	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You start MSN Explorer and then sign in. You click the E-mail button in the top
	toolbar, and then resize the window so that the links to Free Newsletters and
	Special Links are no longer visible in the upper-right corner of the window. You
	press TAB repeatedly until you have selected the Free Newsletters link. Even
	though the information on the E-mail screen is too wide to fit in the window, a
	horizontal scroll bar does not appear at the bottom of the window.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known issue.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you want to return to the left-most section of the E-mail window, press TAB
	two more times. This will select the Show Folders button and allow you to view
	the left section of the e-mail window. This issue will be resolved in a future
	release of MSN Explorer.
