	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the support guidelines for the System Stress Utility for
	Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, which was first distributed to MSDN
	Professional and Universal subscribers in the January 2000 version, on disc 12
	of the Development Platform English pack.
	
	A brief overview of the System Stress Utility is on the CD-ROM under
	.\Docs\stressCD.html. There is no formal documentation. This tool is unsupported
	by Microsoft Technical Support, but you can e-mail bug reports to:
	
	  WHQLSYS@microsoft.com
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The System Stress Utility tests hardware under stress conditions. Most tests
	involve running the utility for 48 hours. The utility sets up kernel mode
	debugging in order to debug any hardware failures that happen during that time.
	If there are no crashes or "blue screens" during the 48 hours, the hardware
	"passes" the tests.
