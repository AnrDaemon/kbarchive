	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you use Outlook with the Journaling feature enabled, many entries may
	accumulate in the Journal folder. If you disable the Journaling feature, these
	items are still listed in the Journal folder.
	
	To clear these entries from the Journal folder you need to manually delete them.
	The Journal folder is displayed as a timeline by default. This can make it
	difficult to select multiple items or to delete all of the Journal entries at
	one time.
