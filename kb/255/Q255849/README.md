	contacts.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To set up public folder journaling for public folder contacts:
	
	1. Create both a Contacts and a Journal public folder.
	
	2. In the properties of the Contacts public folder, click the Activities tab,
	  click New, and then find the Journal public folder that you created in step 1
	  and select it. Click OK.
	
	3. Create a new journal entry in the Journal public folder, click Contact on the
	  bottom left, and then choose a contact from the Contacts public folder that
	  you created in step 1.
	
	4. After you save the journal entry, open the contact and click the Activities
	  tab. The journal entry is listed there. The autojournal feature is only
	  available for personal mailboxes.
	
	NOTE: For Contacts public folders, you can include only one folder in each
	Activities group. For example, you cannot set up an Activities group that
	includes both a Journal public folder and a Client Calendar public folder.
