## Q228802: MS RPC Incorrect Behavior for Frame Following Maybe Frame

	Article: Q228802
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A "dg RPC Request (maybe)" remote procedure call (RPC) frame is sent out from a
	client as a Maybe request. This may mean that the server is not obligated to
	respond to such a frame. However, the Microsoft RPC runtime sends out a
	subsequent "dg RPC Ack:" frame with the same sequence number. From the
	connectionless protocol data unit (PDU) definitions of the Distributed Computing
	Environment (DCE) specification:
	
	  "A client sends an ACK PDU after it has received a response to an
	  at-most-once request".
