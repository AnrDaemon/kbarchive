	Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
	posting to scan this file for viruses. After it is posted, the file is housed on
	secure servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.
	
	NOTE You can use MASM 6.14 to develop applications that run under MS-DOS or
	Windows 3.1x, but the assembler (ml.exe) requires Windows 9x, or Windows NT. If
	you need to use MASM on an MS-DOS or Windows 3.1x machine, version 6.11d is the
	latest version capable of running under these operating systems. A patch to
	update version 6.11 to version 6.11d can be obtained by contacting Microsoft
	Product Support at
	
	  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS
	  (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS)
	
	The files provided in ML614.exe do not patch MASM version 6.11c, which was made
	available only in the Windows NT version 3.5 DDK and Windows 95 DDK, in the form
	of the files ML.exe and ML.err. You must replace these two files with their
	version 6.11 counterparts prior to installing the 6.14 patch. You can reinstall
	the ML.exe and ML.err files for MASM version 6.11 from the original disks. To do
	this, select Copy a File From the Distribution Disks from Setup's Main menu and
	specify ML.exe and ML.err.
	
	MASM 6.11 is no longer available as a retail product. There are currently two
	ways to obtain MASM 6.11:
	
	1. As a fulfillment option for Visual C++, if you have a registered copy of
	  Visual C++, you can contact Microsoft at 1-800-360-7561 to obtain a copy of
	  MASM 6.11 for the cost of shipping & handling. The supplemental part
	  number is 016-051-S02.
	
	2. MASM 6.11 is included with some levels of the Microsoft Developer Network
	  (MSDN). You can order MSDN by contacting Microsoft Sales and Service at
	  1-800-426-9400.
