## Q228543: Policy Editor Does Not Read SNMP Communities Correctly

	Article: Q228543
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0 SP4
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix
	Last Modified: 16-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) communities are enhanced in Windows NT
	4.0 Service Pack 4 to include permissions for communities. Policy Editor
	(Poledit.exe) cannot read these permissions or community names correctly because
	of changes made in the registry to support community security.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Because Policy Editor reads all of the necessary registry entries at startup and
	then writes all of the entries when saved, whether the entry was changed or not,
	the SNMP configuration information was removed from Policy Editor to prevent the
	SNMP communities from being written in the previous format and because the SNMP
	configuration is not a policy.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
