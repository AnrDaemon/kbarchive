	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Spine: Text Correction
	----------------------
	
	Change:
	"MSCE"
	To:
	"MCSE"
	
	
	Page 49: Question 70-098.02.02.004 Correction
	---------------------------------------------
	
	On Page 49, in question 70-098.02.02.004, the question should be revised so that
	the answer for "A" applies.
	
	Change the last sentence in the question from:
	"How must Tom's computers be configured to allow Tom access to his work computer
	from his home computer?"
	
	To:
	"How must Tom's work computer be configured to allow Tom access to it from his
	home computer?"
	
	This change should take place on page 49 and 50.
	
	
	Page 69: Question 70-098.02.03.011 Answer "D" Should Be Incorrect
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 69, the answer to Question 70-098.02.03.011 should be "C" and "F".
	
	When Client for Netware Networks is installed, it automatically installs IPX/SPX
	so you do not have to install it again seperately. This can be verified by
	looking at page 66 in the answer for 70-098.02.03.007, option A.
	
	Change "D" from:
	"Correct. Netware networks use the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol."
	
	To:
	"Incorrect. Netware networks use the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, but when you
	install Client for NetWare Networks, the IPX/SPX protocol will be installed
	automatically."
	
	
	Page 98: Question 70-098.02.06.002 Answer "D" Is Incorrect
	----------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 98, the correct answers for question 70-098.02.06.002 are A and C.
	
	Change answer D from:
	"D. Correct. Windows 98 supports restoring MS-DOS backups."
	
	To:
	"D. Incorrect. Windows 98 does not support restoring MS-DOS backups."
	
	
	Page 104: Using Microsoft Backup, Practice 2 Is Incorrect
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 104, under "Using Microsoft Backup", Practice 2 states the same practice
	exercise as Practice 2 in Configuring a local printer.
	
	Under "Using Microsoft Backup" delete: "Practice 2: Share the printer for network
	use. Try connecting to this printer and printing a test page."
	
	The following practice exercises should suffice:
	
	- Manually install Microsoft Backup on a Windows 98 computer.
	
	- Create a New backup job using the Backup Wizard.
	
	- Restore the backup job using the Restore Wizard.
	
	- Perform a backup and restore without using the Wizards.
	
	
	Page 146: Question 70-98.03.05.001 Cluster Size Incorrect
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 146, in question 70-98.03.05.001, the cluster size for FAT 32, in answer
	"D" is incorrect.
	
	Change:
	"D. Incorrect. FAT32 uses 32-KB clusters, so by upgrading to FAT32 you would be
	implementing 32-KB, not 8-KB, clusters."
	
	To:
	"D. Incorrect. FAT32 uses 4-KB clusters on a drive smaller than 8 gig, so by
	upgrading to FAT32 you would be implementing 4-KB, not 8-KB, clusters."
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
