	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Midtown Madness, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you drive the Panoz GTR-1, you may experience the following symptoms when
	you attempt to hop a curb:
	
	- If you hit the curb at a steep angle, the GTR-1 is damaged, and the vehicle
	  may stop unexpectedly.
	
	  NOTE: If you hit the curb at a speed of 50 miles-per-hour (MPH) or greater,
	  you may destroy the Panoz GTR-1.
	
	- If you hit the curb at a shallow angle, the GTR-1 is slightly damaged, and
	  the vehicle may bounce off the curb and remain on the street.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the Panoz GTR-1 has an extremely low ground
	clearance and is not designed to handle street curbs and other large bumps.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent this behavior from occurring, use crosswalk ramps to hop the curb, or
	drive only on the street.
