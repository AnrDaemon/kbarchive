	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run a Checkpoint Race in Microsoft Midtown Madness, the finish line may
	not appear on the screen, even though your opponents are stopped where the
	finish line should be displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you miss a checkpoint in the race.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use the directional arrow that is displayed on the
	upper-middle portion of the game screen to drive to the checkpoint you missed,
	and then return to the finish line.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Because you do not have to follow a specific route in Midtown Madness Checkpoint
	Races, you can pass the race checkpoints in any order you want. However, you are
	not notified if you miss a particular checkpoint.
