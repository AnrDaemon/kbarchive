	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	While you are playing a game on Zone.com, your computer may be disconnected from
	the Internet.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if your modem or Internet connection settings are
	configured to disconnect your computer from the Internet when your connection is
	idle for a certain length of time.
	
	While you are playing a game on Zone.com, your modem or Web browser may not
	monitor game-related network activity when it attempts to determine if your
	connection is idle.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, disable the automatic disconnection feature, or increase
	the length of time for which the connection must be idle before the computer is
	disconnected from the Internet. To do this, use one of the following methods.
