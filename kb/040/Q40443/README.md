	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Page 60 of the "Microsoft Flight Simulator" version 3.00 manual incorrectly
	states that the type of aircraft is saved in a user mode. This is a
	documentation error. Flight mode files do not save the type of aircraft in
	version 3.00.
	
	A summary of the information saved in a flight mode may be listed from within
	Flight Simulator by pressing 1, F, 8 (Mode Report).
	
	Saving aircraft type with a flight mode was a new feature added in Flight
	Simulator version 4.00.
