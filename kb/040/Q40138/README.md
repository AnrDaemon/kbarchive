	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When using the ILS landing feature in Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00,
	three marker beacons (outer, middle, and inner) are located along the approach
	to the ILS runway. Each beacon should emit a tone and light an indicator on the
	instrument panel when you fly in the vicinity of the beacon. However, the inner
	beacon (closest to the runway) does neither.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator versions 3.00
	and 4.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as
	it becomes available.
