## Q40575: Norton's Guide Hangs QuickC Version 2.00

{% raw %}

	Article: Q40575
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 2.00   | 2.00
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS | OS/2
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | buglist2.00 | mspl13_c

	Peter Norton Computing produces a TSR called The Norton Guides
	(NG.EXE) that provides online help for many programming issues.
	Pressing the hotkey to invoke this utility, while you are in the
	QuickC Version 2.00 environment, activates Norton's pop-up window.
	However, further keystokes are futile. Your system hangs and rebooting
	is the only solution.
	
	The workaround is to avoid invoking the Norton Guide from within
	QuickC 2.00.  Invoking the Guide outside of QuickC 2.00's environment
	is not a problem.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 2.00. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information as it becomes
	available.
