	  Part Number  Display Type  Size         Maximum Resolution
	                            (in Inches)
	  ----------------------------------------------------------
	  8503         Monochrome    12            640 x 480 (VGA)
	  8506         Monochrome    17            848 x 1200 (PS/2 IA)
	  8507         Monochrome    19           1024 x 768 (8514)
	  8508         Monochrome    19           1600 x 1200 (PS/2 IA)
	  8512         Color         14            640 x 480 (VGA)
	  8513         Color         12            640 x 480 (VGA)
	  8514         Color         16           1024 x 768 (8514)
	  8604         Monochrome    15           1024 x 768 (8514)
	
	NOTE: "Maximum Resolution" assumes the monitor is being used with a display card
	of the proper capability. PS/2 Models 25 and 30 are equipped with MCGA. A
	resolution of 1024 x 768 requires the IBM 8514/A display adapter. The 8506 and
	8508 adapters require the IBM Personal System/2 Image Adapter/A.

	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
	performance or reliability.
