	There is no variable-name cross-reference facility provided with
	QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, 4.50, Microsoft BASIC Compiler
	Version 6.00 or 6.00b, or Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00. Variables
	in BASIC are not public symbols, so they do not show up in the
	linker's .MAP file.
	
	You can write or obtain a utility that analyzes the source file and
	displays a cross-reference listing.
	
	According to the "Language Support Directory for Microsoft QuickBASIC
	and Microsoft BASIC Compiler" (a pamphlet that comes with QuickBASIC
	Version 4.50 and Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b),
	the following company offers a product called Source Print, which
	gives a cross-reference list showing where variables are used and
	where functions, procedures, and routines are called:
	
	   Aldebaran Laboratories, Inc.
	   3339 Vincent Road
	   Pleasant Hill, CA  94523
	   (415) 930-8966
	
	   Product: Source Print
	   Price: $97
	
	Other companies may also offer a cross-reference program for the BASIC
	language.
