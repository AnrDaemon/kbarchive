	When either MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS is loaded using a serial mouse on
	some of the ATT 6300's, the machine will hang.
	
	You can correct this problem by specifying the COM port the mouse is
	attached to by using the /C1 or /C2 command-line switches. You can do
	this either in a manual start up or by including the information in
	the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files.
