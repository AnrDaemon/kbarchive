## Q40810: _edata and _end Are Defined by LINK

{% raw %}

	Article: Q40810
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 5.10   | 5.10
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS | OS/2
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | S_LINK | mspl13_c

	Question :
	
	In the map file generated by Microsoft LINK, there are two symbols:
	_edata and _end. What are they?
	
	Response:
	
	When the /DOSSEG (default) option is used with the LINK command, these
	two symbols are created by LINK and are used in the C startup code as
	markers. They are only meaningful for the Microsoft C and FORTRAN
	Compilers.
	
	This information is explained on Page 273 of the "Microsoft CodeView
	and Utilities Software Development Tools for the MS-DOS Operating
	System" manual for C Version 5.00 or 5.10 in the LINK section. The
	note on this page states that the _edata points to the beginning of
	the BSS segment; _end points to the end of the BSS segment and the
	beginning of the STACK segment.
	
	These two symbols can be found in the startup source code file
	CRT0.ASM. The startup source code is included in the Microsoft C
	Optimizing Compiler for Versions 5.00 and 5.10.
