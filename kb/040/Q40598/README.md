	The Microsoft HELPMAKE utility interprets a backslash (\) as a
	formatting flag. If you want to display a backslash in the online
	help, you must type two successive backslashes (\\). The first
	backslash is interpreted; the second is displayed.
	
	For further information on formatting flags, refer to the HELPMAKE
	documentation in the utilities manual, or the online help supplied
	with your particular compiler.
