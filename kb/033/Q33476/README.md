	AutoCAD contains its own mouse driver; therefore, it does not need to
	have the Microsoft Mouse Driver installed to take advantage of the
	Microsoft Mouse. If the Microsoft Mouse Driver is installed, it may
	cause a TSR-type error when AutoCAD is run.
	
	AutoCAD problems can be directed to Autodesk by calling (415)
	332-2344.
