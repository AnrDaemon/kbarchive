	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to set up MSN Broadband powered by Qwest for
	Macintosh computers with both Mac OS 9.2 and Mac OS X installed. MSN Broadband
	software is designed to work with Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x only. This article describes
	how to set up a newer model Macintosh computer equipped with both Mac OS 9.2 and
	Mac OS X for use with MSN Broadband.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The minimum computer system requirements for MSN Broadband for Macintosh
	computers are as follows:
	
	- PowerPC Macintosh computer (G3 or higher recommended)
	
	- 32 MB of RAM (64 MB or more recommended)
	
	- Mac OS 8.6 or later, not including Mac OS X
	
	- 32 MB of available hard-disk space
	
	- CD-ROM drive
	
	- Ethernet port
	
	- Video resolution of 800 x 600 or higher running thousands of colors
	  (resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher recommended)
	
	- 28.8 Kbps or higher modem (optional, required only for dial-up connections)
	
	The MSN Broadband powered by Qwest software supports Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x only. The
	MSN Broadband software will not install on a Macintosh computer that is running
	OS X.
	However, because new Macintosh computers come standard with both Mac OS 9.2 and
	OS X, MSN Broadband can be installed, provided the computer is running OS 9.2
	when installing the MSN Broadband software.
	
	To install MSN Broadband on a Macintosh computer running Mac OS 9.2
	
	1. Locate your MSN Broadband Installation Guide included in your Welcome Kit.
	
	2. Follow all setup instructions as described on pages 15 to 21.
	
	3. On page 22, when instructed to start your computer, make sure to start it
	  using Mac OS 9.2.
	
	4. Follow all setup instructions as provided from page 22 on in the guide.
	  To use MSN Broadband and Outlook Express, make sure to start up your computer
	  using Mac OS 9.2.
	
	Configuring Your DSL Modem for MSN Broadband While Running Mac OS X
	
	It is possible to configure your modem to work with MSN Broadband while running
	Mac OS X. However, because the MSN Broadband software will not install on a
	Macintosh computer running Mac OS X, using MSN Broadband with Mac OS requires
	manual configuration of the DSL modem. In addition, setting up your modem and
	computer manually to use Msn Broadband does not permit installation of the
	following applications included on the MSN Broadband CD-ROM.
	
	- Internet Browser (IE) 5.1 for Macintosh
	
	- MSN Messenger 2.1 for Macintosh
	
	- Outlook Express 5.0.4 for Macintosh
	
	For these reasons, using MSN Broadband with Mac OS X is not recommended.
	
	If you choose to install MSN Broadband with Mac OS X, be aware of the following:
	
	- To use IE 5.1 for Macintosh: IE 5.1 comes bundled with Mac OS X systems and
	  is already included in your system programs.
	
	- To use MSN Messenger 2.1 for Macintosh: MSN Messenger can be downloaded for
	  free from http://www.microsoft.com/mac/messenger.
	
	- To send and receive e-mail: Outlook Express (OE) is not compatible with Mac
	  OS X. Microsoft Entourage, which comes bundled with Microsoft Office X for
	  Macintosh, is the only e-mail program compatible for use with MSN Broadband.
	  If you install MSN Broadband with Mac OS X and you do not have Microsoft
	  Entourage, you cannot use your @msn e-mail address to send and receive
	  e-mail.
	
	For more information about using Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and Microsoft
	Entourage with MSN Broadband, visit http://www.helpdesk.msn.com/.

	  If both display steady green lights, your modem has successfully established
	  an active connection to the Internet.

	  signed up for MSN Internet Access.
	  Final configuration settings will now be downloaded to your DSL modem. This
	  process will take several minutes. Do not proceed until the Final
	  Configuration page asks you to click Continue.
	
	20. Click Continue.
	  If a message appears and asks if you want to close the Internet Explorer
	  window, click Yes.
	  Note: If the LAN light blinks steadily, your modem has not been successfully
	  configured. Start Internet Explorer, and then type
	  https://cpeconfig.dsl.msn.com in the address bar to configure your modem. If
	  the LAN light does not appear, refer to the Troubleshooting Installation and
	  Setup chapter in the MSN Broadband Installation Guide.
	  Configuration is now complete.
