	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
	For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.
	
	MS-DOS-based versions of Lotus 1-2-3 versions 3.x may be unable to correctly
	access floppy disks when SHARE is loaded.
	
	This problem does not occur with Windows-based versions of Lotus 1-2-3.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, do not run SHARE and Lotus 1-2-3 simultaneously
	when you need to access floppy disks.
	
	For more information, contact Lotus.
