	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may notice some focus anomalies in Mozart when the Help or Glossary windows
	are open. For example, if you click the main window or a hotspot (jump) item in
	the main window, Mozart will advance to the next page, but the Help or Glossary
	window will remain open and in front of the main window. The expected behavior
	would be for the Help or Glossary window to be placed behind the main window.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mozart version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. From the main Mozart screen, choose The Instruments.
	
	2. Progress to page 2 of The Instruments. This page contains three photographs,
	  depicting a violin, a cello, and a viola.
	
	3. Press the Help button. The Help window appears, mostly obscuring the main
	  Mozart window.
	
	4. Click the exposed part of the violin picture (the picture on the left).
	
	The main Mozart window switches to page 3, but the Help window stays on top. The
	Help window should move behind the main Mozart window.
	
	This occurs when the pointer is a hand. You may also notice that if you move the
	cursor over the exposed area of a picture, it turns into a hand, and then when
	you move it back over the Help window, it remains a hand instead of reverting to
	an arrow.
