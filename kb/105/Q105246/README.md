	Installing XTree for Windows
	----------------------------
	
	When you install XTree for Windows, you receive a Welcome screen that gives you
	the option to Continue, Exit or view the README file. If you choose to view the
	README file, the file (opened in Notepad) will flicker on the screen for an
	instant and then disappear. In order to view the file, you can press ALT+TAB to
	switch to Notepad-README.TXT, then close it or press ALT+TAB to return to the
	XTree Setup when you have finished viewing the file, or you can press CTRL+ESC
	to bring up the Task List and then Switch to Notepad-README.TXT.
	
	Cannot Install Command Center as the Windows Shell
	--------------------------------------------------
	
	When you install XTree for Windows, you have the option to Convert Program
	Manager groups to CommandBars, customize which CommandBars startup
	automatically, and install the Command Center as the Windows Shell. If you
	choose to Convert Program Manager groups, you will not receive an error message,
	but no groups will be converted. Similarly, when you choose to install the
	Command Center as the Windows Shell, you will not receive an error message, but
	the Command Center will not replace Program Manager as the shell. Windows NT
	uses a 32-bit application, Program Manager, as its shell. Also, if you choose to
	customize which CommandBars load automatically (select Customize Autoload during
	XTree Setup), you will not see any of your groups listed in the list of
	available CommandBars to load automatically.
	
	For additional information, call XTree technical support (Executive Systems) at
	(800) 964-2490.
