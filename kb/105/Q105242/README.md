	The Brother HL-8e may need a firmware update to correctly print
	TrueType fonts from Windows NT. Problems may include dropped or
	garbled characters when printing TrueType fonts.
	
	
	According to Brother's technical support, if the printer firmware is
	dated earlier than 8/92, it should be updated to a version dated at
	least 8/24/92 to correct known problems with TrueType fonts.
	
	Use the following procedure to determine the firmware revision of your
	printer:
	
	1. Power off the printer.
	
	2. Holding the Fonts button down, power up the printer.
	
	3. While still holding the Fonts button, wait until the power up sequence is
	  completed, then the firmware version will be displayed.
	
	For additional information, call Brother technical support at (800)
	276-7746.
	
	
	The HL-8e Printer is manufactured by Brother, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
	products' performance or reliability.
