	With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, a shortcut
	exists for entering a new gateway address with a friendly name into a personal
	address book (PAB).
	
	To add a new gateway address with a friendly name into a PAB
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
	1. Log in to the Mail Windows client. From the Mail menu, choose Options and
	  verify that the Add Recipients To Personal Address Book option is checked.
	
	2. Click the Compose button to compose a message..
	
	3. Enter the friendly name followed by the gateway type and address in brackets
	  on the "To" line. For example, to add someone to your PAB whose friendly name
	  is Paul and whose SMTP address is paul@company.com, you would enter the
	  following on the "To" line:
	
	  Paul[SMTP:paul@company.com]
	
	4. Finish composing the message and click the Send button.
	
	5. The new address will be added to your PAB as soon as the message has left the
