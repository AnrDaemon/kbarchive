	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The System Information window for versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for
	AppleTalk Networks is invoked by holding down the Command, Option, and ? keys
	while logged into mail. The Command+Option+? keystroke will display a window
	with information similar to the following:
	
	             3.1 System Information
	
	   Desk Accessory:
	      Version Number              31001
	
	   Device Driver:
	      Version Number              31001
	      Serial Number        00-067-0311-00000000
	
	   Mail Server:
	      Version Number              3100
	      Serial Number               46100544
	
	   Server Name:
	      Marketing
	
	This information can be helpful when troubleshooting problems stemming from
	mismatched workstation and server mail versions. The above example shows that
	the Microsoft Mail desk accessory and MS Mail chooser extension are both version
	3.1a. The user is currently logged into a version 3.1 mail server called
	"Marketing". If the user had been using version 3.0 workstation software, the
	version number would have been 3000X where X=0 implies that it is version 3.0
	and X=1 implies that it is version 3.0a.
