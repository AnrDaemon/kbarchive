	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, if you want to enter
	addresses directly on the To: line, without first adding them to your Personal
	Address Book (PAB), you should enclose the address in square brackets.
	
	For example, to send mail to a Microsoft Mail user, type the following:
	
	  "[MS:<network>/<postoffice>/<user>]" (without the quotation
	  marks)
	
	To send mail to an AT&T user, type
	
	  "[AT&T:!<user>]" (without the quotation marks)
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Addressing mail to an AT&T Mail user is a unique case, because you must add
	the exclamation point character (!) in the address.
	
	For more information, query on the following words here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base:

	  quotation marks) and "address" (without the quotation marks) and "list"
	  (without the quotation marks)
