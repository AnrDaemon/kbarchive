	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you type "DBLSPACE /DELETE <drive letter>:" (without the quotation
	marks), you receive the following prompt:
	
	  Deleting drive <drive letter> will permanently erase it and all the
	  files it contains. Are you sure you want to delete drive <drive
	  letter>?
	
	Since there is no other prompt (such as "[Y/N]"), the machine appears to stop
	responding (hang).
	
	To answer yes, press Y; to answer no, press N.
	
	NOTE: This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
	DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and
	filenames.
