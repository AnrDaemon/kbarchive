## Q105563: Mozart: Mozart Hangs when Restored from Program Manager Icon

	Article: Q105563

	Version(s): 1.0

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Normally, if Mozart is running but is minimized, you can restore it (maximize it
	again) by clicking the Mozart icon in Program Manager. However, if Mozart has
	received a Windows alert, trying to restore it using this method may cause
	Mozart to stop responding (hang).
	
	This problem may occur if after you receive an alert (any Windows error message
	box with a yellow exclamation mark), you minimize Mozart and try to restore it
	with the Program Manager icon.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mozart version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, don't try to restore Mozart from the icon in Program
	Manager if you have received a Windows error message. Instead, restore Mozart
	either by double-clicking the minimized icon in the lower-left corner of the
	screen, or by using the Task List (press CTRL+ESC).
