	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	MemMaker does not preserve indentation in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
	files. MemMaker removes any spaces or tabs from the left margin of each line,
	including lines that it does not alter.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this situation, edit your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files after
	you run MemMaker to restore the spaces or tabs to your configuration files.
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
	release.
