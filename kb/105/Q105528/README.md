	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you minimize Mozart while the Glossary is open, the Glossary will be in front
	of the main Mozart window when you restore Mozart. This occurs even if the
	Glossary was behind the main Mozart window when you minimized the application.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mozart version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

	3. Press Mozart's minimize button.
	
	4. Double click the minimized Mozart icon to restore the application.
	
	Mozart is restored with the Glossary on top, even though the Glossary was in back
	when the application was minimized.
