## Q105297: Mozart: Sound Problems on Minimum Configuration System

	Article: Q105297
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Mozart or Stravinsky may display performance problems on a minimum configuration
	machine. For example, sound (waveform files) may be severely garbled and broken
	up when played on the following system:
	
	  Computer: 386/20
	  Windows: Version 3.1 in enhanced mode
	  RAM: 2 megabytes (MB)
	  Video: 16-color VGA
	
	You may also repeatedly receive the following error message when playing back
	sounds
	
	  Cannot read from drive X:
	
	where X is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.
	
	This problem is most likely to occur while playing sounds in the Mozart's World
	section of the Mozart application.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mozart and Stravinsky version
	1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To eliminate this problem, add one or two megabytes of RAM to your system.
	
	If adding memory is not possible, follow standard Windows optimization steps to
	help improve performance in Mozart and Stravinsky. For example, you can speed
	hard disk access by defragmenting your hard drive and setting up a permanent
	swap file.
	
	For more information about optimizing Windows, see chapter 14 (pages 515-555) in
	the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.1 and/or pages 258-272 in the
	"Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" for version 3.1.
