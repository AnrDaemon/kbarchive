	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To create a default custom view for a public folder, follow these steps:
	
	1. Log on to the Outlook client as the owner of a public folder, and select the
	  public folder.
	
	2. Customize the public folder to the desired view. This can be done using the
	  menu items for View.
	
	3. Save the custom view by clicking on View menu, then Define Views, and
	  selecting Current View Settings. Click Copy, and then type in your view name.
	  Then select "This folder, visible to everyone." Click OK, then Close.
	
	To select a custom view for a public folder, follow these steps:
	
	1. Log on to the Outlook client as the owner of a public folder.
	
	2. Right-click on the folder, and select Properties. Select the Administration
	  tab.
	
	  NOTE: If the Administration tab does not appear, you do not have owner
	  permissions.
	
	3. Select your custom view by clicking to enable the "Initial view on folder"
	  check box, and selecting the custom view that you just created from the drop
	  down list.
	
	NOTE: If users have already customized their view for that public folder, their
	view will stay until they specifically choose a different view. All users that
	have not customized the public folder view will receive the newly selected
	public folder view.
