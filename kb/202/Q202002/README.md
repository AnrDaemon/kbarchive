	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0, some newer IBM PS/2 systems may
	not have their PCBIOS data updated in the PCBIOS\Category table of the database.
	As a result, in addition to the PCBIOS information of newer systems not be
	discovered and entered into the database, the PC systems are not identified.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	IBM does use the System Descriptor Table generated by INT 0x15 to identify the
	different models. Getcomp.exe uses this same table to report the PCBIOS
	property.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
