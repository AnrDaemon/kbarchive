	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to a description of the error or comment, there are sometimes
	additional sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
	"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
	address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comment" section contains
	specific information for working around problems.
	
	Page 6: Boxes and Other Garbage Characters in Practice Document
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When you open a practice document, the file that appears has lots of box
	characters, Greek and symbol characters, and other nonsense.
	
	Correction:
	
	On page 6, step 4 after the graphic, add the following text:
	
	  " Note: Please refer to Using the Practice Files on page 267 of this book if
	  the file displays many square boxes and other garbage characters. " (without
	  the quotation marks)
	
	On page 267, under the heading "Using the Practice Files," add the following
	paragraph before the existing text:
	
	  " The practice files require Microsoft Works 3 or later to display properly.
	  To check your version of Works, start Works (as shown on page xvii) and
	  select About Microsoft Works from the Help menu. The resulting dialog box
	  will show the program name and version number. Works version 2 or earlier
	  needs to be upgraded to the latest version. Contact your local software store
	  for information on upgrading Microsoft Works. " (without the quotation marks)
	
	Comments:
	
	This problem is caused by opening the Works 3.0 practice file with a previous
	version of Microsoft Works.
	
	  NOTE: Similar file problems will occur if Works for MS-DOS is used instead of
	  Works for Windows.
	
	To verify which version of Microsoft Works you are using, do the following:
	
	1. Start Microsoft Works (as described on page xvii) if it is not already
	  running.
	
	2. From the Help menu, choose About Microsoft Works.
	
	  The Dialog box that appears will contain the program name AND version number.
	  Check to make sure it is version 3.0 or later. If the version is 2.x or
	  earlier, you will need to upgrade your version of Works in order to properly
	  use this book and the practice files.
	
	Contact a software retail store or call the Microsoft Sales Information Center
	for more information about upgrading.
	
	Step by Step Disk Doesn't Provide Icon or Executable Program
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The instructions for installing the practice disk are clear; however, after you
	install the disk, the system returns to Windows without any messages or
	directions on what to do next.
	
	Comments:
	
	The installation program copies the practice files to the hard drive. To access
	these files, you need to start Microsoft Works and use the appropriate commands
	to open a file. This book will provide the exact steps necessary to open these
	files in many of the lessons.
	
	The intent is for you to continue reading and to open the files when instructed
	by the book lessons. As the book implies, you will need Microsoft Works 3.0 in
	order to properly use the lessons and practice files.
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed in this article are ready for inclusion in
	future printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
