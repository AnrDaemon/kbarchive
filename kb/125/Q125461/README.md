## Q125461: Chat Options Return to Original Settings

	Article: Q125461
	Product(s): The Microsoft Network
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.2,1.3,2.0,2.5
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you have one chat room open, and then enter a second chat room and change
	options, your options may be saved as they were when you entered the first chat
	room, not as you changed them in the second chat room.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Changing options in a chat room does not change those options in other open chat
	rooms. MSN, The Microsoft Network, saves chat options as they are set in the
	last chat room that you close.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	When you want to change chat options, make sure you have only one chat room
	open.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
