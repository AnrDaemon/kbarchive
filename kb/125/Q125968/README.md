	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Start the Microsoft Productivity Pack for Windows.

	5. Choose the Go To button and then choose the Next Section button. Note that
	  Notepad opens in the background and displays the SPEECH.TXT file.
	
	6. Choose the Go To button and then choose Next Section. Note that Cardfile
	  opens in the background and displays the ADDRESS.CRD file, the Cleopatra-like
	  image is in the foreground, and that Notepad is minimized to an icon. If you
	  click the Notepad icon, you receive a message stating:
