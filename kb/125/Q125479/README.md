	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The MONITOR2.INF file lists details about monitors that are supported in Windows
	95. In some cases, the file lists a feature of a monitor that exceeds the
	manufacturer's specifications. For example, the MONITOR2.INF file lists a
	maximum resolution of 1280 x 1024 for the NEC 5FGe monitor. The NEC
	specification for this monitor lists a maximum resolution of 1024 x 768.
	
	Note that some hardware manufacturers list the maximum possible resolution for
	monitors only in non-interlaced mode. The MONITOR2.INF file lists the maximum
	possible resolution in interlaced or non-interlaced mode.
