	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the assistant of a user views the planner of the user, it does not show
	tentative appointments the user may have scheduled. However, if the assistant
	attempts to book a meeting for the same time as a tentative meeting, the
	assistant will receive a warning:
	
	  User already has an appointment booked at this time.
	  Do you want to book this overlapping appointment anyway?
	
	This message contradicts the free/busy times in the planner.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
	Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
