	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some NEC monitors are compliant with the Energy Star specifications. These
	monitors include the FGe and V series, with the exception of the 3FGe model. To
	determine if the monitor in question is Energy Star compliant, verify that the
	model number for the monitor ends in "-03". If the monitor model number does not
	end in "-03", the monitor is not compliant.
