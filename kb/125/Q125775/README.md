	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft TechNet, versions February 1995 edition, January 1995 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to print the Definitions from the "Glossary of Acronyms &
	Terms Online Resource-GATOR" found in the January 1995 or February 1995 TechNet
	CD, the defined Acronym will not print, nor will the Copy option print the
	defined Acronym. You can only print the list of Acronyms and Terms.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Run the TechNet CD. From the Help menu, choose Microsoft Glossary.
	
	2. Click any Acronym and notice there is no option available to print the
	  definition of the acronym.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To workaround this behavior, capture the screen image into the Clipboard and
	paste the graphic image into a word processing application. The word processing
	application must be capable of accepting a graphic image.
	
	To paste a captured screen into Microsoft Write and print:
	
	1. After the definition of the Acronym appears on the screen, press the
	  PRINTSCREEN key on the keyboard.
	
	2. Run Microsoft Write.
	
	3. From the Edit menu in Write, choose Paste. The graphic image will import into
	  the document.
	
	4. From the File menu, choose Print.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
