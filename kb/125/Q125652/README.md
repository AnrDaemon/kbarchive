	========
	
	When you add a NetWare domain to a site, the data associated with the Network
	Interface Card (NIC) ID attribute information for the NetWare server is
	incorrect. This data is not the NIC address, as it is for Windows NT servers.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2.
	
	NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
