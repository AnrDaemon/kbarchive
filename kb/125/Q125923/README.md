## Q125923: Playing Time Missing in Beethoven 2nd Movement

	Article: Q125923
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): 1.0,1.1
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 11-DEC-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Beethoven: The Ninth Symphony, versions 1.0, 1.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Multimedia Beethoven's "A Pocket Guide", the 2nd Movement section, has
	an inconsistency with the seconds timer count.
	
	The 1st Movement, 3rd Movement, and 4th Movement sections play all areas of music
	with no lapse in time between the selections. The 2nd Movement appears to skip
	49 seconds (00:49) between the Exposition and the Development selections.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To play this section of music, choose Contents from the A Pocket Guide screen,
	and select Movement 2 [10 minutes]. When you click on Play Through you will be
	able to play the missing time from :30 seconds to 1:17 seconds.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Run Microsoft Multimedia Beethoven.
	
	2. Select "A Pocket Guide."
	
	3. Click Exposition in the 2nd Movement. The seconds counter in the lower
	  portion of the screen at the beginning of Exposition shows:
	
	  Time: 00:00 into Movement 2
	
	  When Exposition completes, the seconds show:
	
	  Time: 00:29 into Movement 2
	
	4. Click Development in the 2nd Movement. The seconds counter in the lower
	  portion of the screen shows:
	
	  Time: 01:18 into Movement 2
	
	  When the Development completes, the seconds show:
	
	  Time: 02:23 into Movement 2
	
	The music in the 2nd Movement between :29 seconds and 1:18 (1 minute and 5
	seconds) is actually on the disc, but only the Primary Area of the Exposition
	will play from the A Pocket Guide section.
	
	The Primary Area, Transition, Secondary Area, and Closing Area of the Exposition
	are not listed as an option in the 2nd Movement.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Beethoven version 1.0 and 1.1. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
