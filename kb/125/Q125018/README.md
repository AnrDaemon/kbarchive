	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Double-clicking on a user or group on the To: or Cc: lines of a Read Note or
	form does not provide details of the user or group, only the friendly name and
	address.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
	for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you double-click on a user or group on the To: or Cc: lines of a Read Note
	or form, a Resolved Name Details dialog box appears with the friendly name and
	address of the user or group. This behavior is different from the Compose Note.
	
	When the resolved name of a user is double-clicked in a Compose Note, template
	information about that user is displayed. When the resolved name of a group is
	double-clicked in a Compose Note, a dialog box containing the group alias and
	group members appear. This behavior is similar to the Details button in the
	Address dialog box.
