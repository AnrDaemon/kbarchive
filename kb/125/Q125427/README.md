	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If your Creative Writer document contains pictures created with the Rebus tool,
	the pictures may not print on an ImageWriter printer. All the text prints,
	leaving gaps where the pictures should appear.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you are using Macintosh Operating System 7.5, you can install QuickDraw GX,
	and the QuickDraw GX ImageWriter driver, which prints the Rebus objects
	correctly on the ImageWriter.
