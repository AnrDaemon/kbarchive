	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are trying to install a program or Windows device driver, the Setup
	program for the program or device driver fails.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If the Setup program requires that an AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file be present
	on your hard disk, it may fail in Windows 95. If these files are not required
	due to your computer's configuration, they may not be present.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, you can either:
	
	- Create generic AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Obtain a new Setup program from the manufacturer.
