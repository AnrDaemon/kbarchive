	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.1 to Windows NT version 3.5,
	the SWITCH.INF file in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\RAS directory is
	overwritten. The old file is not backed up.
	
	This problem occurs when SWITCH.BAK already exists in the
	%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\RAS directory.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
