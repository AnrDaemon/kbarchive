	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When you change your Telnet terminal preferences and then choose the Cancel
	button, your configuration changes are saved (just as if you chose the OK
	button). This problem also occurs with the Fonts and Background Color
	options in the Terminal Preferences dialog box.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
