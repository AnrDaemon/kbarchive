	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you change the characteristics of a color in Paintbrush (for example, you
	change values for Red, Green, and Blue), and fill the whole screen with that
	color using the roller brush tool, subsequent attempts to repaint the whole
	screen take a long time.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
