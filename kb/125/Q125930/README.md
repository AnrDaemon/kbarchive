	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Paintbrush, if you open one of the bitmap files included with Windows NT by
	choosing Paste From from the Edit menu, the image does not appear. If you
	minimize or maximize the Paintbrush window, the image appears, but the vertical
	scroll bar disappears.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Start Paintbrush and choose Paste From from the Edit menu.
	
	2. Select one of the bitmap files in the %systemroot% (usually WINNT) directory,
	  and choose Info.
	
	3. From the Picture Information dialog box, choose OK.
	
	4. From the Paste From dialog box, choose OK.
	
	5. The drawing area of Paintbrush is empty.
	
	6. Either minimize or maximize Paintbrush.
	
	If you maximize the Paintbrush window, the image appears without the vertical
	scroll bar. If you minimize the Paintbrush window, choose the Paintbrush icon to
	see the image. The image appears, but without the vertical scroll bar.
