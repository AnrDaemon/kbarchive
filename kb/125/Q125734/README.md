	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If Microsoft Word for Windows is selected as the default word processor in
	Microsoft Encarta, and if Microsoft Bookshelf is installed with Word for Windows
	integration, you will be prompted to enter the Bookshelf CD when running Word
	for Windows from Encarta.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The behavior occurs if Bookshelf is integrated with Word for Windows and the
	Quote Of The Day option is selected in Word. To retrieve the quotation, Word for
	Windows looks for the Bookshelf CD.
	
	NOTE: This problem does not occur in Windows 95.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To run Word for Windows from Encarta without having to switch CDs, perform one
	of the following workarounds:
	
	Workaround 1
	------------
	
	The following message is displayed when you run Word for Windows from Encarta
	
	  Please Insert the Bookshelf <year> disk in the CD-ROM drive. If the
	  drive letter shown below is not the correct drive, please change it.
	
	where <year> is either 1993 or 1994. OK and Cancel are the only options.
	Click the Cancel button when prompted for the Bookshelf CD. After you click
	Cancel, the Quote Of The Day dialog box appears with the options:
	
	  [X] Display Quotation Daily Box
	  Another Quote
	  Paste Quote
	  Close
	  Help
	
	Selecting Close runs Word for Windows; however, the next calendar day produces
	the same symptom after you run Word for Windows from within Encarta.
	
	Workaround 2
	------------
	
	Clear the Display Quotation Daily option.
