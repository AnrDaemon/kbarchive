	=======
	
	The Filmography section of the Steve Martin entry of Cinemania 1995 incorrectly
	lists the 1950 version of the film "Father of the Bride."
	
	As the Biography section correctly notes, Steve Martin was in the 1991 film of
	the same name.
	
	This issue was corrected in the 1996 edition of Cinemania.
