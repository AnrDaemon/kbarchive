	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use a U.S. Robotics 14,400 Sportster modem with Microsoft At Work Fax
	to send a fax to a Group 3 fax machine, the modem may either successfully dial
	out but fail to make a connection or successfully negotiate the connection but
	fail to transmit the fax. A successful connection but failed fax transmission
	will cause the fax message to appear in the sender's Inbox marked as
	undeliverable mail.
