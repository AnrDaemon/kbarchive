	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	One of the necessary requirements for the X.25 transport for the
	Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 is the acquisition of the X.25 card.
	The card comes set up for either XT-style personal computers or PS/2
	computers with the micro channel architecture.
	
	
	Access Software
	---------------
	
	
	The access software is a terminal emulation package that allows for
	different methods of submitting files to the Eicon card. This software
	is generally used by PC technicians to pretest the operation of the
	Eicon card before the installation of the X.400 gateway software.
	
	
	Redirector Software
	-------------------
	
	
	The Redirector software allows for multiple message transfer agents
	(MTAs) to be placed on one local-area network (LAN). All MTAs then
	send to one Eicon card for transportation to the X.25 network.
	Transportation across the LAN is provided by NETBIOS.
