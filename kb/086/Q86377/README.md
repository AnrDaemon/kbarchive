	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows can send meeting requests to any user in the
	global address list. However, replies from some gateways may not be visible in
	the Schedule+ Messages window.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a function of the gateway.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This feature in gateways is under review and will be considered for inclusion in
	future releases of the gateways.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Gateways that are aware of Schedule+ can convert Schedule+ messages to their
	foreign system equivalent, and can convert the replies from a foreign scheduling
	program to Schedule+ messages. If a gateway is not Schedule+ aware or it does
	not recognize the foreign Schedule+ message type, then the message will be
	delivered in a standard note message to the Inbox of the Windows Mail client.
	
	For more information on Schedule+ aware gateways, check with your Microsoft
	Messaging Specialist.
