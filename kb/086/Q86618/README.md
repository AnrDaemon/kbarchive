	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Windows version 3.1 user-defined paper sizes for the NEC Pinwriter
	P5XL printer do not support 14-by-11-inch paper.
	
	To work around this problem, NEC recommends emulating the Epson LQ-2550, Epson
	LQ-2500, or the Epson LQ-1500 printer.
	
	Each of these Epson drivers offers a width range of [100-1400] and a length range
	of [100-2200], where the unit is 0.01 inch. However, only the Epson LQ-2550 and
	Epson LQ-2500 can print colors.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The user-defined paper sizes option for the NEC Pinwriter P5XL Windows version
	3.1 printer driver provides a width range of [100 850], and a length range of
	[100-9102], where the unit is 0.01 inch.
	
	This range does not offer the 14-inch width that was offered by the printer
	driver for Windows version 3.0, which offered a maximum paper size of 14-by-11
	inches.
