	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The documentation for the SetRecogHook() function on page 198 of the "Microsoft
	Windows Software Development Kit: Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing:
	Programmer's Reference" manual for version 3.1 refers to the WM_HOOKRESULT
	message. This reference is incorrect; the correct reference is to the
	WM_HOOKRCRESULT message.
	
	In addition, the WM_HOOKRCRESULT message has been omitted from the programmer's
	reference. For a full explanation of the message, query on the following word in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  " WM_HOOKRCRESULT " (without the quotation marks)
