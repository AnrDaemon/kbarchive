	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If it becomes necessary to shut down the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail,
	you must delete all files from the MFFPUT, MFFGET, and 3C-OUT directories before
	restarting. These are the temporary files that are being transmitted between
	Microsoft Mail and 3+Mail. Deleting these files ensures that the gateway will
	start cleanly.
