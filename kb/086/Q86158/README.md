	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Communications Server (Comm Server) program with the DCA-DFT
	emulation API is supported for use with the IBM PROFS Gateway.
	
	From the VM side of the gateway, there is no difference in operation if Comm
	Server is used instead of a stand-alone 3270 emulation package. The Host Access
	programs and files are still accessed in the same way, and the gateway operates
	in the same way.
