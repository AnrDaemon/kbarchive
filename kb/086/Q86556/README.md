	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS is defined within MHS. The MHS connectivity
	"spawns" the gateway executables from within its directory structure. Therefore,
	the only hardware required by the gateway is the hardware required by the actual
	host because it is really just a process running as part of the connectivity
	manager.
