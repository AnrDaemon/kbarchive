	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The author of a file for the Microsoft Windows Help application can use the
	Print macro to print the contents of the current topic.
	
	In Windows Help version 3.1, it is not possible to include the contents of an
	active pop-up window in the printed output. Executing the Print macro in a
	pop-up window prints only the contents of the topic that created the pop up.
