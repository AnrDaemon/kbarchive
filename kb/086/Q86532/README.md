	  21 Complex Data
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Changing the Graphics setting to 150 x 150 may correct this problem. However,
	the document will print in a lower resolution. To change this setting, do the
	following:
	
	1. Run Control Panel.
	
	2. Choose the Printers icon.
	
	3. Select the Canon LPB-8 II printer, and choose the Setup button.
	
	4. Under Graphics, select 150 x 150.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Canon LBP-8 II printer
	driver version 3.09. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Printing in landscape mode on the Canon LBP-8 II may result in the above message
	when the text being printed is more than half a page in length. A document in
	landscape mode that contains less than half a page of text should print
	normally.
	
	Printing in portrait mode does not seem to be a problem. Disabling Print Manager,
	the Fast Printing Direct To Port option, or TrueType fonts seems to have no
	effect on this problem.
