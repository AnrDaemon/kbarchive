	To check for mail going from Microsoft Mail to 3Com 3+Mail, use the Admin
	program by selecting Queue, then entering SMTP as the network. The headers for
	all messages queued for 3+Mail will be displayed.
	
	For mail items coming from 3+Mail to Microsoft Mail, you can check to see if
	there are any items queued by using the 3M DIRM command on the 3Com network.
	This lists the number of messages each user has waiting.
	
	For more information about the 3Com commands for 3+Mail, see the 3Com manuals.
