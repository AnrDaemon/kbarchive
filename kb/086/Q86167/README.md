	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Always On Top feature of a Windows-based application while
	working with the Windows 3.1 Paintbrush, it's possible for the application's
	image to be captured by Paintbrush.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some Windows-based applications have an option to remain on top of all other
	windows on the desktop. This option is commonly referred to as Always On Top.
	Windows 3.1 Paintbrush can capture the image of a part or all of the application
	that has the Always On Top option enabled. This can be done if the application
	overlaps the Paintbrush workspace.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 3.1 Paintbrush. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
