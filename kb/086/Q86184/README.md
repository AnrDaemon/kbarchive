	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows with the
	French or German edition of Microsoft Windows version 3.1, attaching the
	MSMAIL.EXE file to a message causes the system to become unstable, and you have
	to restart the Windows 3.1 operating environment. This problem occurs only with
	foreign editions of Windows version 3.1.
	
	STATUS

	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail for Windows
	versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
