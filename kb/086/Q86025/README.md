	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you print Microsoft Windows version 3.1 TrueType fonts at large point sizes
	greater than 90 point to early model Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet series II
	printers or compatibles, you may need to select the Print TrueType Fonts As
	Graphics option from the Control Panel Printers option.
	
	This problem is caused by a BIOS limitation in early model LaserJet II printers
	and some compatibles. Fonts smaller than 80 or 90 point do not require the Print
	TrueType Fonts As Graphics option.
