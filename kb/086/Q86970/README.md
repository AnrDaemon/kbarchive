	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Using the access software, test the X.25 line or null modem connection before
	installing the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 software.
	
	The Eicon Technologies terminal emulation package can interface to the Eicon
	Technologies X.25 board, and a test of the X.25 line can be conducted. The
	access software can be purchased separately, from Eicon Technologies.
	
	The software allows the technician to make a terminal connection across the X.25
	or a null modem line. Generally, this is all that is required to test the line.
	
	For more information, contact Eicon Technologies.
