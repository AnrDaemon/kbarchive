	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Bookshelf 1991 contains a documentation error concerning Setup. Page 4 of the
	"Microsoft Bookshelf User's Guide" outlines the seven steps necessary to install
	the product. The directions in step 5 are incorrect. Step 5 is printed as
	follows:
	
	1. Type the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive, a colon (:), and setup (for
	  example d:setup).
	
	Typing "d:setup" (without the quotation marks) results in a Application Execution
	Error. The proper syntax for Setup is "d:\setup" without the quotation marks,
	where d is the CD-ROM drive.
