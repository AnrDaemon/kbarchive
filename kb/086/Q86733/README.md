	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) has confirmed that communications with a
	modem may not be stable with Windows 3.1 when using the DEC Pathworks network
	version 4.1.
	
	DEC recommends you run at 2400 bits per second (BPS) to eliminate this problem,
	until new drivers are available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you use any communications package at 9600 BPS and are attached to the
	network, the application may drop characters and put unreadable characters
	("garbage") on the screen. This is a known problem with the DEC Pathworks
	drivers, and DEC is currently investigating the problem.
	
	The DEC products included here are manufactured by DEC, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
	performance or reliability.
