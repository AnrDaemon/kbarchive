	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, on platform(s):
	   - the operating system: MS-DOS 
	   - the operating system: Mac OS 9.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	All Microsoft Mail for PC Networks clients are compatible with version 2.x
	postoffices; however, the clients are not compatible with version 1.x
	postoffices. If the Macintosh or MS-DOS client is run against a version 2.x
	postoffice, the client will issue a warning message on startup and then proceeds
	to the login display.
	
	For the Macintosh client, the message is:
	
	  The version of your postoffice is older than the Macintosh client you are
	  running. Please notify your administrator.
	
	For the MS-DOS client, the message is:
	
	  Postoffice version is older than this program version. Notify administrator.
	
	NOTE: If the version 3.0 Mail program is run against a version 2.x postoffice
	without the version 3.0 MS-DOS client Install program being run on that
	postoffice, the following error message is displayed:
	
	  Cannot access server error file: ENGMAI.GLB
	
	This message means that the MS-DOS version 3.0 error file is not installed on
	that postoffice.
	
	
	Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a postoffice
