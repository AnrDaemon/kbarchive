	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	X.400 address lists can be entered into the gateway postoffice or the downstream
	postoffices in one of three ways:
	
	- manually with the Admin program
	
	- semi-automatically with the Import program
	
	- automatically with of DirSync (but not in every case)
	
	Entering address lists manually through the Admin program can be very time
	consuming.
	
	Address lists that are not already Microsoft Mail postoffices cannot be entered
	by DirSync.
	
	The Import program is used to enter foreign mail addresses into the Microsoft
	Mail system. The Import program comes with the Microsoft Mail Server disks for
	the postoffice.
