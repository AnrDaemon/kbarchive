	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When printing from Microsoft Windows 3.1 to a Hewlett-Packard PaintJet XL
	printer version 1.0, the Print Quality option allows you to choose Normal Mode
	or Presentation Mode. This has no effect unless you are printing graphics. This
	is by design.
	
	The standard HP PaintJet does not have the Print Quality option.
	
	For example, if you run Write (WRITE.EXE), type a line of text, and print the
	text, then selecting Normal or Presentation mode results in the same quality
	output.
