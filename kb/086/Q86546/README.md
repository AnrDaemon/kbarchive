	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MHS is an acronym for Message Handling Service. The term MHS is widely used by
	many mail systems to describe their message handling service implementation, but
	normally there is little or no consistency among these implementations. In this
	article, MHS refers to Action Technologies' and Novell's implementation of a
	store-and-forward electronic mail system.
	
	MHS is a software program designed for the reliable routing and transfer of
	electronic messages from one location to another. MHS, using its file transfer
	protocol, modem control, routing tables, transport protocol, and error checking,
	handles all the issues associated with getting information from the sending
	workstation to the destination workstation, error free, regardless of the LAN
	and WAN topologies between the sender and recipient.
