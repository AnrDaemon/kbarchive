	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows does not allow more than one notes page to be
	associated with a particular slide. In some cases, it may be difficult to fit
	all necessary text on a single notes page.

	================
	
	PowerPoint 7.0
	--------------
	
	You can use the PowerPoint Write-Up feature to create unlimited notes pages with
	Word for a particular slide. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Write-Up.
	
	2. Choose the desired format of the page.
	
	3. Start Word and add any additional notes for the slide.
	
	PowerPoint 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0
	-----------------------------
	
	You can create an extra dummy slide and use its notes page for additional text.
	
	1. In Slide Sorter view, select the slide that requires an additional notes
	  page.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.
	
	3. On the Edit menu, click Paste to create an identical slide.
	
	4. In Notes view, move to the second of the two identical slides.
	
	5. Select the slide image. On the Edit menu, click Cut.
	
	This process can be repeated to create additional pages for the slides in Notes
	view.
	
	NOTE: The presenter must advance through these identical slides during the
	presentation; however, this should not be noticed by the audience provided no
	transition effects are used between the identical slides. (PowerPoint 2.0 does
	not provide transition effects.)
