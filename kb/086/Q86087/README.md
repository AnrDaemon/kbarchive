	Overview
	--------
	
	This print utility for Mastering Microsoft Visual FoxPro provides an alternative
	method for printing out the documents on the CD.
	
	To use this print utility, you must have already installed Mastering Visual
	FoxPro and have the Mastering Visual FoxPro CD in your CD-ROM drive.
	
	Note that this utility uses the data files on the CD while printing, so do not
	remove the Mastering Visual FoxPro CD from your CD-ROM drive while using this
	utility.
	
	Installing and Running the Print Utility
	----------------------------------------
	
	To install and run the Mastering Visual FoxPro print utility, perform the
	following:
	
	1. Run the self-extracting file Mvfpprnt.exe to extract the print utility,
	  Mvfp_pri.exe, and its accompanying file, Readme.txt.
	
	2. Copy Mvfp_pri.exe into the directory where you have installed Mastering
	  Visual FoxPro (The default directory is C:\MVFP).
	
	3. Start the print utility by running Mvfp_pri.exe.
	
	On startup, if the print utility cannot find the data files it needs to run you
	will see an error message prompting you to correct the problem. To find the
	source of the problem, see the section CD-ROM Problems in the Readme.txt file
	included with Mastering Visual FoxPro.
	
	Using the Print Utility
	-----------------------
	
	The print utility uses an interface similar to the Navigator for selecting the
	document you want to print.
	
	First, from the drop down list of the combo box, select the information resource
	of the document you want to print. When you select a new information resource
	from the combo box, the list box underneath will show all of the documents
	available for that resource. Note that not all of the resources in Mastering
	Visual FoxPro are shown in the combo box -- only those resources that are
	printable are shown.
	
	Second, scroll through the list box to find the document you want to print. This
	list is the exact same list as in the Navigator in Master Visual FoxPro, except
	for the Course resource.
	
	The list for the Course resource is different in that you cannot expand or
	collapse the outline and it only shows the first two levels of the outline.
	However, the list is in the same order as the Course outline so it should be
	easy to find the document you want to print.
	
	Finally, to print out the desired document simply highlight the document and
	click the Print button. Alternatively, you can double-click the document listed
	to print it. If the Print button is disabled, it means you have highlighted a
	section heading, which is not printable, instead of a document.
