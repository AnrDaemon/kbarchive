	If you run Central Point Anti-Virus (CPAV.EXE) in a windowed MS-DOS
	session or in the background, a sharing violation will occur. However,
	CPAV.EXE handles the sharing violation internally. You will notice
	that CPAV.EXE becomes the active application.
	
	If CPAV.EXE is running full screen, it will not become the active
	application, and runs as normal.
