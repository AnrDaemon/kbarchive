	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	An MHS Host is a microcomputer running the Message Handling Service (MHS)
	software. The host itself can be a standalone computer or, more commonly, a LAN
	workstation.
	
	There are three main components of MHS:
	
	- The Directory Manager
	
	- The Connectivity Manager
	
	- The Transport Server

	The following are descriptions of each of the main components listed above:
	
	  Component              Description
	  ---------              -----------
	
	  Directory Manager      Administrators use the Directory Manager to
	                         define the MHS database and manage software
	                         applications that use MHS. The database itself
	                         is a directory structure containing routes to
	                         users, hosts, and workgroups. This routing
	                         information is called the routing table.
	
	  Connectivity Manager   This part of MHS routes messages within the
	                         database.
	
	  Transport Server       The Transport Server transfers the routed
	                         messages between MHS hosts.
