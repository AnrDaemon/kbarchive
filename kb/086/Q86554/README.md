	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Message Handling Service (MHS) hosts can be either workstations that are
	standalone or workstations that are connected to a network.
	
	The Standalone Host always requires a modem for communication with other MHS
	hosts. The "MHS" software this host will be running will always have a "P" after
	the version number (for example, 1.5P). The P denotes personal version.
	
	The LAN Host requires access to a local-area-network (LAN) server (for example,
	Novell NetWare or Microsoft LAN Manager). If the host needs to communicate to
	other LAN hosts, the machine will require access to those servers as well. If
	the host needs to communicate to other hosts not directly available through a
	direct LAN connection (for example, over phone lines, and so forth), it requires
	a modem and an outside phone line.
