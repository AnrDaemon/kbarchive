	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Windows-based applications always display their default icon and title when
	minimized. Any change made to an application's default icon, or default
	description in Program Manager will have no effect when the program is running
	and is minimized on the desktop.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	All Windows-based applications have one or more icons embedded in their
	executable (.EXE). The first embedded icon is the application's default icon
	that will appear in Program Manager if a specific icon is not assigned. Changing
	the assigned icon to any other icon, including other embedded icons, will not
	change the way the application appears when minimized.
