	The X.121 is an address that enables packets to be sent to people on a public
	data network. The X.25 network uses X.121 addresses to determine routing within
	the X.25 network.
	
	The X.121 address can be equated to a voice phone number on a telephone network.
	
	The X.121 address length for an international data number is a 10-digit numeric
	character set from 0 to 9. The number formats for various data accesses are as
