	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A gateway, when used in conjunction with electronic mail systems, is designed to
	connect two or more dissimilar mail systems. For example, in order to link two
	dissimilar mail system called A and B, the gateway sends and receives messages
	from mail system A using the protocols associated with that mail system and it
	sends and receives messages from mail system B using the protocols associated
	with mail system B.
	
	The gateway changes all the protocols necessary between the two mail systems, but
	it does not change the actual data being sent; that is, what you send is what is
	received by the destination mail system.
	
	Gateways are not always able to provide every service requested by a mail system
	since they are limited by the services available at the other mail system. For
	example, one mail system may support registered mail. When it sends a registered
	mail message through the gateway to another mail system, that receiving mail
	system must be able to support registered mail. If the mail system does not
	support registered mail, this service has no use when communicating with this
	mail system.
