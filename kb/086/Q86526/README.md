	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you use Hewlett-Packard (HP) Scanning Gallery version 5.0 with Microsoft
	Windows version 3.1, you may encounter the following problems:
	
	- General protection (GP) faults
	
	- When you are running in 386 enhanced mode, Windows may unexpectedly exit to
	  the MS-DOS command prompt
	
	Microsoft recommends that you use HP DeskScan II version 1.51 software when you
	are using HP ScanJet and ScanJet Plus scanners with Windows 3.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The HP DeskScan II version 1.51 upgrade provides the following functionality:
	
	- TWAIN compliance (the industry standard protocol for scanning and acquiring
	  graphics from software applications)
	
	- AutoFind (this automatically finds the image on the scanned page)
	
	- AutoImage (this detects whether the image is color or black and white, and
	  whether it is a drawing or photograph)
	
	- Windows 3.1 compatibility for both 386 enhanced and standard modes
	
	Scan Gallery version 5.0 works with both the ScanJet and the ScanJet Plus
