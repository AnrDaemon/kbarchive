	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision provides seamless
	integration between Microsoft Mail and PROFS, OfficeVision, CMS Notes, MVS/TSO,
	Softswitch, DISOSS, AS/400, and many other messaging systems that communicate
	with VM-based systems.
	
	The basic Host Access component is needed to communicate with PROFS,
	OfficeVision/VM, and CMS Notes. Distribution Manager (DM) is required to
	exchange messages and files with OfficeVision/MVS, MVS/TSO, AS/400, and DISOSS.
	DM is purchased separately from the Host Access component. For more information,
	see pages 1-5 of the "Microsoft Mail Host Access for IBM PROFS and OfficeVision
	VM Administrator's Guide."
