	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If the CAPTURE application provided with Microsoft FoxBASE+ is used to reroute
	printing from one nondedicated server to another nondedicated server, any
	subsequent printing requests hang a Novell ELS I, ELS II, or Advanced Network
	server.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The server acts as if it has control of the remote printer as a local device.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Obtain the PRFIX file from Novell Technical Support.
	
	The Novell products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
