	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If a problem or an error occurs with the Microsoft Mail Host Access component
	programs, the gateway can generate an incident report file which contains
	incoming and outgoing mailbags (including the text of the messages), and dumps
	of the gateway configuration files.
	
	Using the INCIDENT_OPTIONS field in the PWAINIT EXEC file, the VM administrator
	can specify which messages/attachments they want to have included in the
	INCIDENT REPORT file (that is, messages/attachments from the LAN or
	messages/files from the VM). The details on how to do this are listed in the
	"Microsoft Mail Host Access for IBM PROFS and OfficeVision VM Administrator's
	Guide."
