	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The standard communications protocol for the deaf or hard of hearing is called
	text telephone (TT). This protocol is based on the old baudot code (5 bit) used
	in the early teletype machines. Standard modems and software cannot communicate
	with this protocol. The new Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 will require
	that almost all businesses be able to accept calls from the deaf or hard of
	hearing.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The product Fulltalk works in the Windows operating system and allows you to
	access the TT protocol. The product comes with a proprietary modem that auto
	detects between TT and standard ASCII communications. The modem can coexist with
	a standard modem or fax modem. The system can handle both international TT (50
	bits per second [BPS]) and US TT (45.5 BPS). It also receives Bell 103 ASCII
	(110/300 BPS) and CITT Europe ASCII (300 BPS). The modem is a half card.
	
	The software has built-in bulletin board and electronic mail capabilities. It
	will run in the background and "flash" the active windows borders to announce
	incoming transactions.
	
	The Fulltalk product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
