	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Field and type addressing templates are selected from the X.400 listing
	maintenance in the Admin program. The template used has two distinct
	differences:
	
	- The ability to enter address information
	
	- The presentation of the address to the user, should the user query the nature
	  of the X.400 address.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The field addressing method uses a set of X.400 fields, each of which contains a
	template that helps the administrator enter the X.400 address information. The
	field entry also passes the information to the client interface, so users can
	see the template describing the complex X.400 address. The disadvantage to the
	field format is a restriction in the number of address variables available to
	the X.400 addressing. The template allows only for the most widely-used address
	variables.
	
	A one-line template is used to enter the X.400 address information when the type
	address is selected. The disadvantage to the one-line template is its lack of
	user friendliness when a user requests additional information for a particular
	person's full name identification from the user list. The advantage to the
	one-line format is that it can enter all parameters available for the X.400
	addresses.
