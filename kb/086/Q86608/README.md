	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	One of the general options available in Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows is
	for when the day starts. You can set this option to any time, but for
	practical purposes, Schedule+ rounds this time to the nearest half hour.
	
	When you first open the Appointment Book, the time setting scrolls the
	Appointment Book to the beginning of the day. The time setting is also used
	by Auto-Pick to define a range of acceptable times in your day when you set
	meetings. The Planner, Appointment Book, and the Auto-Pick command use half-
	hour increments for display, so this setting is rounded to the nearest half
	hour. This setting is not reflected when other people view your schedule in
	the Planner or open your Appointment Book.
