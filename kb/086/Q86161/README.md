	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	- Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Windows version 3.1 and Windows versions 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions do
	not support playing files with the .VOC extension. The .VOC file format is
	a "wave form audio" format, similar to the format of .WAV files.
	
	Microsoft does not distribute a conversion utility to change .VOC files to
	.WAV files. Third-party or shareware applications may be available to
	perform such a conversion.
	
	NOTE: The Windows Sound System contains a sound playing and conversion
	utility called "Sound Finder," which allows the playing of .VOC files.

	Base:
