	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 occupies the top four levels of the OSI
	software stack: application, presentation, session, and transport. This leaves
	the lower three levels available for transporting from point to point.
	
	The lower three levels can range from X.25, TP4, TP0, TCP/IP, IPX, and so forth;
	however, only the X.25 packet protocol is currently supported.
