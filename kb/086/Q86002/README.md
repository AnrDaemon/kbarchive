	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows is running with Microsoft Windows
	version 3.0, the Tile command places the windows in vertical alignment. The Tile
	command can be run by choosing Tile from the Window menu in Mail.
	
	When Mail is running with Windows version 3.1, the Tile command places the
	windows in horizontal alignment.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In Windows version 3.0, there is no API (application programming interface)
	support for tiling horizontally. This is a new feature introduced in Windows
	version 3.1.
