	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To test the X.25 connection before installing the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
	X.400, perform these steps:
	
	1. NA TEST: To test the Eicon Card hardware parameters, jumper settings, and
	  perform a complete set of hardware diagnostics on the Eicon card, use the NA
	  TEST feature that comes with the Eicon card.
	
	2. Access software: The access software uses a protocol called ITI (Interactive
	  Terminal Interface), which allows for the transfer of binary files between
	  terminals across an X.25 network, for a test of file transfers and general
	  X.25 network operation. Set up and perform this test before you install the
	  X.400 gateway.
