	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows displays the following error message while
	importing appointments if there is a conflicting appointment:
	
	  This appointment will conflict with an existing appointment in your schedule.
	  Do you want to add it anyway?
	
	If the imported appointment has more text than can be displayed on one line, the
	window size of the alert will be too large for the screen. If this happens, the
	Yes and No buttons in the dialog box may be off the screen.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, move the window to the left until the buttons are
	visible, or use the ALT+Y (Yes) or ALT+N (No) key combination to close the
	dialog box.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
	Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
