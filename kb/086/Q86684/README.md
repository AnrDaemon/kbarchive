	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The MIDI Mapper allows you to control the way a MIDI device plays MIDI files.
	Patch maps allow you to substitute one instrument on the MIDI device for
	another. The Source Patch indicates the number of the instrument specified in
	the MIDI file and the Destination Patch indicates the instrument number that
	will actually be sent to the hardware device.
	
	For further information about using the MIDI Mapper to configure a MIDI device,
