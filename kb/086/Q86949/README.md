	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To trace problems with the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, you need this
	information:
	
	- The version of the gateway (should be 3.0, build #10)
	
	- The version of 3+Share or 3+Open
	
	- What network drivers are being loaded
	
	- Any error messages encountered
	
	In most cases, to get the gateway working again, you can simply delete all the
	temporary files in the MFFPUT, MFFGET, and 3C-OUT directories. Once this is
	done, you can restart the gateway.
