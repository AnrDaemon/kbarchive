	On the Compose screen, the accelerator keys for TO, CC, SUBJECT, PRIORITY, and
	ATTACHMENTS are now highlighted.
	
	Micro--No Password Execution

	If you do not start the Micro utility with a password, the program installs;
	however, it will not display any information about an arriving message but it
	simply notifies you that a message has arrived.
