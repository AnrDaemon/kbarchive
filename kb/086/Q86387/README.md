	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The folder conversion program (CONVERT.EXE) for version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
	for Windows displays the percent complete indicator based on the total number of
	messages in the folder and how many have been converted.
	
	For example, if there are 100 messages in the folder and 50 have been converted,
	the indicator will read 50 percent. If there is only one message in the folder,
	the indicator will jump from 0 percent to 100 percent very quickly.
