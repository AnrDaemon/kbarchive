	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Windows does not support bidirectional printing on dot-matrix
	printers.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you print graphics or TrueType fonts to a dot-matrix printer that uses
	bidirectional printing, you receive jagged lines and/or characters as output.
	TrueType fonts and graphics require a high degree of precision; current printer
	implementations of bidirectional printing are not capable of this precision.
	
	If you are using an unsupported dot-matrix printer emulating a supported printer,
	you may need to disable the printer's hardware implementation of bidirectional
	printing in order to produce quality output.
