	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The message transfer agent (MTA) name designation depends upon the type of
	network you are installing to.
	
	If the X.25 and X.400 networks are private, the network administrator can decide
	whether to assign and check that there are no other MTA names that are the
	same.
	
	With a public network, the public service provider must administer the MTA names.
	This is to ensure there are no conflicts with other X.400 MTAs and provide a
	unique identifier for your messages.
