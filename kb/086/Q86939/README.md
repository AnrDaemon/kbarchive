	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A complete description of how to add 3+Mail addresses to the Microsoft Mail
	postoffice address list (POL) is in the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail
	Administrator's Guide."
	
	To allow Microsoft Mail users to address to 3+Mail addresses, you add the
	addresses to the SMTP address list. Once 3+Mail addresses have been entered and
	assigned an alias, you can then add the aliases to the postoffice address list.
	Users can then select 3+Mail users just as they select other Microsoft Mail
	users.
