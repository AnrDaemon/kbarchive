	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After you install a new version of Microsoft Windows, pressing the ALT+Q
	keystroke combination in printing dialog boxes, such as Write's Print dialog
	box, skips to the Copies check box instead of selecting the Print Quality box.
	If you attempt to choose the Print Quality box by using the TAB key, the same
	thing happens.
	
	Other applications that use COMMDLG.DLL, such as Excel version 4.0 may also have
	this problem.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you install other programs that use a different version of the COMMDLG.DLL
	and/or KEYBOARD.DRV, you might not be able to reproduce this problem.
