	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select MSN Explorer as Default E-mail Client and attempt to send an
	e-mail from the Internet Explorer Mail link, you receive the following error:
	
	  "Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot
	  fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the
	  default mail client".
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	MSN Explorer is not a simple Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
	client and cannot be used as the default e-mail client in all cases.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Send e-mail directly from MSN Explorer. To prevent the alert from occurring
	again, set the default e-mail client to another program such as Microsoft
	Outlook Express.
