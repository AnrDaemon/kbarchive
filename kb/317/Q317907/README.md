	In the United States and Canada, if you have questions about a cash-back rebate
	offer, do one of the following:
	
	- See the Online Microsoft Consumer Rebate Center at the following Microsoft
	  Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/insider/rebates/
	
	- Call the appropriate Microsoft Rebate Center for the product in question
	  (8:00 a.m. until 7:30p.m. EST, except weekends and holidays). No rebates will
	  be authorized over the phone.
	
	Please allow six to eight weeks for delivery of your rebate.
	
	Offer valid only in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, all U.S.
	military bases that contain valid APO/FPO addresses, and Canada. Offer not valid
	in U.S. Territories, including Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, or Guam. Offer
	void where prohibited, taxed, or restricted by law. Only original coupons will
	be accepted.
	
	Contact the Rebate Center for any of the following issues or concerns:
	
	- Your rebate coupon is missing. Note that rebate information is included
	  either inside the product box or on a sticker on the outside of the box.
	
	- The rebate information is incomplete or incorrect. For example, the rebate
	  address is missing from the coupon. Please note that some coupons have two
	  portions, and the information that you need may be on the second portion.
	
	- You never received the rebate. Note that only one rebate is allowed per
	  household per product (unless otherwise stated). If you purchase multiple
	  copies of the same product, you will receive only one rebate for that
	  purchase.
	
	- You want to check on the status of your rebate. Please remember to allow six
	  to eight weeks for delivery of your rebate check.
	
	Microsoft will not share the information that you provide with third parties
