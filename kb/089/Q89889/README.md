	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are in minimal view, Quick Recorder creates a new file with the
	following attributes:
	
	  Sample rate:        11 kHz
	  Number of channels: 1 (for mono), 2 (for stereo)
	  Compression:        Determined by the compression settings in the
	                      expanded view or by setting the compression in the
	                      Compression dialog box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You cannot change the sampling rate or the number of channels while in minimal
	view. You must set all changes before changing to minimal view.
	
	Compression sets the manner in which the file is saved. You can change the
	compression in either expanded or minimal view if you use the compression dialog
	option to set it.
