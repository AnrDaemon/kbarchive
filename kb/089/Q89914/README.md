	Paintbrush, the image is displayed as a black box. If you want to use picture
	icons created in Quick Recorder, use 16-color images.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Sound System Quick
	Recorder versions 1.0 and 1.0a. This problem was corrected in Windows Sound
