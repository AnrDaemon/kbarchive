	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Full left and right justification does not display properly in Microsoft Windows
	with some TrueType fonts in the 11-point size. This occurs in VGA (640 x 480)
	and Super VGA (800 x 600) modes. The problem is caused by the right
	justification; the right side does not line up properly when it is being
	displayed.
	
	NOTE: Documents print correctly; this problem only affects the screen display.
