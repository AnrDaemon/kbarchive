	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To disable the Startup group from functioning in Windows for Workgroups, press
	the SHIFT key immediately after the login prompt.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the Startup group is used to
	load applications automatically when starting Windows. You can disable these
	programs by holding down the SHIFT key as Windows loads. Because Windows for
	Workgroups prompts you for a case-sensitive password when loading, you must
	enter your password before holding down the SHIFT key to disable the Startup
	group.
	
	If warnings or error messages appear after you type your password, respond
	appropriately while holding down the SHIFT key.
	
	NOTE: Since Windows for Workgroups checks to see if the SHIFT key has been
	pressed immediately after the logon prompt, you may need to press the SHIFT key
	while you press OK or ENTER in response to that prompt. Then continue to hold
	down the SHIFT key to prevent starting applications.
