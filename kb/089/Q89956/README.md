	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you choose Cancel while Sound Finder is converting a file and you have chosen
	to overwrite the existing file with the new format, the conversion will still
	overwrite the existing file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Once you have chosen to overwrite a file (that is, you respond Yes when asked
	whether to replace a file with the same name) and the conversion process has
	begun, the old file is deleted. At this point, the old file is not recoverable.
	To avoid losing a usable copy of the file, allow the conversion process to
	complete.
