	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Windows Sound System Quick Recorder allows you to open and modify read-only
	files, but it does not allow you to save them with the same filename. If you try
	to save the file with the same filename, the following error displays:
	
	  This file is read only. Use a different filename.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To save your modifications, use a different filename or modify the file
	attributes (that is, disable the read-only attribute).
