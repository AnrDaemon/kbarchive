	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you increase your Icon Spacing value to a number that is too high, your icons
	always arrange vertically in Program Manager.
	
	NOTE: To cause this effect, you have to have set your icon spacing very high,
	usually above 140; however, the value depends on your video resolution and group
	window size.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct the problem, reduce the Icon Spacing value.
	
	1. Run Control Panel.
	
	2. Choose the Desktop icon.
	
	3. Change the Icon Spacing setting to 75.
	
	4. Choose the OK button to save your changes.
	
	When you activate a group within Program Manager and select Arrange Icons from
	the Window menu, the icons arrange horizontally.
