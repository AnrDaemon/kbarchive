	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Do the following to set the aiming marker:
	
	1. Launch Golf.
	
	2. From the Welcome to Microsoft Golf dialog box, choose the Start New Game
	  button.
	
	3. From the new game, choose Continue.
	
	4. In the Player Settings for this Game dialog box, choose OK.
	
	5. Make the main view window smaller by clicking the button in the upper right
	  corner of the window that has an up and down arrow on it.
	
	6. Place the aiming marker for your shot.
	
	7. Maximize the main view by clicking the button in the upper right corner of
	  the window that has an up arrow on it.
	
	8. Click the right mouse button inside the main view to note aiming marker
	  location.
	
	9. The aiming marker will be located in the upper left corner of the window.
	
	Note: If the ball is hit when the main view is maximized, the ball goes
	straight.
	
	If you press the right mouse button in the main view to view the location of the
	aiming marker and then take a shot, the ball goes toward the upper left corner.
	This will be addressed in a future version of Golf.
