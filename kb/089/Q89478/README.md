	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you upgrade from Microsoft Windows versions 3.1 or 3.11 to Windows for
	Workgroups version 3.1, some printer device settings may not be retained.
	
	As a general rule, Microsoft recommends that customers reset their printer device
	mode settings with the Control Panel. To do this, choose the Printers icon and
	then choose the Setup button.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	After the upgrade, settings for dot matrix printer drivers are reset to the
	defaults.
	
	For PostScript and Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printers, most settings are
	retained with the exception of the previous printer memory settings, which
	return to the default value. To reset these values:
	
	1. Run Control Panel.
	
	2. Choose the Printers icon.
	
	3. Choose the Configure button.
	
	4. Choose the Setup button.
