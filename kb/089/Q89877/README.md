	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Yamaha OPL3 synthesis chip (YMF262) is backward-compatible with the Yamaha
	OPL2 synthesis chip (YM3812), the synthesis chip used in Adlib and
	Adlib-compatible boards. The OPL3 chip supports more complex waveforms, more
	voices, and stereo sound. It is also compatible with other sound cards.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Because the OPL3 has two modes, one of them being a compatibility mode at
	startup, the compatibility is only ensured after you have turned off and
	restarted your computer.
	
	The OPL3's new features are:
	
	- More complex waveforms creating more complex timbres
	
	- More voices (up from 9 to 18)
	
	- Stereo voices (although a voice must be entirely on the left channel, right
	  channel, or both)
	
	Some MediaVision cards, Adlib-gold cards, and newer versions of the SoundBlaster
	Pro card use the OPL3. The OPL3 chip can be identified by looking for a surface
	mount chip with the label "YMF262" on the sound card.
