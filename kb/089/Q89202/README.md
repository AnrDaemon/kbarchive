	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The spelling checker in Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Creative Writer
	versions 1.0 and 1.1 do not handle some abbreviated words correctly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For example, the spelling checker marks the abbreviation "etc." as a misspelled
	word. In the Spelling dialog box, it appears as "etc" (no period). If you choose
	Suggest, the spelling checker will offer "etc." (with a period) as the
	correction. If you accept this as the correction, you will end up with "etc.."
	(two periods) as the corrected word.
	
	If you check the spelling in the presentation again, "etc" will again be found as
	having no period; if you again accept the offered correction, you will end up
	with three periods. This continues to occur for as many times as you spell check
	the presentation.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
