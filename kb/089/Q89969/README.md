	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Music Box with an Adaptec SCSI controller and the ASPI4DOS.SYS
	device driver, Music Box may take a long time to read the track information. The
	slowness is due to the combination of the Adaptec SCSI controller and the
	ASPI4DOS.SYS device driver. Other controllers do not seem to have this problem.
