	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Neither the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 IBM Quietwriter III driver version
	1.0, nor the Windows version 3.0 IBM Quietwriter III driver version 2.04,
	support the IBM Quietwriter III's Enhanced printing mode.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The IBM Quietwriter III supports three printing modes: standard, quality, and
	enhanced. The Quietwriter is a film ribbon printer, and when adjusted properly,
	it produces excellent output in all three modes. There is very little difference
	in print speed between the three modes; therefore, the lack of support for
	enhanced-mode printing should not affect printing performance or quality.
	
	The Quietwriter is manufactured by IBM, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
