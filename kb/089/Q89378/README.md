	=======
	
	The Powerplus Champ Mouse has a switch on the bottom near the roller. The switch
	must be set to Ms to be used in Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Champ Mouse is a switchable device. The settings are:
	
	- PC
	
	- Ms
	
	If the Champ Mouse is in PC mode, the mouse is functional in MS-DOS applications,
	but not in Windows. If set in Ms mode, it will work in Windows using the
	Microsoft or IBM PS/2 device driver for Windows.
	
	A driver is supplied with the Champ Mouse for operation under MS-DOS. Contact
	Powerplus technical support at (512) 443-3372.
	
	Ensure that the mouse is used over smooth surfaces because the mode switch is
	sensitive to uneven and coarse surfaces.
	
	For additional technical support for this mouse, contact Powerplus technical
	support.
	
	The Champ Mouse product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
