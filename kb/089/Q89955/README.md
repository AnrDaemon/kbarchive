	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Choosing the End Task button in Windows Task Manager (accessed by pressing
	CTRL+ESC) does not close Sound Finder. The End Task button restores Sound Finder
	rather than closing it. Once Sound Finder appears, you can close it by
	double-clicking the Control menu (-) or pressing ALT+F4.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Sound Finder does not close from Task Manager because it depends on several
	child dialog boxes to make changes to labels, descriptions, and pictures. As a
	result, Sound Finder presents you with a final opportunity to review and, if
	necessary, verify or change these settings.
