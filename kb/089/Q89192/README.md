	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you try to run Windows version 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode on a LANtastic
	network with Digital Research's DR DOS version 6.0, you may receive the
	following error message:
	
	  Insufficient memory to initialize Windows in enhanced mode.
	
	To work around this problem, you must obtain a patch from LANtastic.
	
	Note: Microsoft has tested the Microsoft Windows operating system on MS-DOS and
	PC-DOS versions 3.1 and later. However, we cannot ensure the success of running
	Windows with DR DOS from Digital Research(R).
