	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To install Windows Sound System over a network, do the following:
	
	1. Copy the contents of each Windows Sound System disk into a shared network
	  directory. Copy the subdirectories from each disk as well, preserving the
	  subdirectory structure in the shared network directory.
	
	2. From the MS-DOS command prompt of the shared network directory, type "setup"
	  (without the quotation marks), and press ENTER.
	
	3. Follow the normal installation procedure. When Setup asks for each new disk,
	  substitute the shared network directory path for the floppy drive path.
