	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Net Watcher, vertical lines appear in the share name when you scroll the
	share window and when the client window is active. If you enlarge the client
	window (on the left) so that the share window (on the right) cannot display a
	full share name, scroll bars appear. If you have a client name selected when you
	scroll the share window, vertical lines appear, drawn through the share name.
	The same is true for the client window if the share window is enlarged and
	active.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups Net
	Watcher version 3.1 and version 3.11.
	
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
