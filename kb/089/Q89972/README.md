	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When Windows Sound System accesses sound files over the network, it does not use
	the uniform naming convention (UNC); you must specify the drive letter and
	directory.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Sound Finder in Windows Sound
	System versions 1.0, 1.0a, and 2.0. We are researching this problem and will
	post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
