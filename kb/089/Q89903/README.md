	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you open a file in Windows Sound System Quick Recorder, files in the
	current directory are listed if they have a .WAV (waveform) file extension. If
	you change this extension and load a file with a different extension, Quick
	Recorder does not maintain your alternate file extension changes. The next time
	you open a file, only files with .WAV extensions are listed.
