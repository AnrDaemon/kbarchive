	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Text in Microsoft Mail messages that have been received cannot be edited or
	modified within that Mail form.
	
	The text can be selected and copied into another Mail message and then edited or
	taken to another application. Text that is cut will not be removed from the
	response section of the Mail form, and the operation behaves like a copy.
