	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If Microsoft Mail is set up as a remote workstation on a Macintosh Portable and
	you are being continually disconnected from the network, this means that the
	Portable is probably going into Sleep mode during pauses in the communication
	session.
	
	To correct this situation, turn on the Stay Awake When Plugged In option if the
	Portable is plugged in.
	
	For more information, see the "Macintosh Portable Owner's Guide."
