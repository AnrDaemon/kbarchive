	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The PostScript printer driver version 3.2 prints em dashes and en dashes
	incorrectly. The em dash (ALT+0150) displays correctly on the screen but prints
	as a short dash. The en dash (ALT+0151) also displays correctly on screen but
	prints as a long dash. You can print an em (long) dash by entering the code for
	an en dash and then entering at least two spaces before typing the text that
	follows it. If you use the em code to get an en dash, it leaves a space before
	the text that follows the dash.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	An em dash is a typographer's term for a dash that measures one "em" long and is
	approximately as wide as it is tall. An en dash is half as long as an em dash.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows 3.0 PostScript
	printer driver version 3.2. This problem was corrected and does not occur in
	later versions.
