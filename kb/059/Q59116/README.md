	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If a custom form is compiled and the From field is not named "from", Microsoft
	Mail will give a message stating there is not enough memory available when the
	form is used. To correct this problem, open the form in the Form Designer,
	rename the From field to "from", and recompile the form.
