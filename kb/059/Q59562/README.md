	The following sentence describing the INSTR function on Page 138 of
	the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Programmer's Guide" for Microsoft BASIC
	Professional Development System (PDS) Versions 7.00 and 7.10 is
	incorrect. The second sentence under the "Searching for Strings"
	paragraph states the following:
	
	   The INSTR(stringexpression1$, stringexpression2$) function tells
	   you whether or not string2 is contained...
	
	This sentence should be changed to refer to stringexpresion2$ instead
	of string2, as follows:
	
	   The INSTR(stringexpression1$, stringexpression2$) function tells
	   you whether or not stringexpression2$ is contained...
