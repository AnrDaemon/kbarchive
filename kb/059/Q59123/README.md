	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Having more than 32 nodes on a single AppleTalk segment can cause unpredictable
	results, such as a Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks server hang and/or
	System hangs on connected workstations.
	
	The AppleTalk network can support a maximum of 32 nodes on a single segment.
	Additionally, the maximum network cable length is 1000 feet for that segment.
	
	There are many devices that can be used to overcome these limitations. Please
	contact your local dealer for information on these.
	
	Several companies make devices that overcome the standard AppleTalk limitations.
	If you are using one of these devices, make sure the network is set up according
	to the specifications for the device.
