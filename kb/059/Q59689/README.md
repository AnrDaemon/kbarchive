	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you install Microsoft Windows 3.0 in a directory with an extension, such as
	C:\HOME.DIR, Windows Setup does not add the directory to your path.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You have the option of manually adding the directory to your path, but we do not
	recommend installing Windows 3.0 in a directory with an extension. Many
	applications do not correctly handle such a directory and may not function
	properly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.00. This
	problem does not occur in later versions of the product.
