	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	On a Macintosh Portable, trying to read Mail messages might cause the error
	"AppleTalk must be re-connected via the Chooser before Microsoft Mail can be
	used." To correct this problem, open and close the Chooser.
	
	When the Macintosh Portable goes into Sleep mode to save the battery's charge,
	the AppleTalk connection is lost. The amount of time before the Portable goes
	into automatic sleep can be set in the Control Panel in the section called
	"Portable." Adjust the System Minutes To Sleep setting to a different value.
