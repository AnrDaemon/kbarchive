	The Control Panel Color Scheme dialog box is not repainted properly if it is
	overlapped by another window when the Color Palette button is chosen. The
	following steps illustrate this problem:
	
	1. Run the Control Panel and choose the Colors icon.
	
	2. Overlap the Colors window with another application's window (Notepad, for
	  example), leaving the Color Palette button visible.
	
	3. Choose the Color Palette button.
	
	The resulting dialog box has a blank section where the window was overlapping.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This
	problem was corrected in later versions of Windows.
