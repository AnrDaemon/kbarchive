	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The XyWrite editor uses the ALT+TAB key combination to bring up a tab table. For
	this function to work properly, the PIF file for XyWrite should disable the
	ALT+TAB combination.
	
	NOTE: There is a button to disable ALT+TAB in both modes of a PIF file. One for
	Enhanced mode in Advanced options, and one for Standard/Real mode. Make sure the
	right one (or both) is checked.
