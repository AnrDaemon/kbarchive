	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The 3Com 3+Share network has a message service to send and receive messages
	between users. This is loaded as a TSR (terminate and stay resident) program and
	doesn't work properly with Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
	
	Attempting to send a message to a user running Windows 3.0 results in various
	problems, such as being unable to run MS-DOS and Windows applications and being
	unable to print.
