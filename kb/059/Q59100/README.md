	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you sign into a Microsoft Mail server, the username is not case sensitive,
	but the password is case sensitive.
	
	The username can be typed in either uppercase or lowercase letters. The password
	must be typed in exactly the same case as it was when it was set. Check the
	status of the CAPS LOCK key if the password is not accepted.
