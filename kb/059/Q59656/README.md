	You cannot use the Make System Disk option from the Microsoft Windows File
	Manager on a floppy disk that was not formatted under the same version of
	MS-DOS currently being used.
	
	For example, if you have a floppy disk that was originally formatted under
	MS-DOS 3.30 and attempt to make it a system disk on a machine running
	PC-DOS 4.01, the process appears to work but the disk isn't bootable.
	
	NOTE: This is a restriction of MS-DOS, not of Windows.
	
	Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a 3.10 3.11 boot disk bootdisk
