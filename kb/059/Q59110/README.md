	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There are four components of a Microsoft Mail custom form, as follows:
	
	1. Send Screen
	  This is the screen displayed when a user clicks the form's icon in the Summary
	  window icon list.
	
	2. Read Screen
	  This is the screen displayed when the recipient opens a message received with
	  the form.
	
	3. Icons
	  These are the icons associated with the form, a large icon for the Summary
	  window icon list, and a small icon for the message list to indicate the
	  message type.
	
	4. Printed form
	  This form specifies which objects on the form are printed and the order in
	  which they are printed.
