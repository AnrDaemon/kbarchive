	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have a directory window open in File Manager for a given directory and
	rename that directory using the Directory Tree, the window open for that
	directory does not update to reflect the new name. The open window is now
	useless because File Manager tries to use the old path when accessing files in
	that directory, so all operations give "File Not Found" errors.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
