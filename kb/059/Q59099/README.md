	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you receive a Microsoft Mail message similar to the following:
	
	  This message was sent using a custom form that is not installed on your
	  server. Some information from the original message may not be displayed. To
	  view the complete message, ask your network manager to install the form on
	  your server.
	
	Most likely a custom form that is not installed on your server was used to send a
	message from another server.
	
	To correct this problem, have the Network Manager use the Form Designer to
	install the custom form on your server.
