	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
	should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
	Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
	the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
	User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
	Service at (206) 936-8661 but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
	Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
	GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
	server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When adding users to a gateway account so that they can send mail through the
	gateway, a Mail group cannot be added to give everyone in the group access to
	the gateway. This feature is not supported; you must add each user
	individually.
	
	However, a group can be added and made the "default user" for that gateway
	account. This means that everyone in the group will receive any incoming mail
	from the gateway. For more information on how to do this, query on the following
	words:
	
	  " default and user and group " (without the quotation marks)
