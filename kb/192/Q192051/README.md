## Q192051: LDAP Does Not Authenticate on French WinNT Due to Encryption

	Article: Q192051
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): WinNT:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400sp4fix
	Last Modified: 10-AUG-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You are unable to securely authenticate to an LDAP server using applications
	such as Windows Address Book or NetMeeting on the French version of Windows NT
	4.0 when using NTLM. The application may fail to read entries and may return an
	error message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Because LDAP asks for confidentiality for NTLM, DPA, and MSN authentication
	packages, it will not work on the French version of Windows NT.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
	
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	With this fix, LDAP no longer asks for confidentiality when using NTLM.
