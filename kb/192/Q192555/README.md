	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install MSN Internet Access, the option entitled "I want to dial in
	using MSN's network" may not be available when you need to select a method to
	connect to MSN.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you click Cancel when you are prompted to perform one
	of the following actions:
	
	- Select the modem you want to use to connect to MSN.
	
	- Install a modem if a modem is not currently installed on your computer.
	
	This prompt appears on the screen during the Installing Components step of MSN
	Setup.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, first try removing and then reinstalling MSN and if that
	doesn't work, then you need to manually configure your modem.
	
	Reinstall MSN
	-------------
	
	Reinstall MSN and install or select a modem when you are prompted to do so.
	
	NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you use this method if you want to sign up for a
	new MSN account.
	
	Manually Configure Modem
	------------------------
	
	To manually select MSN's network as the default MSN dial-up connection, and then
	install or select a modem. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Double-click the MSN icon on the desktop, and click Settings.
	
	2. On the Options tab, click to select the Use this service for all dial-up
	  Internet access check box, and then click OK.
