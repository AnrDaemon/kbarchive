	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to use the keyboard to move the insertion point from
	one column to the next or to the previous column in a multiple-column Microsoft
	Word document.
	
	NOTE: Word must be in Page Layout View (on the View menu, click Page Layout) for
	you to see columns.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you use columns in a Word document (on the Format menu, click Columns),
	Word inserts newspaper-style columns. That is, the text in a column wraps from
	the bottom of one column to the top of the next column.
	
	To move the insertion point from one column to the next or to the previous column
	on the same page, use the keyboard keys as described in the following table.
	When you move the insertion point by using shortcut keys, Word will move the
	insertion point to the top of the next or to the top of the previous column.
	
	  To move on the same page        Press
	  ----------------------------------------------
	
	  To the next column              ALT+DOWN ARROW
	
	  To the previous column          ALT+UP ARROW
	
	NOTE: Even though you may have formatted your document to have two (or more)
	columns, the additional columns will not yet exist and the shortcut keys to move
	to the next or to the previous column may not work until there is enough text in
	your document to wrap into the additional columns or until you insert a column
	break. To insert a column break, on the Insert menu, click Break, select Column
	Break, and then click OK.
