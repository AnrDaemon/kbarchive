	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you click a Web link in one of the Microsoft programs listed at the
	beginning of this article, the program uses information stored on a Microsoft
	Web server to automatically redirect the Web link if the address for the Web
	site has changed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You no longer need to download a file from the Internet to update the Web links
	in the Internet Directory. The Web link in the program connects to a Microsoft
	Web server that redirects the link to the appropriate Web site.
	
	As Web addresses change, Microsoft updates the redirect information on the
	server.
	
	NOTE: The Help file incorrectly states that you need to download a file from the
	Internet to update the Web links in Bookshelf or Encarta. This was true in
	previous versions of both Bookshelf and Encarta, but the 1998 versions of these
	programs use a redirector on the Microsoft Web site as described above.
