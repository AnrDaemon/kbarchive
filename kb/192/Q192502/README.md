	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Setup program of Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition requires
	a 10-digit CD key. However, the CD key sticker on the back of your jewel case
	may contain an 11-digit CD key.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	It is possible to use the 11-digit CD key that was included with the Visual
	Basic Learning Edition CD-ROM. To do this, you must remove the last digit of the
	first group of four numbers. In other words, if the CD key reads:
	
	  1234-5678907
	
	Remove the "4" and enter the CD key as follows:
	
	  123-5678907
	
	This will allow the product to install correctly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual Basic Deluxe
	Learning Edition.
