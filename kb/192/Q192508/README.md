	Page xiv: Instructions For Installing IE 4.0 Are Missing
	--------------------------------------------------------
	
	Page xiv: paragraph 1:
	
	The paragraph states that the instructions for installing Internet Explorer 4 can
	be found in the section "Using The Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 Step by Step
	CD-ROM". These instructions are missing.
	
	To install Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 from the "Microsoft Internet Explorer
	Step by Step: CD-ROM, follow these steps:
	
	1. Insert the CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive.
	
	2. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	3. In the Open box, type
	
	  <drive>:\ie40\ie4setup
	
	  where <drive> is the drive letter for your CD-ROM drive.
	
	4. Click OK, and follow the directions on the screen.

	The Active Desktop component MSN Investor Ticker is not available at the Active
	Desktop Gallery web page.
	
	The web site address where you find the stock ticker is:

	Solution:
	Follow the steps in the book to step 7, on page 58. The remaining instructions
	are as follows:
	
	7. On the Active Desktop Gallery page, click in the address bar and type "http://iegallery.com/" (without the quotes). The IEGallery page at the
	Microsoft web site appears. 
	8. Select Desktop Component Gallery from the side bar, and then click on
	the link to News and Sports.
	9. The News and Sports Components will appear listed in alphabetical
	order.
	10. Scroll down to the MSN Investor Ticker and click install. The
	Security Alert dialog box appears.
	11. In the Security Alert dialog box, click Yes. The Add Item to
	Active Desktop dialog box appears.

	installation begins. You can monitor the progress of the installation
