	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Exchange Server, directory replication between servers in the same
	site or in different sites is object based, and not attribute based.
	
	Hence, any change to an object in the directory results in the replication of the
	entire object, and not just the attribute that was changed.
