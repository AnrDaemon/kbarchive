	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Deluxe Learning Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Learn Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Now CD-ROM includes sample files for the
	book "Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Step by Step." However, you may not be able to
	access these files directly from the CD-ROM.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design. The Visual Basic 6 Step by Step files are located in
	a self-extracting file on the Learn Visual Basic Now CD-ROM. You must run the
	self-extracting file to install the practice files to your hard drive before you
	can use them.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The following steps are adapted from the "Installing and Using the Practice
	Files" section of "Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Step by Step," beginning on page
	xv:
	
	1. Remove the Learn Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Now CD-ROM from the Microsoft
	  Visual Basic 6.0 Learning Edition jewel case. Note that the Visual Basic 6.0
	  Learning Edition jewel case contains two CD-ROMs. To find the Learn Microsoft
	  Visual Basic 6.0 Now CD-ROM, gently lift the black CD- holder away from the
	  jewel case. The Learn Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Now CD-ROM is on the back of
	  the black CD holder.
	
	2. Insert the CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive.
	
	  On many systems, Windows will automatically recognize that you have inserted a
	  CD, and start running one of the programs on the CD. If this happens, click
	  Cancel, confirm that you want to cancel the installation, and click Finish.
	
	3. On the taskbar at the bottom of your screen, click the Start button, and then
	  click Run.
	
	4. If you have the Deluxe Learning Edition, type d:\vb6sbs\vb6sbs.exe in the
	  Open box.
	
	  -or-
	
	  If you have the standard Learning Edition, type d:\inaction\vb6sbs.exe in the
	  Open box.
	
	  Don't add spaces as you type. (If your CD-ROM drive is associated with a
	  different drive letter, such as e, type it instead of d.)
	
	5. Click OK. This will open a self-extracting ZIP file.
	
	6. Click Unzip to accept the preselected settings to copy the Microsoft Visual
	  Basic 6.0 Step by Step accompanying files to the proper location on your hard
	  drive.
	
	7. When the files have been installed, click OK, and then click Close. Remove
	  the CD-ROM from your CD-ROM drive and replace it in its jewel case.
	
	  A folder called \Vb6sbs has been created on your hard disk, and the practice
	  files have been placed in that folder.
