	version to a Standard or Enterprise version of Exchange Server. MSDN is
	hardcoded for 10 licenses. The MSDN version is meant for a development
	environment. To go to a production environment, you must re-install Exchange
	Server with the Standard or Enterprise version.

	When you re-install Exchange Server, to preserve mail that is already in a
	mailbox, mail can be downloaded to a personal folder file (.pst) file by logging
	into each user's mailbox.
