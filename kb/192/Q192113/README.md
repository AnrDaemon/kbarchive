	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the order in which items in the Startup folder are
	processed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In earlier versions of Windows, you can control the load order of the Startup
	group by the order in which the icons are placed in the Startup group. Windows
	3.x loads Windows-based programs starting from left to right. After loading all
	the Windows-based programs, Windows 3.x then continues loading MS-DOS-based
	programs from left to right. In Windows 95, the order in which programs in the
	Startup folder are loaded is determined by the names of the programs. Programs
	in the Startup folder are loaded in alphabetical order.
	
	To control the load order in the Startup folder, you can rename the icons so that
	they are arranged in the order in which you want them to load.
