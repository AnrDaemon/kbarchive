	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Print dialog box in PowerPoint gives you two options for black and white
	printing. These options are called Black AND White, and Pure Black And White,
	respectively.
	
	You can use the Black And White option for printing your slide as a gray-scale
	representation of the color version you see on the screen. Or, you can use the
	Pure Black And White option for printing the entire presentation in black and
	white only. In other words, all shades of gray are changed to either black or
	white.
