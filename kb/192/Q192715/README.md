	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When using Microsoft Outlook Web Access and setting up an appointment in the
	calendar, the default time for an initial appointment is set to the half hour
	increment that is nearest the system clock on the OWA server. If however, the
	All Day check box is checked, and then subsequently unchecked, the default time
	for the appointment will change to the time that is set in Options as the
	Business day starting time.
