	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Encarta Virtual Globe also may not start if a wave audio file is playing when
	you attempt to start the program.
	
	Encarta Virtual Globe plays wave audio files while its introductory screen is
	loading. If Media Player and other files needed to play wave audio files are
	being used by another program, Encarta Virtual Globe may not start.
	
	To resolve this problem, quit any other programs that may be playing wave audio
	files before you attempt to start Encarta Virtual Globe.
