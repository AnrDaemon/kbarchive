	- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The documentation for the Microsoft Script Control 1.0 states that the Script
	Control supports an Immediate Window and a Macro Run Dialog box. However, you
	cannot open an Immediate Window or a Macro Run Dialog box for the Script
	Control. Further, there is no documentation on how to open an Immediate Window
	or a Macro Run Dialog box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	These features are supported but not currently implemented. Therefore, you
	cannot open an Immediate Window or a Run Macro dialog box for the Script
	Control.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
