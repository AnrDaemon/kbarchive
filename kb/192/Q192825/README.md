	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This information can be used for preliminary research. In many cases, the answer
	may already be posted as a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) article or posted
	answer. E-mail addresses and newsgroup names are included in the search
	results.
	
	The Deja News tool can be useful in almost any research project and allows you to
	search multiple newsgroups simultaneously for key words. The returned items are
	first displayed by confidence of search query and the entire thread is available
	to view. Search results may also be viewed by subject, forum, date, or author by
	selecting "view results in list format." It is possible to view other postings
	by author. Look for your favorite posting authors and see what else they have
	written on the subject. E-mail can also be sent from within the tool to those
	who have posted information on the issue.
	
	One advantage is that the search tool is not limited to Visual FoxPro or any one
	Visual Studio product. It can be used to look for issues with FoxPro or subjects
	related to a FoxPro issue. Examples are API, ODBC, SourceSafe, Visual Basic, NT,
	Windows 98, Oracle, and Novell. This gives you a single place to look at
	postings from hundreds of newsgroups on computer-related issue.
	
	Deja News is a resource for finding people with similar interests and getting
	answers to all sorts of questions. You can find discussion forums on any topic
	imaginable, and search messages dating back more than two years. Because they
	use advanced technology to filter "spam" from their database, you'll get
	relevant search results quickly and easily.
