	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The FrontPage Editor does not show the correct title in the Title bar.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when you import and rename a text (.txt) file by changing
	the file extension to .htm in FrontPage Explorer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	In FrontPage Editor, type a title in the Title box on the General tab in the
	Page Properties dialog box (click Page Properties on the File menu) or in the
	Page Title box in the Save As dialog box (click Save As on the File menu).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you create a new page in FrontPage Editor, the page is assigned a default
	title based on the template you used to create it. For example, a blank page
	based on the normal template will be assigned the following title:
	
	  [Untitled Normal Page].
	
	NOTE: In FrontPage the default title is based on the text you entered on the
	first line of the page.
