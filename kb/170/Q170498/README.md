	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In FrontPage Explorer, you can manage access to FrontPage Web files in the
	Permissions dialog box on the Tools menu. These permissions are applied at the
	Web level only. Tighter control of permissions on subfolders or files is not
	available.
	
	By design, when FrontPage Editor saves an edited file, the original file is
	deleted and it is replaced by a temporary copy created during the editing
	process. When the new file is placed in the directory on the Web server it
	inherits the access control settings of the FrontPage Web into which it was
	saved.
