	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To disable the "Windows NT Workstation" banner, use the following steps.
	
	NOTE: Depending on the configuration of your ZAK Appstation, you may be required
	to log on with administrative privledges to perform these steps.
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Taskbar.
	
	2. Click the "Show small icons in Start menu" check box to select it.
	
	3. Click OK.
