	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In page layout view, if you show the Document Map, and you then insert and cut a
	shape object, Word 97 may stop responding.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).
	
	To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	Turn off the Document Map before inserting and cutting the object by clicking
	Document Map on the View menu.
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	After inserting the object, perform some other action before cutting the object.
	
	Method 3
	--------
	
	Instead of inserting and cutting the object in just two steps, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Insert the object and make sure that it is selected.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.
	
	3. Press DELETE to delete the object.
	
	NOTE: The object can now be pasted just as if the Cut command were used.
