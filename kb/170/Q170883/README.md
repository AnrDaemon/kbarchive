	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The NTSVC.OCX control is a sample control that is provided with the January 1997
	edition of the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). The MSDN article entitled "NT
	Service: An OLE Control for Creating Windows NT Services in Visual Basic,"
	describes an OLE Control that enables developers to create Microsoft Visual
	Basic applications that function as Microsoft Windows NT services.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The OLE control's Microsoft Visual C++ source code is provided. Use of the code
	is unsupported and, as such, a compiled OCX is not supplied. This tool is not
	supported by Microsoft Corporation. It is provided "AS IS." For more information
	about using the OLE Controls Framework to author new OLE controls, see
	\MSDNSMPL\TECH\OLE\CONTROLS\README.TXT on Disk 2 of the MSDN.
