	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.0 SP1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using the Delivery Restrictions tab on the properties of a mailbox, if a
	custom recipient is selected in the Accept Messages From or Reject Messages From
	list boxes, it will be ignored.
	
	In addition, setting delivery restrictions for a custom recipient's mailbox will
	not work. This behavior is by design.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
	Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
	pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
