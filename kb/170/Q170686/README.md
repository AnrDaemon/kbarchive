	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Text in a document is not discernible from the background even when the text is
	selected (highlighted). When the text is selected, you see large blocks of
	highlighted text, but you are unable to see the text.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when the text is formatted with the same color as the page
	background color.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	In order to view the text in the document, the text color must differ from the
	page background color. To change the text color, follow these steps:
	
	1. Select the text.
	
	2. On the Format menu, click Font or Character (depending on your version of
	  Word).
	
	3. Change the font color to Auto or to any color other than the current page
	  background color.
