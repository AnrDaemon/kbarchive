	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Help buttons in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program do not have
	accelerator key's assigned to them.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Normally, the letter "H" on the Help menu is underligned, indicating that you
	can press the ALT+H keys on the keyboard simultaneously to select the Help
	button. Help buttons in the Administrator program do not have this
	functionality. This behavior has existed since Microsoft Exchange Server version
	4.0, and is by design.
