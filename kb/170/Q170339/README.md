	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Word 97 to open a Microsoft Word 7.0 document containing a cropped
	picture or object, one of the following may occur:
	
	- The cropped picture or object reverts to its original size when the document
	  is saved in the Microsoft Word 97 file format.
	
	  -or-
	
	- When you scroll past the cropped picture, the following error message may be
	  displayed:
	
	  The dimensions after cropping are too small or too large
	
	NOTE: If the picture or object was cropped smaller than the original size in
	Microsoft Word 7.0, it becomes larger in the Microsoft Word 97 file format. If
	the picture or object was cropped larger than the original size in Microsoft
	Word 7.0, it becomes smaller in the Microsoft Word 97 file format. Resizing the
	picture or object in Microsoft Word 97 does not correct this problem.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).
	
	To work around this problem, delete the picture or object from the Word 97
	document, reinsert it, and then crop it.
