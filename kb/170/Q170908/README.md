	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some developers may desire to use the Advanced Security features of Microsoft
	Exchange Server without user interaction, from within their application
	programs. Key Management Service does not provide any means to accomplish this
	task.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Specifically, Key Management Service does not expose any APIs, nor interfaces,
	nor provide a Software Development Kit for use toward developing programmatic
	control of Advanced Security. Thus, the functionality of Key Management Service
	is available strictly to end users, rather than application developers.
