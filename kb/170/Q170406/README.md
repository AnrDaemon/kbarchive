	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Allow fast saves option allows Word 97 to save documents quickly by
	appending changes to the end of a file on the hard disk instead of rewriting the
	entire file during a save operation. Since a Background Save option has been
	added to Word 97, the Allow fast saves option is no longer necessary, because
	the save operation occurs in the background.
