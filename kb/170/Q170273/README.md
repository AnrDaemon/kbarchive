	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to use The Magic School Bus (MSB) Explores the
	Rainforest Toolbox to complete the Rainforest replication in the classroom.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The classroom for MSB Rainforest has two sides. You can move from side to side
	by clicking the green mechanical lizard. When you click on any of the children
	in the classroom, they will tell you information about the Rainforest. Most of
	the objects in the classroom will perform some type of trick when you click on
	them. From the right side of the classroom you can click on the bus to begin
	your adventure.
	
	Sitting on the table next to Wanda on the right side of the classroom, you will
	see the Rainforest Toolbox. This toolbox will go with you to every rainforest
	scene throughout the program. The Toolbox is useful not only to help you learn
	about the Rainforest, but also to help you complete the Rainforest replication.
	
	In the toolbox you will find:
	
	- A microphone to listen to specific sounds made in the Rainforest.
	- A magnifying glass to see certain things close-up.
	- A net that you can catch insects with.
	- A telescope that allows you to see a movie (.avi) about certain plants and
	  animals.
	- A book that will pronounce the name of objects when you click on them.
	
	  NOTE: These functions will only work when your mouse cursor is linking and
	  flashing.
	
	When you go to a rainforest scene, for example the Understory, and you click the
	book in the toolbox, the book will only flash and buzz on certain plants and
	animals. You can only use the book to hear a pronunciation on the objects that
	flash and buzz. In some scenes, you may only get one or two things to click on
	with one tool, while you get many more things to click on with another tool.
	
	There are four numbered buttons on the panel of the Rainforest Toolbox. Each
	button gives you clues to help you find the missing samples for the Rainforest
	replica in the classroom. Once you get the clues you must try to find the
	missing object.
	
	Attached to the right side of the Rainforest Toolbox is the biocloning probe.
	Clicking on the Biocloner will turn your mouse cursor into a probe. Once your
	mouse cursor is a probe, you can move it over anything you think might be the
	missing object according to the Toolbox clues. When you are correct, the probe
	will flash and buzz. When you click on the correct object, it will be placed in
	the Rainforest Toolbox. Once you have discovered all four of the missing
	objects, return to the classroom to complete the Rainforest replication, turning
	both sides of the classroom into a rainforest.
