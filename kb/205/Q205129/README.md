	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you view a Virtual Tour in Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Macintosh on a 68K
	series Macintosh computer, the flashlight pointer that indicates the direction
	in which you are looking is not displayed. If you view a Virtual Tour on a Power
	Macintosh computer, the flashlight pointer is displayed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	Because this feature requires a large number of processor (CPU) cycles, it is not
	enabled for 68K series Macintosh computers, which are based on slower
	processors.
