	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Press ALT+TAB
	-------------
	
	Pressing ALT+TAB displays a list of running programs. If you release the TAB key
	and continue holding down the ALT key, the list of programs stays on the screen
	with a particular program selected. If you continue to hold the ALT key down you
	can use the TAB key to move through the list of programs. When you release both
	keys, the program that is currently selected becomes the active program.
	
	Create a Shortcut Key
	---------------------
	
	Right-click your shortcut, and then click Properties. On the Shortcut tab, click
	in the Shortcut Key box. Press any key and it automatically completes the
	keystroke needed. For example, if you press N, "CTRL+ALT+N" is automatically
	inserted. Pressing CTRL+ALT+N then starts this shortcut.
	
	Note that this does not work with Microsoft Word 97.
	
	
	Use Task Manager
	----------------
	
	Start Task Manager (the method for starting Task Manager varies, depending on
	which operating system you are using. Check your operating system's
	documentation or online Help). On the Application tab, click the program you
	want, and then click Switch To.
