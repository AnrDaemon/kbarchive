	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	During installation of Microsoft Windows 3.0, your Hyundai 386 system stops
	responding (hangs) when you insert Disk 2.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Hyundai technical support has confirmed that Hyundai 386 computers have a
	problem with Toshiba floppy drives. Using a Toshiba floppy drive causes an
	invalid configuration error in the CMOS setup.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Disable the Toshiba floppy drive in the computer's CMOS setup to allow Microsoft
	Windows version 3.0 to install and run properly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Hyundai 386 computers are shipped with a 5.25-inch floppy drive. A dealer or
	owner may add a second floppy drive, usually a 3.5-inch drive. If a Toshiba
	floppy drive is added, an error occurs in the CMOS setup.
	
	Hyundai is researching this problem, and recommends that another brand of floppy
	drive be used in its systems.
	
	NOTE: There is no known external means of determining whether a Toshiba drive is
	in the system. Opening the computer and looking at the label on the drive is the
	only way to identify the drive.
	
	For information on running the CMOS setup, please refer to your Hyundai manual.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these product's performance
	or reliability.
