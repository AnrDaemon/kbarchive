	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You may have difficulty editing a line in Write if you try to insert blank
	spaces at the beginning of the line. Write will not allow you to insert a space
	at the beginning of a line if the line above it does not have a hard return
	(produced by pressing ENTER) at the end of the line.
	
	This is not a problem with Write, it is a common occurrence in all word
	processors.

	================
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Open Write from the Accessories group.
	
	2. Type a paragraph.
	
	3. Go to the beginning of a line that is at the left margin and position the
	  cursor on the left margin. Press the SPACEBAR to insert a blank space at the
	  beginning of the line. You will see the cursor jump back to the left margin,
	  and not allow a space to be entered.
	
	NOTE: Blank spaces are produced by pressing the SPACEBAR and not by pressing the
	TAB key. If you need to insert blank spaces without a hard return at the
	previous line, you can use the TAB key.
