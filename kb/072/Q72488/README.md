	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Compaq laptops, such as the 286LTE, have the option of switching between the
	built-in screen and an external monitor. However, this does not work if you are
	inside Microsoft Windows.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows captures all keystroke commands, which prevents this feature from
	working.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only work around at this time is to execute the command before starting
	Windows.
	
	The commands to switch between the built-in screen and the external monitor port
	are:
	
	  enable:  CTRL+ALT+, (comma)
	  disable: CTRL+ALT+. (period)
