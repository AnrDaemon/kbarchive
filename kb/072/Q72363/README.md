	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you convert a Microsoft Windows versions 2.x MSP file to a BMP file through
	Windows version 3.0 Paintbrush, the size of the image is reduced approximately
	37 percent. (Windows 3.0 Paintbrush automatically converts the file format from
	MSP to BMP when the file is opened.)
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	1. Use the Pick tool to select the image area.
	
	2. From the Pick menu, choose Shrink + Grow and resize the image.
	
	NOTE: This method does not work with some large images.
