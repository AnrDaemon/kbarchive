	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When running Setup for the Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP), you may receive the
	following error message:
	
	  There was an error copying files to your <WINDOWS DIR> subdirectory.
	  Please correct the problem and run Setup again.
	
	This error message normally occurs if there is not enough free disk space to
	install the Windows Entertainment Pack. However, you may receive this error if
	there is ample disk space for Setup.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you have ample disk space for Setup, a workaround is to create a new
	directory and to copy the files from the Entertainment Pack disk(s) into this
	new directory. Then run the Entertainment Pack Setup directly from the hard
	drive.
	
	For more information, query on Entertainment Pack and Error.
