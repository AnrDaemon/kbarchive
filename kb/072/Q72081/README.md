	Genoa has a video utility called TUNE.EXE or ATUNE.EXE (for automatic), that
	optimizes data transfers to the screen. If your screen jitters in Microsoft
	Windows, it may be caused by one of these utilities.
	
	Genoa technical support recommends removing the line referring to these utilities
	from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The line reads:
