	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you maximize a windowed MS-DOS prompt and press RETURN until you move the
	cursor to the last line in the window, the flashing cursor disappears. The
	Window is completely functional and any text you type is visible. The flashing
	underscore cursor is below the bottom edge of the MS-DOS prompt window.

	drivers, Video Seven VGA with 512K, and VGA with monochrome display. Other video
	drivers, including third-party drivers, may also exhibit this problem.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To solve the problem, use a Windows 3.0 display driver other than the Video
	Seven VGA with 512K or the VGA with monochrome display.
	
	STATUS
