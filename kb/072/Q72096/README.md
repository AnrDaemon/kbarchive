	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MS-DOS Upgrade and MS-DOS Step-Up are the only MS-DOS packages that Microsoft
	sells through retail stores. Although Microsoft is not currently taking legal
	action against stores that sell MS-DOS in violation of the licensing agreement,
	we are tracking this problem. If you know of a retailer that is selling MS-DOS
	illegally, please report it to Microsoft by calling (800) NO-COPYN (NO-COPYN
	translates to 662-6796).
	
	Please note that it is absolutely legal to purchase the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 and
	later Upgrades and the MS-DOS 6.2 and later Step-Up products available in retail
	stores.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
