	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your Austin computer boots in standard or real mode, but not in the enhanced
	mode of Microsoft Windows 3.0, or your Windows displays the blue logo screen and
	then stops responding (hangs).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Tseng Labs makes a video card that comes standard with Austin computers. This
	video card needs to have a BIOS dated 4/90 or later to run Microsoft Windows
	version 3.0 in enhanced mode. An older BIOS causes the symptoms above.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Obtain an updated BIOS from Austin Computer Systems.
