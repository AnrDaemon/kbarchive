	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A bitmap (.BMP) file created in Paintbrush appears not to center or tile on your
	desktop if the image attributes in Paintbrush were not set to the correct size
	of the image.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the attributes are not set to the correct size, the blank desktop space in
	Paintbrush will be saved as part of the image. Consequently, when the file is
	brought up as wallpaper, the image will not appear to be tiled or centered
	because of the Paintbrush workspace that was saved with the image. However, the
	image actually is tiled or centered.
	
	To get the desired results, the image attributes must be set before the image is
	drawn.
