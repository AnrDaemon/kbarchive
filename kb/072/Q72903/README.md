	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) has a line of electrostatic plotters designated series
	7600. These are high-speed, high-volume printers that use laser-like technology
	to print full-size drawings in less than one minute. These drawings are at a 406
	dpi resolution with 64 shades of gray. When printing in full-color, it takes
	less than eight minutes for a full-size drawing. These times do not include
	transmission time.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	These plotters have three built-in interfaces. They are the RS-232 serial, IEEE
	488-1978 parallel, and Centronics parallel. They use the HP-GL/2 command
	language and will emulate HP-7586B plotters when used with most DOS applications
	or Microsoft Windows. They are designed primarily for use with graphics
	workstations. The internal rasterizer uses a 32-bit Motorola 68020 and a
	40-megabyte hard disk.
	
	There are three models available at this time:
	
	- 
	
	  Model 250       B/W     24-inch wide plots
	
	- 
	
	  Model 255       B/W     36-inch wide plots
	
	- 
	
	  Model 355       Clr     36-inch wide plots
	
	As with all HP printers or plotters, use an HP cable to ensure that the printer
	will function properly.
