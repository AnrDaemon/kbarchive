	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following is a list of Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP) files that differ in
	size, after installation, between versions 1.0 and 1.0a:
	
	  Filename        1.00    1.00a
	  --------        -----   -----
	
	  ABOUTTET.DLL    10128   10224
	  IDLEWILD.EXE    12800   12928
	  IWLIB.DLL        7550    7518
	  TETRIS.EXE      62032   64784
	  TIC.EXE         20706   16944
	  WINMINE.EXE     31248   26976
	
	If the original disks are unavailable, the easiest way to distinguish between
	Windows Entertainment Pack versions is to look at the sizes of the files on the
	hard disk. The file dates of these files reflect the system-clock date at the
	time of installation.
