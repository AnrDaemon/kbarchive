	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You may not be able to determine the mode Microsoft Windows version 3.0 is
	running in if you are using a shell other than Program Manager. For example,
	using the MS-DOS Executive as the Windows shell allows you to determine the
	amount of memory and resources, as well as the disk space, but not the current
	mode.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are two ways to find out what mode Windows is in:
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	From inside Windows, run WINVER.EXE.
	
	NOTE: Running WINVER.EXE from MS-DOS returns only the version of Windows, not the
	mode.
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	Start File Manager and choose About File Manager from the Help menu.
