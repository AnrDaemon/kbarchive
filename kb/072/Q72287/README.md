	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The AppActivate command activates the specified window in a program other than
	Microsoft Word. Use AppActivate to switch to another program that is already
	running or that you have started by using Shell. To activate a window within
	Microsoft Word, use the Activate command.
	
	NOTE: If the other program is minimized, the AppActivate command will not
	maximize that program; it simply gives that program the focus and then returns
	the focus to Word.
