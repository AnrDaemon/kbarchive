	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The legality of purchasing MS-DOS version 5.0 can seem confusing. This is
	because Microsoft has two "MS-DOS 5.0"s.
	
	Like earlier versions of Microsoft MS-DOS, Microsoft MS-DOS 5 is not available
	for retail sale. It is licensed to computer manufacturers to be sold with a
	computer, or to be purchased as an upgrade from the manufacturer.
	
	The Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade, however, is a retail product that is not being
	licensed to computer manufacturers. There is nothing wrong with purchasing the
	Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade at a retail outlet.
	
	The MS-DOS 5 Upgrade will upgrade a previous version of MS-DOS or PC-DOS to
	MS-DOS version 5.0. A previous version of MS-DOS or PC-DOS is required, because
	the MS-DOS 5 Upgrade does not contain a bootable diskette.
