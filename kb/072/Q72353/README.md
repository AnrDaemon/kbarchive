	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print from Microsoft Windows to the IBM Proprinter X24e or XL24e, a
	white line shows through the printed characters. The white line occurs at 11/16
	inch intervals.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You have an old EPROM chip in your printer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, replace the EPROM chip in the printer. This upgrade is
	available from IBM. The updated EPROM chip ID number is 49F5263. NOTE: You need
	to verify that you have the old EPROM.
	
	To verify that an old EPROM is present:
	
	1. Turn off the printer.
	
	2. Make sure that the printer has 8.5-inch or 13-inch paper installed, depending
	  upon whether it's a 4207 or a 4208 (narrow or wide carriage).
	
	3. Press and hold the ProPark button.
	
	4. Turn the printer back on.
	
	5. When the printer starts printing, release the ProPark button.
	
	6. Power the printer off after it has printed one page.
	
	7. Locate the seven-digit alphanumeric part number in the upper-left corner of
	  the printout.
	
	8. If it is NOT 49F5263 and the printer exhibits the "White Line" problem, IBM
	  Service can be called to perform the printer update.
