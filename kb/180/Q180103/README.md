	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 or Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000,
	the instrument panel in the cockpit may appear blurred or difficult to read.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, configure Flight Simulator to use a higher display
	resolution in Full Screen mode, and then switch to Full Screen mode. To do this,
	use the appropriate method for your version of Flight Simulator.
	
	Flight Simulator 2000
	---------------------
	
	1. On the Options menu, point to Settings, and then click Display.
	
	2. On the Hardware tab, click to select the Enable Hardware Acceleration check
	  box.
	
	3. In the Resolution box, click the highest available setting, and then click
	  the CHECK MARK button to return to the cockpit.
	
	4. On the Views menu, click Full Screen.
	
	Flight Simulator 98
	-------------------
	
	1. On the Options menu, click Preferences.
	
	2. On the Display tab, click Display Options.
	
	3. Click the Hardware Acceleration tab.
	
	4. In the Fullscreen Mode box, click the highest available setting, and then
	  click OK until you return to the cockpit.
	
	5. On the Views menu, click Full Screen.
	
	NOTE: If your monitor is correctly configured in the Display tool in Control
	Panel, only display resolutions that are supported by both the display adapter
	and the monitor are available in Flight Simulator. If your monitor is not
	properly configured, you may experience problems if you follow the steps listed
	above. If a monitor is not selected in the Display tool in Control Panel, the
	available display resolutions may be limited to low resolution settings. If an
	incorrect monitor is selected, display resolutions that are not compatible with
	your monitor may be available. Display resolutions that are not compatible with
	your monitor can cause display distortion and eventually damage the monitor.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Full Screen mode can improve performance in Flight Simulator, but high
	resolution settings can degrade performance. Experiment with different display
	resolutions until you find a compatible setting that displays an instrument
	panel that is easy to read and maintains an acceptable level of performance.
