	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you experience a problem with a Microsoft program, you may need to
	reinstall the program to troubleshoot issues that can be caused by missing or
	damaged files. When you reinstall the program, you may be presented with the
	following installation options:
	
	- Reinstall
	- Remove All
	
	The Reinstall installation option reinstalls missing program files, but does not
	recopy program files that already exist on your hard disk. Damaged files, system
	files, and program-supplied fonts are not recopied when you choose the Reinstall
	option.
	
	The Remove All installation option removes all of the program's files, including
	damaged files, but does not remove any files you created using the program. This
	option enables you to reinstall all the program files.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To reinstall a program, run the Setup program from the program disks or CD-ROM.
	Instructions about how to install the program are printed on the disks or the
	CD-ROM jewel case insert. If the program is designed for Windows 95, you can
	also reinstall the program by using the following steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
	
	3. Click the program you want to reinstall, and then click Add/Remove.
	
	If the problem continues to occur after you reinstall the program, first remove,
	and then reinstall the program by using the following steps:
	
	1. Run the Setup program from the program disks or CD-ROM, or run the Setup
	  program using the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel as described in
	  steps 1-3 above.
	
	2. Click Remove All. If you are prompted to confirm the removal, click Yes.
	
	3. Restart the computer.
	
	4. Run ScanDisk to check the hard disk for lost clusters and errors, and to test
	  the integrity of the hard disk. To run ScanDisk, use the following steps:
	
	  a. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	  b. In the Open box, type "scandisk" (without the quotation marks), and then
	     click OK.
	
	  c. Click the hard disk you want to check for errors.
	
	  d. Under Type Of Test, click Thorough, and then click Start.
	
	     NOTE: If you have more than one hard disk installed in your computer, run
	     ScanDisk on each hard disk.
	
	5. If the program is installed from a CD-ROM, gently wipe the underside of the
	  CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cloth to remove any fingerprints, smudges, or
	  dust.
	
	6. Reinstall the program.
	
	NOTE: Any custom program options or preferences you have selected may be removed
	if you follow these steps. However, any documents you have created using the
	program are not removed if you remove and reinstall the program.
