	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use Netscape Navigator to browse the contents of the Encarta 98 Research
	Organizer CD-ROM, the introductory video clip may be loaded very slowly. In
	addition, the instructions describing how to play the introductory video clip do
	not apply if you are using Navigator.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because Navigator must retrieve an entire video clip
	before it can play it. Navigator may take a long time to retrieve the
	introductory video clip in Encarta 98 Research Organizer because the size of the
	video clip is about 32 megabytes (MB).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The instructions describe how to play the introductory video clip in Microsoft
	Internet Explorer, which uses streaming technology to play the video clip as it
	is retrieved from the Encarta 98 Research Organizer CD-ROM.
	
	If you want to use Navigator to browse the contents of the Encarta 98 Research
	Organizer CD-ROM, you must wait for Navigator to retrieve the entire
	introductory video clip from the CD-ROM, and then double-click the video clip to
	play it.
	
	Navigator requires about 55 seconds to retrieve the introductory video clip from
	a 4x CD-ROM drive, but it can retrieve the video clip from a 12x CD-ROM drive in
	less than 18 seconds under ideal conditions.
	
	Netscape Navigator is manufactured by Netscape, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
