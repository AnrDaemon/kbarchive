## Q180399: Missing Outlook 97 CD Key on BackOffice Server 4.0 CD-ROM

	Article: Q180399
	Product(s): Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
	Version(s): WINDOWS:97; winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.0 
	- Microsoft Outlook 97 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	During the installation process of the Outlook 97 client included with
	BackOffice Server 4.0, you are prompted for a CD key. If you type the CD key
	information provided on the BackOffice Server CD-ROM jewel case, you receive the
	following error message:
	
	  This is an invalid CD Key value. Check the identification number from your CD
	  sticker.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Outlook 97 Client Software CD contained within the BackOffice Server 4.0
	Retail and Not for Resale (NFR) CD set requires a separate CD key than the one
	provided on the BackOffice Server 4.0 CD-ROM jewel case. BackOffice Server 4.0
	Retail and NFR do not contain the CD key for the Outlook 97 client.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	BackOffice Server 4.0 NFR
	-------------------------
	
	To work around this problem, use the CD key from the Microsoft Office 97 NFR
	product that is contained in your Direct Access Action Pack (DAAP).
	
	Retail Version of BackOffice Server 4.0
	---------------------------------------
	
	To work around this problem, a Microsoft Customer Service Representative will
	issue you a new 11-digit CD key, which will let you complete the Outlook 97
	client installation.
	
	For the full retail product (FPP) customers, Microsoft will remove the Outlook 97
	CD from the Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.0 CD set and re- release CD number 1
	of the BackOffice Server 4.0 CD set to remove the reference to low encryption.
	The high-encryption version of the Outlook 8.03 client will be added as a
	separate CD to the BackOffice Server 4.0 bill of materials for all FPP server
	software SKUs. It will come in a sleeve with its own CD key.
	
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in some packages of Microsoft
	BackOffice Server version 4.0.
