## Q180776: Windows Messaging Does Not Change Addresses to Hyperlinks

	Article: Q180776
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): WINDOWS:95
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbenv win95

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	NOTE: In this article, the term "Windows Messaging" refers to both
	Microsoft Windows Messaging and Microsoft Exchange.
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you type a Web, Mailto, file transfer protocol (FTP), Gopher, or shell
	folder address in a Windows Messaging e-mail message, nothing happens when you
	click it.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because Windows Messaging does not change these types of
	addresses into hyperlinks.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	Use one of the following e-mail programs instead of Windows Messaging:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server Client (retail version)
	
	- Microsoft Internet Mail (included in Microsoft Internet Mail and News)
	
	- Microsoft Outlook Express
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	Use a word processor (such as Microsoft Word 97) that provides this functionality
	as your default e-mail editor. For information about whether your word processor
	provides this functionality and can be configured as your default e-mail editor,
	consult the documentation included with your word processor.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A shell folder is a resource on your local hard disk or local area network (LAN)
	that can be accessed using the "File:" protocol (for example,
	"file://c:\windows" or "file://\\<path>\webpage.htm," where <path>
	is the full universal naming convention (UNC) path to the Webpage.htm file).
