## Q158054: WD97: Page Number Field Not Marked As Deleted, Reinserted

	Article: Q158054

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you update fields in a Word 97 document while tracking revisions, the page
	number field does not appear as deleted and reinserted. For example, Word does
	not display the page number twice, marked once for deletion (with strikethrough
	formatting) and once for insertion (with underline formatting). Word places a
	revision bar in the margin to indicate that it was updated. This behavior is
	different from previous versions of Word, in which the page number is displayed
	multiple times, once for each field update.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior was changed at the request of Word users.
