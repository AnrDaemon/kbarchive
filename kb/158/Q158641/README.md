	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view your document in online layout view and the document contains a
	large watermark (picture), the line spacing appears greater at the bottom of the
	watermark.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Word resizes the watermark such that it is displayed incorrectly in online
	layout view.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, insert a picture in the background. Word will
	automatically resize the picture so that it is displayed properly in online
	layout view.
	
	NOTE: When you insert a picture using these steps, the picture will appear only
	in online layout view. It will not be printed nor displayed in page layout or
	print preview.
	
	To insert a picture in the background, use the following steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, click Online Layout.
	
	2. On the Format menu, point to Background, and then click Fill Effects.
	
	3. On the Picture tab, click Select Picture. Select the picture you want to use
	  and click OK.
	
	4. Click OK.
