	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you insert a Word table into a PowerPoint presentation, some of the
	gridlines do not display.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The table gridlines are formatted with a 1/2 point line style. Word sends the
	image to PowerPoint at a resolution of 300 dots per inch. This translation
	results in the lines not displaying.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use a thicker line style, such as 1-1/2 points.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
