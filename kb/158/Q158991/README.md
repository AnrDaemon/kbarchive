	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The US Robotics Edgeserver does not support Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Remote
	Access Service (RAS) clients. In order to connect to the US Robotics Edgeserver,
	you must use a point-to-point protocol (PPP) compliant dial-up client.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The US Robotics Edgeserver is a hardware Remote Access Service solution that
	combines Windows NT Server 4.0 within the US Robotics Total Control Enterprise
	Network Hub. Windows NT Server 4.0 is pre-installed on the EdgeServer.
	
	Although the Windows NT 4.0 Remote Access Service Server software supports
	Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS as a dial-up client, when used with the
	Edgeserver, only PPP compliant clients are supported.
