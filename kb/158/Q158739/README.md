	================
	
	You can download 128-bit versions of service packs or networking updates from
	the following Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://support.microsoft.com/support/ntserver/128Eula.asp
	
	The licensing agreement for 128-bit downloads is displayed on this page. After
	you read the agreement, click I Agree to accept and acknowledge that you have
	read and understand the agreement.
	
	After you accept the licensing agreement, the 128-bit download page is displayed
	and you can download a service pack or an update package. To download the
	128-bit version of the latest service pack, click the appropriate link at the
	top of the page. To download 128-bit hotfixes and updates, click any of the
	following items displayed in the drop-down list box:
	
	- Windows NT 4.0 Post-SP3 Hotfix: Updated SChannel.dll -x86

	NOTE: The last two items in the list are not rolled into Windows NT 4.0 Service
	Pack 4 (SP4) because they are updates to Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft
	Windows 98. For all other items, it is recommended that you install SP4 or later
	to correct these problems.
	It is also important to note that the latest service packs include additional
	fixes and service-related updates, including Microsoft Internet Information
	Services (IIS) 4.0 components and Microsoft Internet Explorer components. Please
	refer to the Readme.txt file of the latest service pack to obtain a more
	complete list of fixes that are available.
