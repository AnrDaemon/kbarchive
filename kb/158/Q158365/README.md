	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Third-party scenery packages that are compatible with Flight Simulator 5.0,
	5.0a, and 5.1 are compatible with Flight Simulator for Windows 95. This includes
	the BAO scenery package, Las Vegas.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	User-created scenery created for the earlier versions of Flight Simulator should
	also be compatible. Some problems have been reported in some scenery packages
	when Dynamic scenery is turned on. Turning off Dynamic Scenery should solve the
	problem.
	
	The Microsoft Scenery packages New York and Paris, and the BAO package Las Vegas,
	have been included in the default scenery of Flight Simulator for Windows 95.
	There is no need to run a special Setup for them. The palette issue that allowed
	for compatibility with the Haze feature of Flight Simulator 5.1, has been
	corrected in Flight Simulator 95.
	
	Some Flight Simulator 4.0 scenery may work. This is dependent on the individual
	scenery. There is no workaround to any Flight Simulator 4.0 scenery that does
	not work.
