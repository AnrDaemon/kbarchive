	========
	
	In low memory situations, when you have background printing turned off the Apple
	color printer may print out black vertical lines of varying thickness. Similar
	to a UPC bar code.
	
	If you try decrease the size of the Largest Unused Block to correct this problem,
	Encarta may shut down with a bus error.
