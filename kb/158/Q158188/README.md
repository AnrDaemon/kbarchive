	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains comments, corrections, and information on known errors
	relating to the Microsoft Press book "Hitchhiker's Guide to Visual Basic and SQL
	Server."
	
	The following topics are covered:

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to a description of the book's problems, each entry in this document
	might also include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note
	that the "Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not
	necessarily address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments"
	section contains specific information for working around the problem.
	
	CD-ROM contains short filenames
	-------------------------------
	
	Windows 95 using Real-mode (MS-DOS) CD-ROM drivers and Windows NT 3.51 are both
	unable to read the long filenames on the companion CD-ROM for the book
	"Hitchhiker's Guide to Visual Basic and SQL Server." NAMEXPAN.EXE is a utility
	that copies the short CD-ROM filenames to a hard disk and then renames the short
	filenames to their original long filenames. The following file is available for
	download from the Microsoft Download Center:
	
	  NAMEXPAN.EXE
	  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb40pro/MSPRESS/2.0/WIN98Me/EN-US/NAMEXPAN.EXE)

	Directory missing for CD-ROM contents
	-------------------------------------
	
	There is no directory or list of contents either on the CD-ROM or in this book
	for the accompanying CD-ROM.
	
	Please use the long directory names and long filenames to navigate the content
	provided on this CD-ROM. Microsoft Press is aware of this issue and will provide
	improved contents descriptions in future printings or in a future edition of
	this book.
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
