	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Troubleshooting Game Pad or Joystick Issues:
	
	If your game pad or joystick doesn't work:
	
	- Make sure all connections between your game pad or joystick and computer are
	  properly secured.
	- Make sure that your controller is enabled.
	
	To verify that your controller is enabled:
	
	1. On the Options menu, click Controller.
	
	2. On the Controller tab, make sure that the Enable Controller check box is
	  selected.
	
	3. Although Windows 95 contains several built-in game pad and joystick drivers,
	  you may need to obtain a Windows 95-compatible driver from your game pad or
	  joystick manufacturer.
	
	4. If you continue to have problems, make sure your controller is properly
	  configured.
	
	  To verify that your joystick is properly configured:
	
	  a. On the Options menu, click Controller.
	
	  b. On the Controller tab, click Settings, and then follow the directions in
	     the Configuration dialog box.
	
	MICROSOFT SIDEWINDER GAME PAD
	-----------------------------
	
	You can customize the keys and functions on the Microsoft SideWinder game pad
	using the GEX Controller dialog box or the Microsoft SideWinder game pad
	Profiler. When adding GEX to the Profiler, be sure to use Gex.exe, and not
	Loader.exe.
	
	If you assign the F3 key or Pause to one of the SideWinder game pad buttons, you
	may find that the button works to pause the game, but does not resume play. To
	resume play, press F3 or PAUSE on the keyboard.
