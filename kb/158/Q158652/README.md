	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to play an anthem in Encarta and your computer is running in a low
	memory situation one of the following may occur:
	
	- the anthem may not play.
	
	  -or-
	
	- You receive the following error message:
	
	  There is insufficient free system memory for Encarta to complete this task.
	  See the Encarta 97 Read Me for more assistance.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Encarta is running with less than the suggested memory (listed in the Get Info
	box for the Encarta 97 Encyclopedia icon). The suggested size is a number that
	is set by the developers of the program. This amount cannot be adjusted.
	
	The suggested size is the amount of memory that the program developers decided
	Encarta needed to function optimally. You should always try to set the Preferred
	size to a number at least as large as the suggested size.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Optimize your computer's memory configuration and System memory usage so that
	Encarta 97 is able to run with the preferred amount of memory.
