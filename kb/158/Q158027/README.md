	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following information is the enhancement codes for Hellbender. These
	enhancement codes allow you to warp to different planets, boost your ship's
	strength, make you invincible, or provide you with full weapons. The codes can
	be used by typing the code name (without pressing ENTER) from within the
	Hellbender game.
	
	These codes are implemented for testing and support purposes only. They will be
	leaked at an appropriate time after the product has been shipped to help create
	excitement among gamers. The enhancement codes will not be enabled during
	multiplayer games.
	
	List of the enhancement codes and what they do:
	
	Cheat Code     Effect
	----------     ------
	
	FRAMEIT        Displays a frame counter
	
	TOTLPOWR       Makes main energy 100%
	
	STEROID        Makes the player invincible
	
	URDEAD#        The number (#) represents a number 0 - 9. These correspond
	              to the weapon number a player pushes to get a particular
	              weapon. This code will give the player the desired weapon
	              as if they just picked up that weapon's power up.
	
	              For example: URDEAD1 = Dispersion Cannon
	
	URAGONR        Gives the player the secret weapon
	
	MAXMEUP        Makes the hull 100 percent
	
	IMPUMPD        Gives the player all weapons as if they picked up one
	              power up of each weapon
	
	AUNTEM#        This warps the player to the planet corresponding to
	              the number entered at the end of the code.
	              The numbers will be 1-8.
	
	              For example, AUNTEM2 = Planet EYRIE
	
	IMSTUCK        This skips the current mission and advances the player
	              to the next mission.
