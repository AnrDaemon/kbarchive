	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use a template that contains one or more Microsoft Visual Basic for
	Applications macros, those macros may or may not be added to your current
	presentation. There are two different ways that you can use a template in
	PowerPoint. One method includes macros, the other does not.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Template with Macros
	--------------------
	
	1. If PowerPoint is already running, click New on the File menu. If it is not
	  already running, start PowerPoint, and then click Template in the Startup
	  dialog box.
	
	2. In the list of available templates, click the template that you want to use.
	  Click OK.
	
	3. If you have already created some slides that you want to use in this
	  presentation, you can add them to this new presentation by clicking Slides
	  from File on the Insert menu.
	
	Template Without Macros
	-----------------------
	
	1. Create one or more slides in a new presentation.
	
	2. On the Format menu, click Apply Design.
	
	3. In the list of available templates, click the template that you want to use.
	
	PowerPoint stores macros as part of a presentation file. When you create a new
	presentation based on a template, you are essentially opening an untitled copy
	of the template file. This copy contains all the slides and macro code contained
	in the template. When you apply a template to an existing presentation, only the
	information from the Slide, Title, Notes Pages, and Handout masters is added to
	the presentation. The macro code is not added.
