	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft GEX, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses issues that affect Gex on NexGen chips and processors:
	
	- GEX is not compatible with NexGen chips earlier than the Nx586 model because
	  these chips are 386-class chips that emulate a Pentium. GEX requires a
	  Pentium or better chip.
	
	- There are two minor performance issues related to Windows 95 on the NexGen
	  Nx586 processor. NexGen has addressed these issues by making its Windows CPU
	  Identifier utility available from the NexGen World Wide Web site. You can
	  download the VL and PCI versions of this utility from the following address:
	
	  http://www.amd.com
