	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to view the credits on the Discography screen in Music Central, the
	artist/performer credits seem to be missing.
	
	In the Discography screen, credits listed below the title of a work will display
	the artist/performers contributions to that work.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is by design, but may appear misleading.
	
	NOTE: To view an individual artist/performer's credits, type the name of the
	artist/performer in the Find box, double-click on the artist/performer, and
	click the Credits button.
