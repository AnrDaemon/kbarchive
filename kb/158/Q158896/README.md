	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you create a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro (Sub procedure)
	that you want to use with more than one presentation, you can add a button to
	one of the PowerPoint toolbars to run the macro.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To add a button for a macro to a toolbar, follow these steps:
	
	1. Open the presentation that contains the macro. If you have just added a macro
	  to your current presentation, save your presentation. For this procedure to
	  work, your file must be saved before you create the button.
	
	2. On the Tools menu, click Customize.
	
	3. Click the Commands tab.
	
	4. Click Macros in the Categories list.
	
	5. Drag the name of your macro from the Commands list and drop it on one of your
	  toolbars. This adds a button to the toolbar to run the macro.
	
	6. Click Close.
	
	NOTE: PowerPoint stores macros in presentations. When you click this button, the
	presentation that contains the macro opens in the foreground. If you delete or
	rename the presentation that contains the macro, the button stops working.
