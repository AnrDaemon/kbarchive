	Readme File:
	
	-------------------
	
	To install Encarta 97 Encyclopedia to your hard disk:
	-----------------------------------------------------
	
	1. Insert Encarta 97 Disc 1 into your CD-ROM drive.
	
	2. Double-click the Encarta 97 Disc 1 CD icon that appears on your
	  desktop.
	
	3. Double-click the Install Encarta 97 Encyclopedia icon to launch the
	  Installer.
	
	4. Click the Install button.
	
	NOTE: Some virus protection software may confuse the Installer program's
	necessary actions with behaviors associated with a virus, possibly
	disrupting the installation process. It is recommended that you disable
	any virus protection software before installing Encarta, then enable
	it again after the installation.
	
	Files Installed by the Encarta 97 Encyclopedia Installer:
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Encarta Installer adds all necessary system components to your System
	Folder and copies the Encarta application to a folder named "Encarta 97
	Encyclopedia". The Easy Install also copies Internet Config 1.3 and
	Internet Explorer 2.1 to your hard disk if you don't already have these
	applications installed. Custom installation options are provided for
	users who wish to only install selected components.
	
	The text, sounds, and images remain on the CDs, so you still need to
	insert a CD to run the encyclopedia.
	
	Where the Encarta Installer puts files
	
	When you run Easy Install, the Encarta Installer...
	
	Creates a folder on your hard disk called "Encarta 97 Encyclopedia" and
	copies the following to this folder:
	
	- Encarta 97 Encyclopedia - Encarta application (68K or PPC,
	  depending on your machine)
	
	- Encarta 97 Read Me - document you are reading now
	
	- Notemark Contents - file used by Encarta to store your Notemarks*
	
	- Data Files - folder containing crucial data files needed by
	  Encarta*
	
	- Updates - folder containing the Yearbook update files* (July 1996
	  installed)
	
	Creates a folder called "Encarta 1994 Preferences" in your Preferences
	folder. This folder allows Microsoft Works 4.0 to search Encarta
	Encyclopedia content.
	
	The following system components are copied to your System Folder:
	
	- QuickTime 2.5 - required for Encarta to play movies, animations,
	  music and panoramas*
	
	- Sound Manager 3.2.1 - required to handle audio in QuickTime movies,
	  animations and music*
	
	- Apple Guide 2.0.2 - required to view Encarta's online help*
	
	- Arial, Times New Roman, Symbol, MS Reference, HM Phonetic -
	  required Encarta fonts*
	
	If you don't have a copy of Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.1 or
	later on your hard disk, the following files are installed:
	
	- Internet Explorer 2.1 - folder containing Microsoft's Web browser
	  (68K or PPC, depending on your machine)
	
	- Explorer - folder in Preferences folder containing preconfigured
	  Internet Explorer settings for Encarta?
	
	- Indeo(tm) Video, Intel Raw Video - extensions required to view Windows
	  AVI movies in Internet Explorer*
	
	- Thread Manager - extension required in System 7.1 for multitasking
	  in Internet Explorer*
	
	- Macintosh Drag and Drop - extension required in System 7.1 for drag
	  and drop support in Internet Explorer*
	
	If you don't have a copy of Internet Config version 1.3 or later on your
	hard disk, the following files are installed:
	
	- Internet Config 1.3 - folder containing the Internet Config
	  application, documentation, and Goodies folder
	
	- Internet Config Extension - extension that enables URL parsing and
	  integrated Internet preferences
	
	- Internet Preferences - file containing preconfigured Internet
	  Config settings for Encarta?
	
	* Only installed if a newer version doesn't already exist on your hard
	 drive
	
	? Never installed over an existing copy that's already on your hard
	 drive
	
	When you run Remove, the Encarta Installer will not remove extensions,
	fonts, or preferences. The Updates folder and any new files you've added
	to the Encarta 97 Encyclopedia folder will be moved to the Trash so that
	you can recover these files, if desired.
