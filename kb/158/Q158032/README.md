	DISPLAY TROUBLESHOOTING
	-----------------------
	
	High-Color Mode:
	
	GEX is optimized for high-color (16-bit) mode. If your video card is capable of
	running in high-color (16-bit) mode, change your display mode to high color.
	
	To change your display mode to high color:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the Display icon.
	
	3. Click the Settings tab.
	
	4. Under Color Palette, click High Color (16-Bit).
	
	If you're not sure that your video card supports high color, contact your video
	card manufacturer.
	
	3D Accelerated Graphics Cards:
	
	- GEX does not use enhanced features of 3D accelerated graphics cards. Many of
	  these cards require drivers that are still in a preproduction state, and you
	  may experience problems using such drivers. For updated drivers, contact your
	  hardware manufacturer.
	
	- Your video card may not be DirectX-compatible. If you're not sure that your
	  video card is DirectX-compatible, contact your video card manufacturer. Newer
	  versions of DirectX offer better video card support. The latest version of
	  DirectX is available at the following Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/directx
	
	  For more information about how to obtain the latest version of DirectX, please
	  see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	GEX Game Graphics:
	
	- If you are having trouble seeing all of the menu items on your screen, you
	  should change your Windows 95 font size to a smaller setting.
	
	  To change your Windows 95 font size:
	
	  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  2. Double-click the Display icon.
	
	  3. Click the Appearance tab.
	
	  4. On the Item list, click Menu.
	
	  5. Change the font size by clicking the Size box arrow.
	
	- If you purchased your video card before the release of Microsoft Windows 95,
	  you should install the latest video drivers. For the current video drivers,
	  contact your hardware manufacturer.
