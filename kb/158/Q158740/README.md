	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the AT command for scheduled NTBACKUP sessions in Windows NT Server
	Korean version 3.51, the Date option cannot be used because Windows NT Server
	Korean version 3.51 does not have a Korean input method editor for MS-DOS
	Command Prompt.
	
	Windows NT Server Hangul version 3.51 does not support Korean characters in the
	DOS window, the input method editor disappears on a DOS computer.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server Hangul version
	3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
