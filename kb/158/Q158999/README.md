	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If a remote solution is needed, it may be possible to use a third-party dial-up
	networking program to connect the OS/2 computer to the network with the
	Microsoft Exchange Server. Assuming Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication is
	supported over this remote connection, the Microsoft Exchange client should be
	able to connect to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server over the
	existing slow link connection. Contact IBM for information about possible remote
	solutions for the OS/2 operating system.
