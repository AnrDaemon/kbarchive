	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses how to troubleshoot GEX sound issues you may encounter if
	your system is not configured correctly.
	
	SOUND TROUBLESHOOTING
	---------------------
	
	If your GEX sound isn't working correctly, try the following troubleshooting
	steps:
	
	- Verify that your speakers and Windows 95 volume control are enabled and
	  turned up.
	
	- Verify that sounds are enabled and recognized by GEX. To verify that sounds
	  are enabled and recognized by GEX:
	
	  1. Start GEX.
	
	  2. On the Options menu, click Sound.
	
	  3. Verify that the Sound Effects, Voice, and Music check boxes are checked.
	
	  4. Verify that the volume sliders for each sound are at the maximum (the
	     top).
	
	  If the sound items in the Sound options dialog box are unavailable, you will
	  need to restart GEX to access sound effects, voice, and music.
	
	- Verify that a sound driver is enabled. To verify that a sound driver is
	  enabled:
	
	  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  2. Double-click the System icon.
	
	  3. Click the Device Manager tab.
	
	  4. Click the plus sign next to Sound, Video, And Game Controllers.
	
	  If there is a yellow exclamation mark next to the name of the device, there is
	  a conflict. If there is a device conflict, you may need to install updated
	  sound drivers. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.
	
	- If you experience choppy gameplay or sound in GEX, verify that your CD-ROM
	  drive is optimized for Windows 95, or modify the display options in GEX.
	
	  To verify that your CD-ROM drive is optimized for Windows 95:
	
	  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  2. Double-click the System icon.
	
	  3. Click the Performance tab, and then click File System.
	
	  4. Click the CD-ROM tab.
	
	  5. Drag the Supplemental Cache Size slider to Large, and then select the
	     speed of your CD-ROM drive.
	
	- To modify display options in GEX:
	
	  1. Click Options on the GEX menu, and then click Display.
	
	  2. In the Window Size box, click 320 x 224 or click Full Screen.
	
	If you purchased your sound card before the release of Microsoft Windows 95, you
	should install the latest sound drivers. For the current sound drivers, contact
	your hardware manufacturer.
