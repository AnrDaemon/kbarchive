	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Soccer, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you or your computer opponent selects a red-carded player to take a free or
	corner kick, the player does not approach the ball, and the game stops
	responding (hangs).
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent this issue from occurring, substitute a new player for the red-carded
	player as soon as possible. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Press the ESC key, and then click Coaching.
	
	2. To substitute a player on the home team, click and drag the number for a new
	  player and drop it on the number for the red-carded player.
	
	3. To substitute a player on the away team, click See Away, and then click and
	  drag the number for a new player and drop it on the number for the red-carded
	  player.
	
	4. Click Play Game.
	
	NOTE: Soccer substitutes the new player for the red-carded player the next time
	the ball is out of play (goal kicks, corner kicks, and throw-ins) and in your
	possession.
	
	STATUS
