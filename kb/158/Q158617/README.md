	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are working in a master document and you attempt to link text boxes in
	subdocuments, the insertion point is displayed as a pitcher icon or you get the
	following error message:
	
	  Word cannot link text boxes if they are in different subdocuments.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Microsoft Word allows you to link text boxes in the same document or
	subdocument. Text boxes can be added to any subdocument in a master document;
	however, a text box in one subdocument cannot be linked to a text box in a
	different subdocument.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem and exit text box linking mode (represented by a
	pitcher icon), press the ESC key.
