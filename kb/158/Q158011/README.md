## Q158011: XCLN: Unable to Download the Offline Address Book

	Article: Q158011
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0; :4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage
	Last Modified: 16-JAN-2000
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange for Windows 95, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	On the Tools menu, when you click Synchronize and click Download Address Book,
	the following error message may appear:
	
	  An error occurred while connecting to the Microsoft Exchange Server.
	
	This is followed by a second error message:
	
	  Unable to download the offline Address Book.
	
	This can occur if the profile contains only the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
	transport.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The expected behavior is that this option will be grayed out when the Microsoft
	Exchange transport is not present. Microsoft Mail for PC Networks has its own
	Download Address Book function.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients
	listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and
	will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
