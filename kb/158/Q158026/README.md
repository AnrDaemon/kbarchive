	The information in this article applies to:

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses how to play GEX with a keyboard.
	
	KEY CONTROLS
	------------
	
	To progress through the game, GEX must collect the remote control in each level
	to continue to the next level. The following describes which keys cause each
	action.
	
	Key      Action
	
	X        Jump/Enter TV
	Z        Tail whip/Remote bar
	C        Tongue lash
	V        Run
	F1       Help
	F2       Start a new game
	F3/PAUSE Pause
	F4       Toggle between full screen and window
	F5       320 x 224 window
	F6       640 x 448 window
	ESC      Exit the game
	
	IF GEX KEYBOARD CONTROLS DON'T WORK
	-----------------------------------
	
	If GEX keyboard controls don't work, make sure all connections between your
	keyboard and computer are properly secured.
	
	NOTE: Certain key configurations will not allow three simultaneous key presses,
	which often results in not being able to perform certain game actions
	simultaneously. You will hear a keyboard "tick" from the PC speaker when this
	happens.
