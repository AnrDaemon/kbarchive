	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to use Quick View to read a Microsoft Word 97 document, the
	title bar reflects the name of the document, but the Quick View window does not
	show the contents of the document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Quick View uses a text converter that cannot read Word 97 documents.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem in Quick View, on the File menu, click Open File for
	Editing. The file should now open in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. This
	problem was corrected in Microsoft Windows 98.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Quick View, which is installed by Microsoft Windows 95, allows you to view
	documents that are created by Windows-based programs without starting the
	program. If Quick View is not available on the shortcut menu, either the program
	that created your file does not support Quick View, or Quick View is not
	installed on your computer. Please see your Windows 95 documentation for
	information about how to install Quick View on your computer.
