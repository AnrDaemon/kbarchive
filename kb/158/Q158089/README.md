	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click a link (for example, Web Links or Yearbook) to the Internet from
	Encarta 97, your web browser opens, but the Encarta page does not open.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Your browser does not support GURL AppleEvent. This is used by Internet Config
	and is required to connect you to the Encarta Internet site.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Update your web browser to a version that supports GURL AppleEvent and remove
	all previous versions of your web browser. Browsers that support this
	requirement include Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 or later, or Netscape 2.0 or
	later.
	
	NOTE: Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.1 is included on the Encarta 1997
	compact disc.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Encarta 1997 uses Internet Config version 1.3 to determine what application to
	connect to a specific URL on the Internet. If the application does not
	understand the instructions Internet Config sends, the browser application may
	start, but it does not connect to the designated Web location.
