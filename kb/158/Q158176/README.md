	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following are confirmed problems with specific video cards:
	
	- Alliance Promotion: Video card driver version 4.1.3409 can cause problems
	  with MS-DOS sessions when using Windows 95 after playing GEX. To correct this
	  problem, use video driver version 4.1.21 or earlier. If you do not have
	  driver version 4.1.21 or earlier, contact your hardware manufacturer.
	
	- ATI Rage 3D: As of this writing, GEX will run on this card. However, other
	  games that use Direct3D may not run on this card because of incomplete video
	  drivers. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.
	
	- Diamond Stealth 3D 2000: If you experience bad flickering or a garbled screen
	  when running GEX in Full Screen mode, you may have an early version of the
	  video driver from Diamond. Contact Diamond Multimedia to obtain the latest
	  drivers for this card.
	
	- Diamond GT: The DirectX installation overwrites the Diamond GT video driver
	  with an incorrect driver. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated
	  drivers.
	
	- Imagine 128 Series 2: DirectX installs a faulty video driver for Imagine 128
	  Series 2 video cards. If you experience bad flickering or a garbled screen,
	  reinstall the original video driver for this card or contact #9 to obtain the
	  latest drivers.
	
	- Matrox Impression: Currently there is no DirectX support for Matrox
	  Impression cards.
	
	- Matrox Mystique: As of this writing, GEX will run on this card. However,
	  other games that use Direct3D may not run on this card because of incomplete
	  video drivers. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.
	
	- Orchid Fahrenheit: DirectX installs a faulty driver for the Orchid Fahrenheit
	  video card. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.
	
	- Rendition Verit: As of this writing, the current set of drivers for the
	  Rendition Verit chip set does not allow GEX to run in Full Screen mode. Refer
	  to your manufacturer for the latest update to the Rendition card with DirectX
	  2.0 compatibility.
	
	- S3 Virge: As of this writing, GEX will run on this card. However, other games
	  that use Direct3D may not run on this card because of incomplete video
	  drivers. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.
	
	- Weitek: Currently there are only beta drivers available for Weitek video
	  processors, which includes Diamond Viper and SDIS video cards. Contact your
	  hardware manufacturer for these drivers.
	
	NOTE: Many DirectX related problems have been resolved in the latest version of
	DirectX. Download the latest version of DirectX or, if you own a game that
	installs a newer version of DirectX, install DirectX from the newer game's
	disc.
	
	The latest version of DirectX is available at the Following Microsoft Web site:
