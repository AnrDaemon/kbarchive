	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you choose Save As to save a master document to a different directory or to
	a remote location--such as an FTP site or a server location--only the master
	document is saved to the new location and the subdocuments are saved to the
	original location.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To save the subdocuments and the master document to a new location, use the
	following steps:
	
	1. Open the master document.
	
	2. Double-click the subdocument icon.
	
	  The subdocument is opened in its own window.
	
	3. On the File menu, click Save As. Specify the new location and file name, and
	  then click OK.
	
	4. On the File menu, click Close.
	
	5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each subdocument.
	
	6. Save the master document to the new location.
