	TROUBLESHOOTING
	
	If you find that you are experiencing trouble, first check the following:
	
	Encarta Encyclopedia uses custom fonts to represent special and
	international characters. These characters usually don't correspond to
	special characters within the standard Macintosh character set and will
	appear as inappropriate or non-printing characters when copied to an
	application such as SimpleText. However, these special and international
	characters will print correctly if you print from Encarta or paste into
	applications that support Rich Text Format (RTF) such as Microsoft
	Office and Microsoft Works.
	
	If you open files on the CD or enable File Sharing, Encarta may be
	unable to eject the CD in your CD-ROM drive to swap discs. To fix this
	problem, quit all applications running from the CD (e.g. Multimedia
	Catalog, Microsoft System Information, SimpleText or the Encarta
	Installer) and close any open documents on the CD (e.g. Encarta 97 Read
	Me or QuickTime files). To disable File Sharing, open the Sharing Setup
	control panel and click the "Stop" button for File Sharing. The button
	name should change to "Start".
	
	When you copy images or articles from Encarta, they sometimes contain
	both text and pictures. Microsoft Word and Adobe PageMaker don't allow
	you to use the Paste command if the clipboard contains multiple items.
	Instead, you should use the Paste Special command, then choose whether
	you wish to paste the text or picture.
	
	The QuicKeys scrolling macros which QuicKeys installs by default do not
	work correctly within Encarta. In order for the Home, End, Page Up, or
	Page Down keys to work correctly within Encarta, these QuicKeys macros
	will have to be disabled or removed.
	
	Some versions of Now Menus will block the Command-/ keyboard shortcut
	for Encarta Guide. To obtain upgrade information, contact Now Software.
	
	Early versions of FWB CD-ROM Toolkit can cause broken audio and video,
	as well as failures to eject the CD during disc swap. To obtain upgrade
	information, contact FWB Software.

	Additional, updated troubleshooting information is available. If you
	have access to the World Wide Web, you can use the Encarta Encyclopedia
