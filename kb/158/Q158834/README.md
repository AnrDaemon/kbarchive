	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are creating a shortcut key for a program, you can assign a key
	combination that has already been used for another program.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Protection against duplication is circumvented when the default
	(CTRL+ALT+<character>) is invoked by typing only <character> when
	you are creating the shortcut.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Make sure the key combination is not in use by typing the exact key combination
	that you want to use when you are creating the shortcut.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
	as it becomes available.
