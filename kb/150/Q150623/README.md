	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Bookshelf, the startup screen looks fuzzy, blurry, or distorted.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The quality of the startup screen depends upon the color depth of your monitor.
	If your monitor is set to a low color depth, you may experience distorted
	startup screen problems.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If possible, increase the number of colors being displayed on your screen. To
	change your display settings, do the following:
	
	1. On the Apple Menu, click Control Panels.
	
	2. From the Control Panels, open the Monitors control panel.
	
	3. In the Monitors window, select either Thousands or Millions.
	
	The startup screen appearance should improve.
	
	If you are not able to increase the number of colors displayed to Thousands or
	Millions, the startup screen will continue to appear fuzzy. This will not have
	any impact on the performance of the program.
	
	STATUS
	======

	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
