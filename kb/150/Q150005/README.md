	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses the Office Integration features included with Bookshelf
	'96-'97 edition. Some features of the integration work differently than the
	features in Bookshelf 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If Office is installed on your computer, integration occurs automatically during
	the initial installation of Bookshelf.
	
	If any of the Office Integration features do not work as expected, run Bookshelf
	Setup, and remove Office Integration using the Add/Remove option. Then, run
	Bookshelf Setup again to add the Integration feature.
	
	Default Office Integration Features
	-----------------------------------
	
	The two default Office features are:
	
	- In Word, a context menu (shortcut menu, accessed by a right-click) command
	  for "Define".
	- In Bookshelf, a "Copy To Word" command on the Edit menu.
	
	The following features are different from Bookshelf 95:
	
	- Bookshelf Daily does not appear when you start Word.
	- Bookshelf or QuickShelf does not start automatically when you start Word.
	- "Bookshelf Daily" or "Define" commands do not appear on the Word view menu.
	
	Bookshelf 96 and Word 6.0
	-------------------------
	
	In Windows 3.1, Bookshelf integrates with Microsoft Word version 6.0 only.
	
	In addition to the default features, QuickShelf can be used in conjunction with
	any 16-bit Office program. Selected words are automatically found in Bookshelf
	when you click the QuickShelf Find button(s).
	
	Bookshelf 96 and Office 95 or Office 97
	---------------------------------------
	
	On systems using Windows 95 or Windows NT 3.51, Bookshelf integrates only with
	United States (USA) editions of Microsoft Office 95 or Office 97.
	
	In addition to the default features listed above, these 32-bit features are
	available:
	
	- In Bookshelf, a "Copy To PowerPoint" command on the Edit menu.
	- In Bookshelf, a "Copy To Excel" command on the Edit menu.
	- In Excel 95 only, a "Define" shortcut menu that can be enabled via the
	  Add-Ins item on the Tools menu in Excel. This is not available in Excel 97.
	- In PowerPoint 97, a "Define" shortcut menu looks up words in Bookshelf. This
	  is not available in PowerPoint 95.
	- Each Office program contains a "Lookup Reference" item on the Tools menu.
	  This feature allows you to access Microsoft Reference titles such as
	  Bookshelf.
	
	In addition, QuickShelf can be used in conjunction with any 32-bit Office
	program. Selected words are automatically found in Bookshelf when you click the
	QuickShelf Find button(s).
	
	NOTE: If the Office Shortcut Bar has been installed, QuickShelf is not installed.
	QuickShelf items can be added to the Shortcut Bar. See the Bookshelf Readme or
