	- Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you install Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 without using the Bookshelf
	Setup, the Setup Add/Remove option does not accurately report the Internet
	Explorer 2.0 installation status.
	
	For example, if you do a "Typical" Bookshelf installation, Internet Explorer is
	not installed. Later, when you click on an Internet reference in Bookshelf, you
	are asked if you want to install Internet Explorer. If you install it and later
	run Bookshelf Setup, Setup searches for "installed components" and then
	indicates Internet Explorer 2.0 is not installed.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior does not indicate a problem with Bookshelf or Internet Explorer,
	and will not cause a problem if you install Internet Explorer again from
	Bookshelf Setup.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Internet Explorer has its own Setup program. Unless Bookshelf Setup is used to
	start Internet Explorer Setup, the program does not show as an Bookshelf
	Setup-installed component.
