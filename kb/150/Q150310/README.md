	using it when a network connection loss occurs, you receive an "illegal
	operation" message with details similar to the following:
	
	  BSHELF96 caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL

	Bookshelf.

	==========
	
	Do not disconnect from the network while running Bookshelf. If network
	connection is lost, exit or shut down Windows and restart the computer.
