	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, on the Site Addressing property
	page of the Configuration container, when you try to change the Routing
	calculation server, the Apply button is not active, therefore the change cannot
	take effect.
	
	To make the Apply button active, check and uncheck the box labeled "Share address
	space with other X400 systems".
	
	NOTE: This is only applicable when multiple Microsoft Exchange Servers are in the
	same site.
