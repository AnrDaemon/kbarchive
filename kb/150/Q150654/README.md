	***Microsoft Windows 3.1***
	
	Not enough disk space
	---------------------
	Setup requires approximately 6 MB of free space on your hard
	drive to install the program. If you have less than 6 MB of free
	space, you will get this error message. You will need to free up
	space on your hard drive and reinstall the program. To find out
	how much free space you have on your hard drive, type the
	following at the MS-DOS prompt:
	
	  chkdsk
	
	The number of "bytes available on disk" should be equal to at
	least 6,291,456 bytes.
	
	Setup hangs
	-----------
	Because "The Magic School Bus Explores The Oceans" (sic) installs
	system files that maybe shared with other applications, it is
	best to shut down other applications before running Setup. Do not
	remove the Magic School Bus CD during Setup or it will fail.
	If you have closed all other open applications, and you encounter
	problems during Setup check the system requirements and make sure
	you have the minimum requirements necessary to install "The Magic
	School Bus Explores The Oceans" (sic).
