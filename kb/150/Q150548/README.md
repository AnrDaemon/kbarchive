	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create a new list in List Maker, you receive the following error
	message:
	
	  Out of memory. Please free some memory, then choose Retry.
	
	If you click Retry, the message reappears on the screen. If you click Abort or
	Ignore, the List Maker closes without saving your list.
	
	You may also receive the error when you are Saving changes to a previously
	created list.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if there is insufficient memory available to save your
	list or if virtual memory has been disabled.
	
	RESOLUTION

	1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the System icon.
	
	3. On the Performance tab, click Virtual Memory.
	
	4. Select the Let Windows Manage My Virtual Memory Settings (Recommended)
	  option. (If you must use your own virtual memory settings, allow as much
	  space as possible for the maximum size.)
	
	5. Click OK.
