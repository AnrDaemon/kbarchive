	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use the Microsoft Windows 95 and Office for Windows 95 Trial Kit, when
	you attempt to start Microsoft Bookshelf '95 by clicking the Microsoft Bookshelf
	'95 shortcut on the Start menu or the Office Shortcut Bar, or you attempt to
	start Microsoft Bookshelf '95 by clicking Lookup Reference on the Tools menu in
	Microsoft Excel or Word, the following message appears:
	
	  Please insert the Bookshelf '95 disc in the CD-ROM drive. If the drive letter
	  shown below is not the correct drive, please change it.
	
	If you change the CD-ROM drive letter in the dialog box or click OK, the message
	remains on the screen. If you click Cancel, the message disappears; however,
	Microsoft Bookshelf does not start.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the Microsoft Windows 95 and Office for Windows 95
	Trial Kit, a limited promotional package, includes a Setup option for Bookshelf
	'95, but does not include the Bookshelf '95 files.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft distributed the Office 95 Trial Kits to a limited number of
	participants in the Microsoft TechEval Seminar. Seminar participants received
	one of two kits: one kit included the Office Professional version, and the other
	kit included the Office Standard version. Although some kits included the Office
	Professional version, the Bookshelf files are missing.
