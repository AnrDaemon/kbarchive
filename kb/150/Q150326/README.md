	========
	
	The opening screen of Wine Guide is distorted. This occurs when you use version

	These are the drivers available from the Avance Logic web site at
	
	  http://www.avance.com.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Install the Windows 3.x (real mode) drivers. Many Avance Logic Video cards come
	with the Hercules Stingray PCI 3.1 drivers on floppy disk. Use this disk to load
	the Hercules Stingray PCI 3.1 drivers.
