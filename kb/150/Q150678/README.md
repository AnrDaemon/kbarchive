	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In List Maker, when you save a list of plants sorted alphabetically by Common
	Name in Plant Selector, the saved list is sorted by Botanical Name.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Complete Gardening for
	Windows, version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Saving the plant list using Common Names produces a list resorted by Botanical
	Name, but showing the Common Name. That list is added to the plant lists in the
	List Maker Option and the resulting list is not alphabetically sorted as it
	appears in the Plant Selector.
