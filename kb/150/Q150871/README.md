	The information in this article applies to:

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article provides background information about dual-channel ISDN connections
	to MSN, The Microsoft Network. With dual-channel ISDN, connection speeds up to
	128,000 bps are available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Dual-channel ISDN uses multilink PPP (MP), which is an extension to the standard
	point-to-point protocol (PPP) for using TCP/IP over a dial-up connection. MP
	allows for combining both channels of an ISDN line connection to act as a single
	large pipe for a PPP connection. MP uses two channels on an Ascend MAX, one for
	each B channel of the ISDN line.
	
	If an Ascend MAX has only one channel available, a connection is attempted to a
	channel on another MAX. When this happens, most connections fail.
