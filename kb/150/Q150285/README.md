	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Users and administrators of Microsoft Exchange Server might notice that messages
	inbound from StarNine mail will have a subject line that will not exceed 40
	characters and the body text will be wrapped at 79 characters.
	
	This is by design. This will also occur for other gateways which can handle more
	than 40 characters in the subject and 79 characters in the body.
