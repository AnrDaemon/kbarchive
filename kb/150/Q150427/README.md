	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have a window open in Bookshelf (such as the Address Builder window), and
	you start the Bookshelf Guide, you may not have access to all of the menu
	commands that the Guide prompts you to select.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When additional windows are open in Bookshelf, certain Menu items are
	unavailable (grayed-out) depending if the open window needs access to those
	items. For example, if you open a window and go to the Bookshelf Guide, not all
	the menu items will be available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, close the additional open window and proceed with the
	instructions given in the Bookshelf Guide. In the example given in the
	"Symptoms" section of this article, you need to close the Address Builder
	window.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the '96-'97 edition of Bookshelf
	for the Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
