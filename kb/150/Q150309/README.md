	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
	- Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On a computer using Windows 3.x, if Bookshelf 96-97 is installed before
	Microsoft Word 6.0, the Word Integration feature is not available.
	
	NOTE: The only Word Integration feature is a Word shortcut menu for "Define."
	This is accessed in Word by clicking on a word with your right mouse button.
	
	Reinstalling Bookshelf does not add the integration.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design in the 16-bit version of Bookshelf. The Word
	Integration"option is added in a Typical installation, whether you have Word or
	not.
	
	Reinstalling Bookshelf will not add the integration since the option has already
	been added.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	1. Run Bookshelf Setup and use the Add/Remove option to remove "Word
	  Integration."
	
	2. Run Bookshelf Setup again and use the Add/Remove option to add "Word
	  Integration." This time Setup will find Word 6.0 and correctly add the
	  integration feature.
	
	For information about how to run Setup, please see the CD-ROM jewel-case insert
	(liner notes).
