	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you install and then later remove the Multilanguage Support option, the
	multilanguage fonts continue to appear in the Fonts box in WordPad.
	
	If you select a multilanguage font [such as Times New Roman (Greek)], the Western
	version of the font [such as Times New Roman (Western)] is used. The Western
	version of the font is displayed and printed correctly.
	
	This problem also affects Microsoft Paint, but does not affect other programs.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:
	
	- Select fonts using the Fonts command on the Format menu. The correct fonts
	  are listed.
	
	- Reinstall Windows 95. Do not select the Multilanguage Support option. When
	  Setup is finished, the multilanguage fonts entries are removed.
