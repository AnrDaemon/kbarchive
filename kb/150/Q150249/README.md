	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run 3D Movie Maker Setup, one or more error messages appear if you
	eject the 3D Movie Maker compact disc while Setup is running.
	
	NOTE: Another possible cause for error messages is if the computer has difficulty
	reading the compact disc while you are running Setup.
	
	The possible error messages are:
	
	- Please Insert CD-ROM 3DMOVIE100 With Serial Number ####-#### in Drive D:. If
	  the CD-ROM is still in the drive, it may require cleaning.
	
	- Insert the CD-ROM disk labeled 'Microsoft 3D Movie Maker-3D Movie' into drive
	  D:.
	
	- Setup can proceed without copying the files on this disk. Do you want to
	  continue without these files?
	
	- Setup is not yet complete. If you quit now the product will not be installed
	  properly. Quit Setup?
	
	- One or more of the required Setup files are missing or corrupted. Setup
	  cannot continue.
	
	- 3D Movie Maker did not finish setting up on your computer. You will need to
	  run Setup again before you can run 3D Movie Maker.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To address this issue, use one or more of the following solutions.
	
	1. Do not eject the compact disc while setup for 3D Movie Maker is running.
	
	2. Clean the compact disc with a soft, dry, lint-free cloth, wiping in straight
	  lines from the center outward.
	
	After following step 1 or 2, run the 3D Movie Maker Setup.exe program again.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In most cases, when you are setting up a program to run on your computer, a set
	of files must be copied to your hard drive. If something happens during the
	transfer of files (for example, the compact disc is ejected), problems may
	occur, and you may be required to run Setup again.
