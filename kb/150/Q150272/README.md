	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Fury 3 for Windows, version 1.0 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Fury3 AVI files will not play if you have installed Fury3 under a Windows
	3.1 environment and then performed a Compact upgrade installation of Windows 95.
	This is because the compact installation of Windows 95 does not install Media
	Player and Media Player system files required to run the Fury3 AVI files.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To run the AVI files, you need to run Windows 95 Setup and install the
	multimedia files.
	
	To install the multimedia files within Windows 95, do the following:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.
	
	2. From Control Panel, click Add/Remove Programs.
	
	3. Click the Windows Setup tab.
	
	4. Make sure the Multimedia check box is selected if you want all the multimedia
	  options. If you do not want all the multimedia options, click Multimedia,
	  click Details, clear all the options other than Media Player, and then click
	  OK.
	
	5. Click the OK button to run the Setup program.
