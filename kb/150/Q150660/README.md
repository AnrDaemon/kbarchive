	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf version 1996-1997 for the Macintosh

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Bookshelf on a computer that is running a version of the Mac
	Operating System earlier than 7.0, the installation may freeze, stop Responding
	(hang), or you may receive an error message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Bookshelf 98 and Bookshelf 1996-97 do not support system software earlier than
	System 7.1.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Upgrade your system software to System 7.0 or later. System 7.1 or higher is
	recommended.
	
	NOTE: Although the minimum system requirements for Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97
	and Bookshelf 98 lists System 7.1, the programs may be installed on System 7.0.
	However, you will not have access to the Bookshelf Guide. The Bookshelf Guide
	requires at least System 7.1.
