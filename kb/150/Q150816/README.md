	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The third page in chapter 4 of the Microsoft Exchange Installation Guide
	states:
	
	  To set up a client install point:
	
	  1. Run SETUP.EXE on the Microsoft Exchange Client CD-ROM in the \CLIENTS
	  subdirectory.
	
	This should reference the \ENG subdirectory, not the \CLIENTS subdirectory.
	
	NOTE: This process is similar to just copying the appropriate subdirectory to a
	network share and letting the users run the Microsoft Exchange Client Setup from
	there.
