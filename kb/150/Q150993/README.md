	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Complete Gardening, when you print a Shopping List containing more
	than 770 lines of text, the resulting printout is truncated. Only a few lines of
	text appear on the printout.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Copy the Shopping List into a text editor such as Microsoft WordPad and print
	the list directly from the text editor. For more information about how to
	accomplish this, see your word processor printed documentation or online Help.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you shorten the Shopping List to 770 lines of text or less, you can print the
	list normally from Complete Gardening.
