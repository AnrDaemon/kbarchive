	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you work with Microsoft Bookshelf, temporary files appear in your
	Bookshelf 1996-97 folder on the hard drive. These files are named "Do" and "oc,"
	and may begin with a symbol character.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you use the Find function in Bookshelf, the program creates temporary files
	that it uses as part of the Find process. It is normal to have these files.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	After you quit Microsoft Bookshelf, the temporary files should be deleted
	automatically.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the files are not deleted automatically, it should not pose a problem.
	However, if you wish to remove them manually, do the following:
	
	1. On the Special menu, click Restart.
	
	2. After the machine restarts, you may drag the temporary files to the Trash and
	  then empty the Trash. This deletes the files.
