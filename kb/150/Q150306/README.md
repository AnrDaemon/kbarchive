	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you install Bookshelf using the Minimal installation option, Bookshelf runs
	from the compact disc, resulting in slower performance than the Typical
	installation. This is normal behavior. So to increase performance, you then run
	Bookshelf Setup again. The Add/Remove includes the following text:
	
	  Microsoft Bookshelf application files: Selecting this option will install the
	  application and the necessary system files, otherwise only the necessary
	  system files will be installed on the hard drive, and the application will
	  run from CD.
	
	However, after you install the files to the hard drive, Bookshelf continues to
	run from compact disc and performance is not increased.
	
	NOTE: These Setup options are only available if you start the Bookshelf Setup
	from the CD-ROM drive root folder. They are not available if you use the AutoRun
	feature.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf '96-'97 for
	Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, do the following:
	
	1. Run Bookshelf Setup.
	
	2. Choose the Remove All option.
	
	3. Run Bookshelf Setup again, and perform a Typical Installation.
	
	  NOTE: You can choose a Custom installation if you select the Bookshelf Files
	  option.
	
	After you remove and reinstall the program, Bookshelf will run from the hard
	drive.
