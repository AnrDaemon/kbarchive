	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the keyboard to change system settings by running Windows Setup and
	choosing Change System Settings from the Options menu, you can scroll to the
	left (up) or to the right (down) by using the arrow keys to view selections.
	
	If you scroll all the way to the right, a dialog box will appear requesting the
	insertion of a display, keyboard, mouse, or network driver disk provided by the
	hardware manufacturer. Although this does not create a problem, it can be an
	unexpected inconvenience when scrolling through these selections.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Press the ESC key or Cancel button to close this dialog box without modifying
	the current selection. If you are using a mouse, this dialog box will not appear
	until the selection for "Other xxxxxxx (Requires disk from OEM)..." is entered
	(where xxxxxxx is display, keyboard, mouse, or network drivers).
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
