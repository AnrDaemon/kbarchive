	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, some Windows-based
	applications will not update an OLE object when Paintbrush sends an update
	command using the File menu's Update command. This may also happen with other
	OLE servers.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Windows-based applications that were produced before Windows 3.1 may not be able
	to process the OLE_CHANGE command that is sent out when the Update command is
	chosen.
