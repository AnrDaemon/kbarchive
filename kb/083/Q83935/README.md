	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Program information files (PIFs) created for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 are
	100 percent compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.
	It is not necessary to update or modify existing Windows 3.0 PIF files after
	upgrading to Windows 3.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Setup Applications command in Windows Setup automatically creates PIF files
	for selected applications if no corresponding PIF file already exists. Forcing
	Setup to create a PIF file (for example, by deleting an existing PIF file) is
	not recommended because the existing PIF file is already valid and may contain
	information that the new PIF file will not contain.
