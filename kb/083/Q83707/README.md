	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Productivity Pack version 1.0 was designed specifically for
	Microsoft Windows version 3.0. To run the Productivity Pack with the Microsoft
	Windows operating system version 3.1, you need to obtain the updated version
	designed for Windows 3.1; otherwise, you may experience compatibility problems.
	In addition, much of the information in Learning Windows is irrelevant in
	Windows 3.1 because of the extensive changes in this version of Windows.
	
	For information about obtaining the updated Microsoft Productivity Pack, contact
	your software vendor or call Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at (800)
	426-9400. If you are outside the United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary
	for your area.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You may experience the following problems if you run Productivity Pack version
	1.0 in Windows 3.1:
	
	- Interactive sessions may generate a message that implies you did not follow
	  the steps correctly, even if you follow the steps exactly. The box that
	  contains this message overlaps the OK button; therefore, the only available
	  option is to exit that section by pressing CTRL+F1.
	
	- When you run lesson 2, "Getting Help," from the Learning Windows portion of
	  Productivity Pack 1.0, the program starts, proceeds through the demonstration
	  of the help system, and generates the following error message:
	
	  Help topic does not exist!
	
	  If you attempt to recover from this message by choosing the OK button and
	  pressing the SPACEBAR to continue, the system hangs.
