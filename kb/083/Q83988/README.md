	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The ENTER key on the numeric keypad cannot be used to toggle MS-DOS-based
	applications between running in full-screen and window modes in Microsoft
	Windows operating system version 3.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To toggle an application from full-screen and window modes, hold down the ALT
	key and press the keyboard's standard ENTER key (ALT+ENTER). This is only
	possible when running Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
	
	Windows 3.1 does not recognize the scan code of the extended ENTER key on the
	numeric keypad as valid for the ALT+ENTER key combination.
