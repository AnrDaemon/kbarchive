	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you run the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 in standard mode
	with Quarterdeck's QEMM386, only 8 MB of memory is available to Windows, even if
	more physical RAM is available. If you choose About Program Manager from the
	Help menu in Program Manager, you are unlikely see more than 6,900K available
	memory.
	
	This problem only occurs if you are using QEMM386. It does not occur with other
	upper memory block (UMB) providers such as EMM386.EXE and 386MAX.
	
	The only workaround currently available is to run Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
	For more information, contact Quarterdeck.
