	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you install an Identity Module in the PROM port of an Epson LQ-1000 printer,
	you cannot print using the LQ-1000 printer driver supplied with Microsoft
	Windows. Instead, you are limited to text-only printing using the Generic Text
	printer driver.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	An Identity Module is a small plug-in cartridge available from Epson for
	installation on their LQ-1000 model printers. It is designed to emulate the
	Diablo 630 printer, as well as the IBM 5152. Therefore, it limits the LQ-1000
	capabilities to text-only printing. This results in a loss of graphics printing
	capabilities and is most noticeable when attempting to print from Microsoft
	Windows Paintbrush.
	
	The Identity Module is installed inside the right rear area of the printer
	through an access door. You can remove this cartridge at any time; however, it
	should be done while the printer is off.
	
	After removing the cartridge and restoring power to the printer, you can use the
	LQ-1000 printer driver supplied with the retail package of Windows.

	or reliability.
