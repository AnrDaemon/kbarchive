	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	While running Microsoft Windows in real mode from the OS/2 version 1.x
	MS-DOS compatibility box, Windows File Manager disk commands (Format
	Disk, Copy Disk, Label Disk, and Make System Disk) are not available.
	This limitation is by design and necessary because of the architecture
	of the OS/2 MS-DOS compatibility box.
	
	To work around this problem, you must use the OS/2 File Manager to
	access these functions.
