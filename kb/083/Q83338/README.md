	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Downloading TrueType fonts as PCL fonts to Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers
	developed prior to the LaserJet Series II printers is not supported in Microsoft
	Windows version 3.1. Such printers include the original HP LaserJet, the HP
	LaserJet Plus, and the HP LaserJet 500+. On these printers, True Type fonts are
	printed as raster graphics.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The HP LaserJet Series II printers and subsequent HP printers, including the HP
	LaserJet III family, can either download TrueType fonts or print them as raster
	graphics. This ability is controlled by the Print TrueType As Graphics check box
	in the printer driver's Options dialog box. Downloading TrueType fonts is the
	default selection. This results in the quickest printing times because less data
	must be sent to the printer.
	
	The HP products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
	performance or reliability.
