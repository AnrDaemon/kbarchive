	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the Microsoft Productivity Pack for Windows operating system version 3.1, you
	can task switch out of the application. In earlier versions, task switching is
	disabled, and it is necessary to first exit the program before being allowed to
	access the Program Manager. To task switch out of the Productivity Pack, press
	CTRL+ESC. This will minimize the Productivity Pack to an icon and bring up the
	Task List. When ready to return to the tutorial, choose the application icon.
	
	Note that CTRL+ESC does not work in all areas of the tutorial. In areas where
	task switching is being explained or a demonstration is taking place, task
	switching is disabled. You must go back to the topic menu before being allowed
	to use CTRL+ESC.
