	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You may encounter minor distortions when using Microsoft Windows operating
	system version 3.1 TrueType fonts at certain point sizes; for example, when
	Courier New Bold is used in 19 or 20 point, the horizontal bar of the "e" is
	only one pixel thick, but at smaller point sizes, the bar is thicker.
	
	Informal testing has shown that is a video display problem only and will not
	affect printing.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 3.1. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.
