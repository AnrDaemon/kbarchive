## Q83781: Beethoven Arrows Invisible Under Windows 3.1

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Beethoven version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When you run Microsoft Multimedia Beethoven under Microsoft Windows
	operating system version 3.1, the arrows that are in the Close Reading
	section will be invisible. You may also see intermittent font display
	problems in various locations, and buttons overlapping fonts.
	
	This occurs because portions of Multimedia Beethoven's fonts were
	formatted in ToolBook for 13-point Tms Rmn. Under Microsoft Windows
	3.0 with Multimedia Extensions 1.0, Windows scaled the screen font to
	a Tms Rmn 12-point screen font. With Windows 3.1 and TrueType, you
	actually have a 13-point Times New Roman TrueType screen font, which
	overflows the text field.
	
	This problem has been corrected in version 1.0a.
