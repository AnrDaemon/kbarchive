	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some Intel machines require a BIOS update if the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination
	causes the CMOS settings to be erased when EMM386.EXE is loaded. This problem
	only occurs with HIMEM.SYS version 3.07 and EMM386.EXE version 4.44, which
	shipped with the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.
	
	According to Intel, this is a known BIOS problem and can be fixed with a BIOS
	update.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To obtain an updated BIOS, call (800) 468-3548 (INTEL4U). You can also obtain
	the update from Intel's bulletin board at (503) 693-1493. Log on as "guest" (the
	password). The file is 11031O0.ZIP.
	
	The BIOS must be within the range "Phoenix 85-91 1.10.30.O0" to "Phoenix 85-91
	1.10.31.O0" Note: The second to the last character in these numbers is the
	letter O, not 0 (zero).
