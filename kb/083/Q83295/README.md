	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When transferring formatted text from Windows 3.1 Write to Paintbrush, the text
	will not retain its formatting (that is, italic, bold, and so on). Rather, it
	will take on the currently selected text attributes in Paintbrush (in the Text,
	Fonts menu). Paintbrush does not support superscript or subscript.
	
	When pasting text in Paintbrush, the text tool must be chosen, and the cursor
	placed on the screen; an attempt to paste when a different tool is selected
	results in the following error message:
	
	  Only Text is available on the Clipboard. To paste text, first select the
	  position for pasting text, and then use the Paste command.
	
	Text cannot be pasted into Paintbrush in Windows 3.0; the paste command is
	unavailable (dimmed).
