	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Video Seven proprietary resolution modes are not supported in virtual machines
	under Windows version 3.0.
	
	A virtual display device (VDD) specifically for the Video Seven cards is required
	to provide this functionality. Such a device is not shipped with Windows 3.0,
	although a Video Seven specific 640 x 480, 256-color display driver (V7VGA.DRV)
	is supplied.
	
	Instead, Video Seven "pure VGA mode" support is built into the Windows 3.0 VDDVGA
	(standard VGA VDD) device.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	According to Video Seven technical support, updated Windows 3.0 display drivers
	and a Video Seven specific VDD are now available. Please contact Video Seven for
	availability information.
	
	Also, updated Windows 3.0 display drivers for the Video Seven V-RAM, 1024i, and
	FastWrite video cards can be obtained from the MISCELLANEOUS section of the
