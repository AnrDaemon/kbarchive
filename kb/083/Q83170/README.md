	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The 3.5-inch disk version of Windows 3.1 is packaged in two separate
	bags. The first bag contains Disks 1 through 5; the second bag
	contains Disk 6.
	
	Microsoft packaged the disks in this manner purposely. Although the
	packages can hold six disks, too much stress would be placed on the
	packages. This information does not apply to the 5.25-inch disk
	version of Windows 3.1.
