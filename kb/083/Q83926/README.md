	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The licensing policy for the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 is
	different from the licensing policy for Windows 3.0. The Windows 3.1 licensing
	agreement allows for only one installation per license.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Under the licensing agreements for Microsoft applications software and Windows
	3.0, if the software is permanently installed on the hard disk or other storage
	device of a computer (other than a network server) and one person uses that
	computer more than 80 percent of the time it is in use, then that person may
	also use the software on a portable or home computer.
	
	However, Windows 3.1 is considered systems software and therefore follows the
	same licensing agreement as MS-DOS (that is, you must purchase one copy of the
	software for each machine).
	
	The following is a copy from Grant of License section of Windows 3.1 license
	card:
	
	  Grant of License. Microsoft grants to you the right to use one copy of the
	  enclosed Microsoft software program (the "SOFTWARE") on a single computer.
	  The SOFTWARE is in "use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary
	  memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g., hard disk,
	  CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer. However, installation on a
	  network server for the sole purpose of distribution to one or more other
	  computer(s) shall not constitute "use" for which a separate license is
	  required.
	
	All Microsoft license agreements are version-specific, meaning that they apply
	only to the version of the product that you acquired with the license. If you
	upgrade from Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1, you only have one license for Windows.
	The Windows 3.1 license replaces the Windows 3.0 license.
