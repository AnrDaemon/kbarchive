	One of the screens that displays during Windows 3.1 Setup includes the
	following statement:
	
	  SETUP HELP
	  For information about automated setup for user workstations, see the
	  SYSADMIN.WRI file
	
	This is an error in the Setup help screen. The SYSADMIN.WRI file does
	not exist. This file was incorporated into the Windows Resource Kit
	(WRK). Information about automated setup is in Chapter 1 of the WRK,
	"Windows 3.1 Installation, Using Automated Setup: Setup /h."
	
	NOTE: You may also find references to the System Administrator's Guide
	in Windows 3.1 documentation. This guide was also incorporated into
	the WRK.
