	When using Microsoft Visual Basic 1.0 in Microsoft Windows operating system
	3.1, a vertical scroll bar will become misaligned if the bar is resized.
	The alignment problem between flashing scroll thumb and the "actual" scroll
	thumb occurs because the two actually become separate objects when the
	vertical scroll bar is resized.
