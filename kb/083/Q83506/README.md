	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the Microsoft Productivity Pack for Windows operating system version 3.1 you
	have the ability to minimize the application to an icon at the bottom of the
	screen. The minimized icon does not react like other icons in the Windows
	environment, and cannot be moved. You can, however, restore the icon by choosing
	the Restore command from the Control menu, or by double-clicking the icon.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The reason the icon cannot be moved like other icons in the Windows environment
	is because while running the Productivity Pack you are in a simulated Windows
	environment. The functionality to minimize the icon is also simulated, and
	therefore does not operate like other icons in all respects.
