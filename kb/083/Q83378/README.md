	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The IdleWild screen saver included in the Windows Entertainment Pack versions
	1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, does not hide applications that use the Always On Top command
	if this option is active. The chosen screen saving display appears, but the
	application continues to display over the screen saver.
	
	This problem occurs with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
	applications.
