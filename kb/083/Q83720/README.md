	Installing Windows 3.1 on a AT&T Safari
	---------------------------------------
	
	Windows 3.1 cannot be installed in a new directory on an AT&T Safari notebook
	computer. Windows must be upgraded by installing Windows 3.1 over Windows 3.0.
	If you attempt to install Windows in a new subdirectory or have renamed the
	WIN.COM file, you receive the following error message:
	
	  Windows cannot be installed on this type of computer. You can only upgrade
	  from version 3.0
	
	  Quit Setup, contact your hardware manufacturer for a copy of Windows 3.0 and
	  install it on your system. Then run Setup for Windows 3.1 to update.
	
	AT&T has a version of Windows 3.0 that was modified specifically for the
	Safari notebook computers. The devices included with this version of Windows are
	also required to run Windows 3.1.
	
	Problems Running MS-DOS Prompt
	------------------------------
	
	According to AT&T technical support, when you run an MS-DOS prompt from
	Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, the computer may hang when you attempt to
	access a floppy drive. This problem may also occur in MS-DOS when you are not
	running Windows.
	
	The problem can be corrected with a BIOS upgrade. You can identify the problem
	BIOS by the "Diagnostics Reference ID ##" line that is displayed at the top of
	the screen when you first start up your machine. The problem BIOS is number 12.
	
	To upgrade the BIOS, you must send your machine to AT&T to have the chip set
	replaced. At this time, the most recent version of the BIOS is 16. For more
	information, please contact AT&T.
	
	Safari notebook computers are manufactured by AT&T, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
