	When you attempt to use the Go To Page command in the File menu of
	Write, Write does not seem to go the right page number, but stays the
	same. The Go To Page command in Write may require repagination before
	Write can recognize different page numbers.
	
	When a file is retrieved, for example README.WRI, Write may not apply
	the repagination automatically.
	
	To repaginate:
	
	1. From the File menu in Write, choose Repaginate. Write displays the Repaginate
	  Document dialog box.
	
	2. Choose OK. Write displays "Repaginating Document" in a dialog box.
	
	After repaginating, Write should show a correct page number when you
	use the Go To Page command or when you page up or down.
