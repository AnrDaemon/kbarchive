	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use a bold vector font, such as Modern, Roman, or Script, in Microsoft
	Windows Write, the text and the cursor positions will not match. Two display
	problems occur:
	
	1. As the characters are displayed, they jump to the left away from the cursor.
	
	2. As the line length increases, the further apart the character and cursor
	  positions appear on the display.
	
	This problem is caused by the limited functionality of vector fonts and the
	ability to simulate bold characters with them in a WYSIWYG environment such as
	Windows.
	
	To correct this problem select a TrueType font in Windows 3.1.
