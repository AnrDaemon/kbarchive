## Q269819: Deadlock Deleting Attribute Stream During File Creation

	Article: Q269819
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows NT 4.0 may stop responding (hang) or deadlock randomly during heavy file
	input/output (I/O) operations on a partition that uses the NTFS file system.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is caused by an untimely attempt to remove the attribute list
	stream for an NTFS file while other streams still exist for the file control
	block (FCB).
	
	When Windows NT 4.0 hangs, there are two threads involved. One thread is in the
	process of opening the attribute stream and waiting for the FCB lock. The other
	thread has the FCB lock and is closing the stream, but cannot close it until the
	reference count is zero.
