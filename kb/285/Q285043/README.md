	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you assign a keyboard key, or game controller button to the "Select
	gunsight" action in the Assignments list, the assigned key or button does not
	change the gunsight.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue occurs because Combat Flight Simulator 2 does not have an alternate
	gunsight.
	
	You may only use the default "reflector" gunsight, and not the "gyro" gunsight.
