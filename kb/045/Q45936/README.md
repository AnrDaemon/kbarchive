	When you copy Microsoft Excel spreadsheet data and paste it into
	Microsoft Windows Write, the data in Write is not aligned as it is in
	Excel; the rows of data do not line up under the column  headings.
	
	When you import data through the Clipboard to Write, that data comes
	in as text separated by tab characters. You need to reset the tab
	stops in Write to have that data display and print correctly.
