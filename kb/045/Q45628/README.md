## Q45628: Mac Wkst: Graphic Images Not Saved as a File

	Article: Q45628
	Product(s): Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After you save a graphic message from Microsoft Mail using the Save As button in
	the Read Image window, the graphic does not appear in the resulting document
	when it is opened in a word processor.
	
	The graphic does not appear because Microsoft Mail saves files in text format;
	that is, only alphanumeric characters are saved. Because a graphic is not a text
	character, it is lost when the mail message is saved. This is true for the
	default Mail Image form or for any other customized form that contains graphic
	objects.
	
	To save a graphic, copy it into the Clipboard, then paste the Clipboard contents
	into the Scrapbook or into an application that accepts the graphic. Microsoft
	Word, Microsoft Works, Microsoft File, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Write
	will accept a graphic from the Clipboard.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Mail messages are saved in text format because this format can be read by a
	large number of word-processing programs. This feature makes Mail compatible
	with a large software base.
