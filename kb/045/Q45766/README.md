	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Bcc option in Microsoft Mail enables users to send a blind carbon copy of a
	mail message to other users. This means Bcc recipients receive an exact copy of
	the mail message, but the To and Cc recipients of the mail message cannot tell
	who the Bcc recipients are. The Bcc option can be used to send a mail message
	when it isn't important that recipients know who else receives a copy of the
	mail message.
	
	To use the Bcc option, do the following:
	
	1. In the Address Mail window, select Bcc under the Add As label.
	
	2. Select the names of users to receive a blind carbon copy of the mail message.
	
	Users who are selected as Bcc have a "Bcc" prefix in front of their names in the
	Message Recipients list box. Please note that when the message is read, there is
	no Bcc line identifying users who received a blind carbon copy of the message.
	
	Please note that all users who receive a mail message, whether they are on the To
	line, the Cc line, or are Bcc recipients, receive the same mail message.
