	The bit-mapped font files (HELVB.FON, TMSRB.FON, COURB.FON) contain
	various scales of their fonts. It is currently not possible to remove
	one particular font size from the file to create a single-size font
	file. To work around this, you must create your own font
	file via the use of the Windows font editor.
