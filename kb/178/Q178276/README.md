	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Cluster Server 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When accessing the dependencies tab by using the Modify button on the properties
	page of a particular resource, the properties button on that page will be
	unavailable.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This initial be unavailable display may be misleading when first accessing the
	page. First, it is necessary to select a particular resource on that page for
	the properties button to become available. As soon as the property on the left
	side of the page is selected, you can add or remove any dependencies.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server, Enterprise
	Edition version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
