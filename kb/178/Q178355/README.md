	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article details using a text box to make Microsoft Word 97 simulate a
	vertical text flip for a tent page.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 does not have an option to flip text vertically. To create a
	page that can be folded "tent style" and have readable text on both sides of the
	fold, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the File menu, Click Page Setup.
	
	2. Click Paper Size tab, and click to select Landscape Orientation.
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	4. On the Drawing toolbar, click the Text Box tool.
	
	5. Draw a text box representing one side of the tent (right or left).
	
	6. Enter the desired text into the text box.
	
	7. Click the Change Text Direction button on the Text Box toolbar until the text
	  is in the desired orientation.
	
	8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 to create the text for the second side of the tent.
	
	  NOTE: The text on this side should end up "flipped" in relation to the text in
	  the first Text Box.
	
	An alternate method that can be used to rotate text is to use the Word Art button
	on the Drawing toolbar.
	
	For more information about this method, type "how do I edit a special text
	effect" in the Office Assistant.
	
	For more information about rotating text, click the Office Assistant, type "how
	do I edit a special text effect," click Search, and then click to view "Add or
	edit a special text effect."
	
	NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
	Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
