	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use the Measurement Equivalents InterActivity "How many millimeters in a
	mile?" in Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Windows, when you type a number
	in the Miles box, the equivalent measurement in the Feet box is incorrect.
	
	For example, when you type "1" in the Miles box, "5,820" is displayed in the Feet
	box. There are actually 5,280 feet in a mile.
	
	NOTE: When you type a number in the Feet box, the equivalent measurement in the
	Miles box is correct.
	
	STATUS
	======

	Encyclopedia for Windows. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
