	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you rename a file on an NTFS or FAT partition, the archive bit is not set
	to indicate the file has changed. As a result, utilities that rely on the
	archive bit, such as backup utilities, do not correctly handle a renamed file.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the file system drivers do not set the archive bit
	when a file is renamed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
