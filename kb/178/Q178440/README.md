	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Readme1st.txt file in the \Workshop folder indicates that the Smartest.exe
	file can be run at any time to take and score the practice tests included with
	this CD-ROM.
	
	However, when you run the program, you may receive one of two errors:
	
	  No practice questions appear in the program.
	
	  -or-
	
	  Application Error
	  Exception EOleSysError in module SMARTEST.EXE AT 0002EE4A. Class not
	  registered.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	There are no practice questions included with the Systems Management Server
	kit.
	
	The second error is caused by an incompatibility between this program and
	Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft Press has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Systems
	Management Server Training." We will post further information here in the
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
