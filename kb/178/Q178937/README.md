	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you type information by using the data form of your mail-merge data source,
	some field information may be lost.
	
	NOTE: This problem has been reported to occur when there are nine or more data
	fields in the data form.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if you use the UP ARROW key or DOWN ARROW key to move
	between fields in the data form.
	
	NOTE: This problem does not occur in earlier versions of Word because the UP
	ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys move the insertion point to the left or right,
	respectively, within the field rather than moving it to a different field in the
	data form.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use the TAB or ENTER key to move from one field to the next, or use the mouse to
	click between fields.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can display data records in the Data Form dialog box in one of the following
	ways.
	
	From the Mail Merge Helper Dialog Box
	-------------------------------------
	
	If you are working in the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, click Edit (next to Get
	Data), and then click the data source you want.
	
	From a Mail-Merge Main Document
	-------------------------------
	
	If you are working in a mail-merge main document, click Edit Data Source on the
	Mail Merge toolbar.
	
	From a Word Data Source Displayed in the Document Window
	--------------------------------------------------------

	Database toolbar.
