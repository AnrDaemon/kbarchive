	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, you do not need to download an updated list
	of Internet links. Bookshelf accesses a common database administered by
	Microsoft which keeps these links up-to-date.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Bookshelf includes a new feature called Web Link Redirection. This
	feature automatically checks the Internet Directory address you are attempting
	to access and notifies you of any discontinuations, equipment failures, or
	address changes. In this way, Bookshelf is able to keep up up with the changes
	as the addresses of Web sites change.
	
	This feature is invisible to you unless a link has actually changed, in which
	case your browser displays a Web page that states the nature of the change and
	provides you with a link to the new address, if there is one.
	
	If the page you are attempting to access no longer exists, Web Link Redirection
	notifies you of the status of the page.
	
	NOTE: Not all types of Internet resources can be updated using Web Link
	Redirection. See the chart in the Using The Internet Directory Help topic for a
	complete list of the Internet resources that Web Link Redirection is able to
	update.
