	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows, you may be alerted that the
	10_Past_3.748 virus was found in the Unwise.exe file. This alert is incorrect.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Norton AntiVirus utility monitors your system for certain activities that
	may indicate the presence of a virus. The Unwise.exe program performs one or
	more of the activities for which Norton AntiVirus is monitoring.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, temporarily disable Norton AntiVirus and then install
	Bookshelf 98.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Unwise.exe file does not contain a virus. Although Norton AntiVirus
	indicates that the file is performing "virus-like" activities, previous versions
	of Norton AntiVirus do not indicate this behavior, nor do other virus detection
	utilities.
