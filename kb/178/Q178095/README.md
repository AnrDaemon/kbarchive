	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you configure a newsfeed on a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 computer,
	importing an active text file may cause an Access Violation. An active text file
	is a list of the newsgroups available from the newsfeed provider for inbound
	newsfeeds. Selecting a large number of folders to be imported from the Active
	text file in the Newsfeed Configuration Wizard will cause this access violation
	to occur.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
	Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
	Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
