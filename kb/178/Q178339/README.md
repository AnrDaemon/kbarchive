	Flight Controls
	---------------
	
	When you use keyboard controls, make sure the NumLock feature on your keyboard is
	turned off, and use the numeric keypad to type the numbers.
	
	Helicopters use a different set of flight controls than airplanes. The following
	list briefly explains each control:
	
	- Collective - Increases or decreases the lift for the main rotor, and adjusts
	  the throttle automatically.
	
	- Power - Adjusts the throttle independantly from the collective.
	
	- Cyclic - Similar to a combined aileron, elevator, and speed control in an
	  airplane.
	
	  NOTE: The degree to which you move the cyclic determines how fast the
	  helicopter moves in a particular direction.
	
	- Anti-torque pedals - Function similarly to the rudder control in an airplane.
	
	The following table lists the actions you can perform with each of the helicopter
	flight controls, and the keyboard and joystick controls to use to perform these
	actions:

	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	  | Collective         | Decrease lift            | F2        | Throttle down | 
	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	  | Power              | Increase throttle        | CTRL+F3   | n/a           | 
	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	  | Power              | Decrease throttle        | CTRL+F2   | n/a           |

	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	  | Cyclic             | Bank/move right          | Num 6     | Light         | 
	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	  | Cyclic             | Bank/move left           | Num 4     | Left          | 
	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	  | Anti-torque pedals | Pivot right              | Num ENTER | Rudder right  | 
	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	  | Anti-torque pedals | No pivot                 | Num 5     | Rudder center | 
	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	  | Anti-torque pedals | Pivot left               | Num 0     | Rudder left   | 
	  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	
	* Increases air speed.
	
	** Decreases air speed.
	
	Helicopter Flight Guidelines
	----------------------------
	
	This information may help you with basic flight operations when you are flying
	the Bell 206B JetRanger III helicopter.
	
	- Use smooth, small control pressures, not abrupt or large control movements.
	
	- Anticipate how moving one control requires corresponding movements of the
	  other controls. For example, if you add power by increasing collective, you
	  must also add left anti-torque pedal to compensate for the helicopter's
	  tendency to rotate to the right. If you wait to see the effect and then
	  react, you may have trouble controlling the aircraft.
	
	- Never remove your hand from the cyclic while the main rotor is turning.
	
	- After you land, make sure the helicopter has firmly settled and that the
	  collective is in the full down position as you prepare to shut down the
	  engine. Hold the cyclic in the neutral position until the main rotor stops.
