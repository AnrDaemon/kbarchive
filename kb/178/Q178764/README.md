	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail, a user can automatically add recipients to their Personal
	Address Book (PAB). However, the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook
	clients do not have this functionality.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are several third-party products (such as ExLife or CaBook) that add this
	capability to Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook clients.
	
	For more information about third-party add-ons that may provide the ability to
	add recipients to the PAB, refer to the following World Wide Web site:
