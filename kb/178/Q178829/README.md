	================
	
	Location of the VOR2 Needle
	---------------------------
	
	In the LearJet, at the bottom of the panel containing the Horizontal Situation
	Indicator (HSI), you see several knobs and switches. When you move the pointer
	over the leftmost switch, the pointer changes to a hand, and the label Toggle
	VOR2 Needle appears below the pointer. Click once to display the VOR2 needle
	inside the HSI.
	
	In the 737-400, the VOR2 needle is displayed in the Radio Magnetic Indicator
	(Dual Needle RMI) which is just to the left of the HSI.
	
	OBS Course
	----------
	
	The OBS course for VOR2 in both the LearJet and the 737 have no impact on the
	display of the VOR2 needle. In addition, the OBS course cannot be adjusted in
	the 737; it retains the current settings when you select the airplane. If you
	change the OBS course setting before you select the 737, the VOR2 needle in the
	Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI) remains unchanged, even though the OBS course
	setting is different.
