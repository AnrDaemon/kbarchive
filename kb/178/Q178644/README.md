	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	DirectX is an extension for the Microsoft Windows operating system that provides
	a set of fast, low-level hardware controls that programmers can use to increase
	performance for Windows games and multimedia programs. Because the current
	generation of Windows games and multimedia programs requires DirectX to function
	properly, DirectX is not designed to be removed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	DirectX includes updated drivers for many popular sound cards and video
	adapters. If you have an older version of the driver for one of these sound
	cards or video adapters installed in your computer, DirectX installs a newer
	version of the driver that is DirectX-enabled. If DirectX installs an updated
	driver, you can use the DirectX Setup tool to restore the previous driver. When
	you restore your previous drivers, you do not remove DirectX.
	
	NOTE: Do not restore the previous sound and video drivers unless the updated
	DirectX drivers are incompatible with your hardware.
	
	Windows 98 includes DirectX version 5.2. This version of DirectX does not include
	the option to restore the previous drivers, because all of the drivers included
	in Windows 98 are DirectX-enabled drivers. To change your drivers, run the
	Update Device Driver wizard.
	
	If you cannot start Windows after you install DirectX, restore your previous
	sound and video drivers.
