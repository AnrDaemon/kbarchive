	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the differences in functionality between the Auto-rudder
	feature in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, the Auto-coordination feature in
	Microsoft Flight Simulator 98, and the Auto-coordination feature in Microsoft
	Flight Simulator for Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you enable the Auto-rudder or Auto-coordination feature in Flight Simulator
	98/2000, the feature automatically attempts to stabilize the plane when you
	bank. Auto-rudder or Auto-Coordination adjusts the rudder only slightly, giving
	you more flight stability at the cost of maneuverability.
	
	When you enable the Auto-coordination feature in Flight Simulator for Windows 95,
	the rudder moves with the ailerons. This gives you greater maneuverability at
	the cost of flight stability.
	
	To enable or disable the Auto-rudder feature in Flight Simulator 2000:
	
	1. On the Aircraft menu, click Realism Settings.
	
	2. Under "Flight controls", click to clear or select the Auto-rudder check box,
	  and then click the CHECK MARK button.
	
	To enable or disable the Auto-coordination feature in Flight Simulator 98 or
	Flight Simulator 95:
	
	1. On the Aircraft menu, click Aircraft Settings.
	
	2. On the Realism tab, click to clear or select the Auto-coordination check box,
	  and then click OK.
