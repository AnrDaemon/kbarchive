	========
	
	If you are using the Norton Antivirus program for Windows 95 and have the
	AutoProtect mode enabled, the Exchange client hangs when you try to log on.
	
	Although the system acts as if it is trying to connect to the Exchange Server
	computer by displaying the Exchange client log-on logo, the system will hang
	indefinitely at this point.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Disabling the AutoProtect option of the Norton Antivirus program will allow you
	to connect to the Exchange Server computer.
