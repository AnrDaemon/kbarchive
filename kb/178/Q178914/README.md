	When you try to connect to a printer, you may receive the following message:
	
	  Name is invalid
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Although wildcard characters such as asterisk (*), percent (%), and question
	mark (?) are valid characters in the NetWare Directory Services (NDS) path, they
	are invalid when connecting to printers through Client Services for NetWare
	(CSNW).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Windows NT version 4.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
