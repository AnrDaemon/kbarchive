	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a message composed in Wordmail that contains text altered by
	subscripting or by character positioning of a group of characters where the
	point positioning is greater than the point size of the text, the text becomes
	invisible in an Exchange client and/or Wordpad.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by the differences in the RTF specifications between
	Word97 and Outlook and WordPad and Exchange.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, do not format the text in this way, or use the
	Outlook client as the primary messaging client.
