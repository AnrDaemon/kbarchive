	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select multiple messages to print and choose the "Print attached files
	with items" option in the Print dialog box, the attachments are printed after
	all the messages are printed, instead of being printed after each message to
	which the attachment belongs.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Messages and attachments are printed by separate applications in separate print
	jobs; therefore, the attachments are printed after the messages by their
	associated applications.
