	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The appearance of the ambiguity indicator on the Cessna aircraft instrument
	panel in Flight Simulator 98/2000 is different from the Cessna ambiguity
	indicator in earlier versions of Flight Simulator.
	
	The ambiguity indicator displays your position relative to the station and the
	radial that you have selected with the omni-bearing selector (OBS). The
	ambiguity indicator also indicates whether you are receiving a usable navigation
	signal.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you receive a usable navigation signal, the ambiguity indicator (the
	triangle located beside the small letters "NAV" near the bottom of the VOR 1
	Indicator gauge) points up or down. The up position indicates that the OBS is
	set to a radial leading toward the very high frequency omnidirectional range
	(VOR) signal. The up position on the ambiguity indicator is the same as the TO
	indicator in earlier versions of Flight Simulator.
	
	The down position on the ambiguity indicator indicates that the OBS is set to a
	radial leading away from the VOR signal. The down position on the ambiguity
	indicator is the same as the FROM indicator in earlier versions of Flight
	Simulator.
	
	If the ambiguity indicator is striped, the gauge is not receiving a usable
	navigation signal. A striped ambiguity indicator is the same as the OFF
	indicator in earlier versions of Flight Simulator.
