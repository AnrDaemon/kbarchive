	- Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a graphical object like a chart is copied from a Microsoft Office
	application and pasted into a page in FrontPage Editor, smudges may appear
	around any text on the image.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is caused by the converter that FrontPage uses to import images.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Method 1: Use an Image Editor
	-----------------------------
	
	Paste the object into an image editor, like Image Composer, and save it as a JPG
	file. Insert the saved JPG file in FrontPage Editor by clicking Image from the
	Insert menu.
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	In Office 97 only, save the Office object using the Save as HTML command from the
	File menu, and insert the HTM page in your FrontPage Web.
