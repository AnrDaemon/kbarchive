	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Electronic mail (from the Internet) abuse can cause system slow-downs, high
	usage of network bandwidth, undesirable usage of hard disk storage, and general
	annoyance for users by clogging their client inboxes.
	
	The following terms and abbreviations are often used to describe different kinds
	of network abuse:
	
	- spam (slang): A generic term describing various forms of electronic mail
	  abuse. A good general definition is as follows: "Spam is flooding the
	  Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the
	  message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it."

	- EMP (Excessive Multi-Posting): The same article (or essentially the same
	  article) posted an unacceptably high number of times to one or more
	  newsgroups. This is seen by NNTP clients and received by the Internet News
	  Service.
	
	- CROSS-POSTING: A single message instance that is posted to multiple news
	  groups. This is seen by NNTP clients and is received by the Internet News
	  Service. CROSS-POSTING takes up only one message in News Server, but appears
	  in more than one place. Cross-posting to relevant newsgroups is usually
	  considered appropriate. Cross-posting a message that is not relevant to
	  several newsgroups can be considered inappropriate.
	
	- UBE (Unsolicited Bulk E-mail): E-mail with substantially identical content
	  sent to many recipients who did not ask to receive it. This type of mail can
	  be seen in Exchange or POP3 clients, and is delivered through the Internet
	  Mail Service.
	
	- UCE (Unsolicited Commercial E-mail): E-mail containing commercial information
	  that has been sent to a recipient who did not ask to receive it. Most UBE is
	  UCE.
	
	- MMF (Make Money Fast): Usually chain letters or other mail that claims to be
	  able to make the recipient a lot of money. May be fraudulent or scam.
	
	- MLM (Multi-Level Marketing): A type of MMF scheme that includes sending money
	  in the form of an "initial investment" and encourages recruitment of others.
	  May be fraudulent or scam.
	
	- MAILBOMB: Delivering large amounts of e-mail with the sole purpose of
	  shutting down the recipients server or client, or to deny others legitimate
	  access to the server.
