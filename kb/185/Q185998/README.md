	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Systems Management Server is a Microsoft BackOffice product that
	provides a comprehensive solution for centralized management of computers in an
	enterprise network. It is a key component of the Microsoft solution for
	enterprise distributed systems management. Extending the capabilities built into
	Windows NT, Systems Management Server provides network administrators with a
	flexible method to centrally manage software and hardware on their corporate
	networks. Systems Management Server is an integrated system that provides these
	services:
	
	- Hardware and software inventory
	
	- Software distribution and installation
	
	- Managing shared network applications
	
	- Remote control and troubleshooting
	
	- Network protocol analysis
	
	Systems Management Server allows an administrator at a central location to
	perform these key management functions for client computers. This removes the
	need to physically touch a computer for inventory census, software
	installations, or problem diagnosis. Systems Management Server works within
	existing network environments to provide a complete resource management
	solution.
