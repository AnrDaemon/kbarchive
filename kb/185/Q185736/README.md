{% raw %}

	Article: Q185736
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): WinNT:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400sp4fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	An application running on Windows NT 4.0 may appear to be in an unresponsive
	state, yet no apparent error has occurred.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	A multithreaded application may use critical sections for thread
	synchronization. Failure by the application to release the critical section
	cleanly, or correctly handle a failed release, may result in it retaining a lock
	on this section. Windows NT will continue to retain this critical section lock
	because it has never been properly informed to release by the thread owner.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
