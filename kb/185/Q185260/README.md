	The information in this article applies to:

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using Remote Access Service (RAS) with third-party dial-in servers using
	Shiva Password Authentication Protocol (SPAP), a user account may be locked out
	if a wrong password is entered. This problem will only occur if account lockout
	is enabled.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if Windows NT has to retry the authentication request.
	Windows NT loses synchronization with the server. This causes Windows NT to
	retry the authentication requests until retries are exhausted.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
