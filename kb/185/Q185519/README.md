	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows Internet Services (WinInet) 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Vbinet.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to declare many of the WinInet
	functions in Visual Basic. You should be able to use the included declaration
	file for most of your Visual Basic applications that use the WinInet functions.
	
	The included file Wininet.bas contains declarations for a number of WinInet
	functions and constants that Visual Basic programmers can use from their
	applications. This is not an exhaustive list of declarations for WinInet
	functions but it does cover the most commonly used functions and almost all of
	the constant definitions.
	
	Some common Win32 function declarations are also included in this file.
	
	The Wininet.bas file needs to be included in another Visual Basic project. It can
	not be used as a Visual Basic project alone.
