	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you have only one Web browser installed on your computer, that browser is
	your default Web browser.
	
	If you have more than one Web browser installed on your computer, you are
	prompted to set each browser on your computer as your default Web browser every
	time you start that Web browser. The dialog boxes that prompt you to set the Web
	browser as your default Web browser contain check boxes you can select to
	prevent these dialog boxes from being displayed again.
	
	If the dialog boxes that prompt you to set a Web browser as your default Web
	browser are not displayed, use the appropriate method to set Microsoft Internet
	Explorer or a Netscape Web browser as your default Web browser.
	
	Set Microsoft Internet Explorer as Your Default Web Browser
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	To set Internet Explorer as your default Web browser:
	
	1. Start Internet Explorer.
	
	2. On the View menu (Internet Explorer 4.0) or Tools menu (Internet Explorer 5.0
	  and 6.0), click Internet Options.
	
	3. On the Programs tab, click the "Internet Explorer should check to see whether
	  it is the default browser" check box to select it, and then click OK.
	
	4. Quit and then restart Internet Explorer. When Internet Explorer restarts, you
	  are prompted to set Internet Explorer as your default Web browser.
	
	5. Click Yes.
	
	Set a Netscape Browser as Your Default Web Browser
	--------------------------------------------------
	
	Netscape browsers do not include a control for setting the default browser. To
	set a Netscape browser as your default Web browser, contact Netscape
	Communications or visit the Netscape Technical Support Web site at the following
	Netscape Web address:
	
	  http://www.netscape.com
	
	To change your default browser setting to Netscape, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Edit menu, click Preferences.
	
	2. In the Category window, double-click Advanced, and then click System.
	
	3. In HTML documents select "http: (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)" and "https:
	  (Secure HTTP)".
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	Technical Support FAQ's are available on the Netscape Technical Support Web site
	to step you through the process of setting a Netscape browser as your default
	Web browser.
