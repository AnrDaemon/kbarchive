	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A common question for Systems Management Server support is "How do I run queries
	against the Systems Management Server database?" Another common question is
	"Where can I find the Systems Management Server database schema?"
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The database schema is not published. Microsoft reserves the right to alter the
	database schema to improve performance or add functionality. A published schema
	would lend itself to static assumptions for access to Systems Management Server
	data. If the schema is changed, those assumptions are no longer valid.
	
	Because the schema is not available, Microsoft strongly recommends that you not
	query directly against the Systems Management Server database. Instead, you
	should perform queries for information from the database in one of two ways. You
	can query internally through the Systems Management Server Administrator
	program, or externally by using Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL
	Server, Crystal Reports, or similar programs, and then only through the Systems
	Management Server Views generated by Systems Management Server SQL View
	Generator.
