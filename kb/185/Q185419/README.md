	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you adjust the volume in Monster Truck Madness 2, the volume of the video
	clips that play at the end of each race is not affected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the volume of the video clips is controlled by the
	volume setting in Microsoft Windows, not by the volume setting in Monster Truck
	Madness 2.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, adjust the volume of the video clips by adjusting the
	Windows volume setting. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	NOTE: Changing the Windows volume setting changes the volume for all sounds in
	Windows.
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Multimedia.
	
	3. On the Audio tab, move the Volume slider in the Playback area to the volume
	  level you want, and then click OK.
	
	4. Close Control Panel.
