	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outwars, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Outwars, the music and sound effects in the game may
	sound distorted or the speakers or headphones may crackle and pop.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if Outwars transmits sound to the speakers or headphones
	at a higher volume level or higher bass level than the speakers or headphones
	are designed to play.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
	
	1. If you use amplified speakers or headphones, verify that they are connected
	  to the Line Out jack on the sound card. If you use non-amplified speakers or
	  headphones, verify that they are connected to the Speaker Out jack on the
	  sound card.
	
	2. Start Outwars. If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next step.
	
	3. On the Outwars startup screen, click Options.
	
	4. Click Sound.
	
	5. In the Sound Options screen, click the left Bass arrow to reduce the bass
	  level in the game.
	
	  NOTE: The Bass and Treble controls in Outwars do not affect audio output if
	  your sound card does not support bass and treble adjustments.
	
	6. If the issue continues to occur, click the left Master Volume arrow to reduce
	  the volume level in the game.
	
	7. Click OK, and then click Back.
