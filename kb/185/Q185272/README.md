	When you create a new document or open an existing document, the Office
	Assistant may disappear or it may not be available, or both.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You have an open document and are in-place editing an OLE object (such as a

	Switch back to the document (on the Window menu, click the document) containing
	the OLE object, and move the insertion point out of the OLE object so that you
	are no longer in-place editing. In some cases, you may need to close and then
	reopen the document containing the OLE object.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
