	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click a game room link in the Zone, the wrong game room may be
	displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue can occur if either of the following conditions are true:
	
	- You used a shortcut you created for an earlier version of the Zoneto enter
	  the game room. Shortcuts created for earlier versions of the Zone may no
	  longer point to the same game room.
	- An older version of the Web page for the game room is stored in your Internet
	  cache.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method.
	
	Remove Old Shortcuts
	--------------------
	
	If you attempted to enter the game room using a shortcut, delete the shortcut.
	Because the Zone now uses JavaScript to open game rooms, you can no longer make
	a shortcut directly to a game room.
	
	Empty Your Internet Cache
	-------------------------
	
	To do this, use the appropriate method for your Web browser.
	
	Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and Later:
	
	1. On the View menu (Internet Explorer 4.x) or Tools menu (Internet Explorer
	  5.0), click Internet Options.
	
	2. Under Temporary Internet Files, click Delete Files, and then click Yes or OK.
	
	3. Click Settings.
	
	4. Under "Check for newer versions of stored pages," click "Every time you start
	  Internet Explorer".
	
	5. Click OK, and then click OK again.
	
	6. Quit and then restart Internet Explorer.
	
	7. Connect to the Zone.
