	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can use the CB Radio feature in Monster Truck Madness 2 to talk to other
	players when you are preparing to play or are playing a multiplayer game.
	
	For the CB Radio to function, you must have a properly configured 16-bit sound
	card with a microphone installed in your computer. To configure the sound card
	to use the CB Radio, follow these steps:
	
	1. Verfify that the Microsoft Windows Sound Recorder and Volume Control tools
	  are installed on your computer.
	
	  If you see a yellow speaker icon on the taskbar, the Windows Sound Recorder
	  and Volume Control tools are installed. If you do not see the icon on the
	  taskbar, install the Windows Sound Recorder and Volume Control tools. To do
	  this, follow these steps:
	
	  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  b. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
	
	  c. On the Windows Setup tab, click Multimedia in the Components box, and then
	     click Details.
	
	  d. Click the Sound Recorder and Volume Control check boxes to select them,
	     and then click OK.
	
	  e. Click OK. You may be prompted for your Windows CD-ROM or disks.
	
	  f. Close Control Panel.
	
	2. Use Windows Sound Recorder to test the microphone. To do this, follow these
	  steps:
	
	  a. Double-click the speaker icon on the taskbar.
	
	  b. On the Options menu, click Properties.
	
	  c. Under Adjust Volume For, click Recording.
	
	  d. Click to select the Microphone check box, and then click OK.
	
	  e. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
	     Entertainment or Multimedia, and then click Sound Recorder.
	
	  f. Click the Record button, and speak into the microphone. When you finish
	     speaking, click the Stop button. Click the Play button to play back the
	     sound clip you recorded using the microphone.
	
	  g. If the volume is too soft or too loud, move the Microphone Volume slider
	     up or down in the Recording Control window, and then use Sound Recorder to
	     test the microphone level again. Repeat this step until you find a volume
	     level that is acceptable to you.
	
	     NOTE: You may also need to adjust the volume of your speakers to find an
	     acceptable volume level.
	
	3. Start Monster Truck Madness 2.
	
	4. On the Options menu, click Sound.
	
	5. Under CB Radio, click the left or right Amplification arrows to adjust the
	  volume of your CB Radio transmissions. If a 16-bit sound card is installed in
	  your computer, we recommend you do not select the Full Duplex option. When
	  you are finished adjusting the volume level, click OK.
	
	  NOTE: You may need to lower the volume level of other game sounds to hear CB
	  radio transmissions clearly.
	
	6. Click Driver Check-In, and then click Multiplayer to host or join a
	  multiplayer game.
	
	7. Click the CB Radio button to activate the CB radio feature. When the CB Radio
	  appears on the screen; speak into the microphone to talk to other players.
	  This window contains a signal strength meter to show your transmission
	  strength. To ensure that your voice is heard on all of the other players'
	  computers, fill the meter completely when you speak. Because only one person
	  at a time can talk on the CB radio, click Stop Transmitting when you finish
	  speaking to listen to the other players' replies.
	
	  To use the CB radio when you are playing a game, press and hold down the R key
	  when you talk. When you press the R key, a signal strength meter appears on
	  the screen.
