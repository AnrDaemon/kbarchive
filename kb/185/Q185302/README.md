	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Macintosh operating system 8.0 and 8.1 clients cannot copy files from CD-ROMs
	shared on computers running both Windows NT Server 4.0 and Services for
	Macintosh. When copying files from a CD-ROM, you receive the following error:
	
	  File not found
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Macintosh client is looking for a resource fork on the shared CD-ROM volume
	on a Services for Macintosh server, which it does not find and ends the request
	with the error message.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 and
	Services for Macintosh version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
	post additional information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
