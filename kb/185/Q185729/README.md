	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run CGI multiple stress instances on an Internet Information Server
	(IIS) version 3.0 server on a Windows NT FAT partition server, you may see I/O
	on the computer come to a halt. On NTFS, the same thing may occur, but at a much
	slower rate of deadlock. The difference is entirely due to architectural issues
	of the synchronization done in the two file system drivers.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
