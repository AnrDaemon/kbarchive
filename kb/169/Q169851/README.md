	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Outlook Web Access version 5.5, the option to post to a public
	folder is enabled even if a user does not have write access to the public
	folder.
	
	If the user attempts to post a message, the following error message is
	displayed:
	
	  You do not have the necessary permissions to post to this folder.
	  Contact your Exchange Administrator for assistance or choose another folder.
	
	The message is not posted if the user does not have write access. This behavior
	is by product design.
