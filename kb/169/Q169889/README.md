	- Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit Part 1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit includes a Mailbox Migration Tool. The
	documentation included for this tool is incomplete. In addition, the help file
	does not include the correct bitmap for the user interface.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The purpose of the tool is to make a complete copy of the mailbox content from
	one server to another when the servers are in different sites or organizations.
	A help file, Exchtool.hlp is included with the BackOffice Resource Kit that
	documents the Mailbox Migration Tool and the other tools included in the
	Resource Kit.
	
	The help file (Exchtool.hlp) section "Running the Mailbox Migration Tool" does
	not include the correct bitmap for the user interface. The released Migrate.exe
	includes a Log File option that allows you to choose the path to the log file or
	to allow you to append an existing log file. This option is missing from the
	help file and the description for the option is also missing from the help file.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
