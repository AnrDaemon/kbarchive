	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When you print a custom envelope to a Hewlett Packard (HP) 5si MX, or HP 5n
	printer from Word 7.0 running on Windows NT 4.0, your text may be printed in
	portrait rather than landscape orientation.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when you print a custom envelope with a height greater than
	4.25 inches.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you have an HP 5n printer, downloading and installing the updated HP 5n NT
	printer driver (version 3.71) corrects the problem.
	
	NOTE: If you have an HP 5si MX printer, this does not correct the problem.
