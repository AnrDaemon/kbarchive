## Q169399: High-Color Icons Displayed in 256-Color Mode

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When Windows 95 is running in a video resolution with 256 colors, high- color
	icons may be displayed instead of the 256-color icons. These icons may look
	distorted or washed out because of the lack of colors available to display them
	with.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The video resolution in Windows 95 was changed from a high-color resolution to a
	256-color resolution using the QuickRes program.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Restart the computer to cause Windows 95 to use the correct icons for the
	current video color depth.
	
	Note that the opposite behavior occurs if the color depth is changed from 256
	colors to high color. This causes the 256-color icons to be used instead of the
	high-color icons.
