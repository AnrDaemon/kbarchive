	Windows 95 that already has an MS-DOS prompt open, the batch file runs twice.
	This behavior may also occur with other executable files that are started
	remotely.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
