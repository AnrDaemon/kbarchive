	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	An active chat session between a computer running the Systems Management Server
	Administrator program and a Systems Management Server client may be unexpectedly
	closed. This problem may occur if the administrator is typing a message and the
	client is simultaneously performing a drag and drop operation on a window, icon,
	and so on. This behavior affects Windows 95 and 16-bit Windows clients, but does
	not occur on Windows NT clients.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
