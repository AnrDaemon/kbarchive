	SUMMARY

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Windows NT, flashes may occur regardless of the color depth or wallpaper
	settings.
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Palette flashes may occur if you have a desktop wallpaper selected and your
	Color Palette setting on the Settings tab of the Display Properties dialog box
	has been set to 256 colors. Palette flashes can occur when switching between
	Mastering Web Site Development and other running applications, or when starting
	or stopping animations, videos, or demonstrations.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent palette flashes, either set your display color depth to High
	Color(16-bit) or True Color(24-bit), or set your wallpaper to None in the
	Display Properties dialog box. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to settings, and then click
	  Control Panel.
	
	2. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.
	
	3. In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Settings tab.
	
	4. Under Color Palette, select High Color(16-bit) or True Color(24-bit) Color.
	  Click Apply, and then click OK.
