	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The sound level of the program listed above is lower than most windows programs.
	It is most apparent in the Introduction to Chapter 7. In some cases, even with
	the volume maximized, some sounds may be difficult to hear.
	
	To remedy this, you may need to raise the sound level globally. Because this will
	cause louder than normal sounds in Windows, you return the volume level to your
	normal setting when you exit from the program.
	
	For more information about changing sound settings, see your Windows printed
	documentation or online Help, or the documentation that came with your sound
	card.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mastering Visual Basic
	5.0 Fundamentals, version 1.0. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
	post new information here as it becomes available.
	
	Additional query words: quiet silent hushed inaudible soft quietly 1.0
