	Microsoft implemented this functionality as a design change in Microsoft Word 97
	for Windows to prevent formatting problems that occur when you delete a section
	break in earlier versions of Word.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To remove a section break, select the section break and then do one of the
	following:
	
	- Press DELETE.
	
	  -or-
	
	- On the Edit menu, click Cut.
