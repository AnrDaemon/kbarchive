	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Performance Optimizer, it may fail
	and display the following error message:
	
	  The following drives could not be tested due to an error (drives affected).
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Performance Optimizer performs various tests on the drives during its
	optimization process. The error above can be generated when too little free
	space is available on the drive. Microsoft recommends a minimum of 10 MB free on
	each drive before running Performance Optimizer.
	
	The error may also be generated by actual problems with the drive. Look for drive
	errors in the Windows NT Event Viewer System log from before the Performance
	Optimizer was run. Errors about the drive generated while Optimizer is being run
	may be caused by too little free space.
	
	This behavior is by product design
