	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you are using Microsoft FrontPage for Windows version 1.1 with the Microsoft
	FrontPage 97 Server Extensions (version 2.0.3.209 or 2.0.2.1112) then, when you
	use a WebBot Include component that points to a page that contains an image map,
	the image appears to be "broken" in FrontPage Editor.
	
	Although the image is broken in FrontPage Editor, the image map itself is not
	affected, and it is displayed correctly in a Web browser.

	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, upgrade to Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows.
	
	STATUS

	97 for Windows with Bonus Pack.
