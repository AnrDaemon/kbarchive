	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	There is a small time window in Afd.sys (the Microsoft Winsock2 service provider
	for TDI transport) where it does not indicate data received immediately after a
	connection is accepted. This window should affect only applications that use
	AcceptEx with buffer space for receiving data after a connection is accepted.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In TCP/IP, timewait state queue management has a problem that causes time wait
	states to exceed four minutes under stress.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
