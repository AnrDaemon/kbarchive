	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for the Macintosh on a computer running
	Mac OS System Software 7.1 or earlier, you may receive the following error
	message:
	
	  One or more files required for Apple Guide are missing. Help will not be
	  available. To correct this problem, reinstall from Encarta 97 Disc 1.
	
	After you reinstall Encarta 97, the error message still occurs when you start
	Encarta 97. Encarta is able to run, but Help is not available.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The 7.0/7.1 Apple Guide Enabler is not being loaded.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta 97
	Encyclopedia for the Macintosh. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
	post new information here as it becomes available.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Make sure that the 7.0/7.1 Apple Guide Enabler is in the Extensions folder. To
	check for this extension, do the following:
	
	1. Double-click your hard drive icon, then double-click your System Folder.
	
	2. Double-click the Extensions.
	
	3. Try to locate the 7.0/7.1 Apple Guide Enabler. If it is not there, continue
	  with step 4. If you do see the 7.0/7.1 Apple Guide Enabler icon, it may be
	  corrupt. Drag the icon to the Trash and continue with step 4.
	
	4. In the Extensions folder, locate the Apple Guide Extension.
	
	5. Check your version of the Apple Guide using the following steps:
	  a. Click the Apple Guide icon.
	
	  b. On the File menu, select "Get Info."
	
	  c. Check the version information. Encarta 97 installs version 2.0.2. If you
	     have a later version, move the file to another folder on your hard drive.
	     If the Apple Guide is version 2.0.2, drag the Apple Guide to the Trash.
	
	6. Reinstall Encarta 97 from disc 1.
	
	After following the instructions above, Encarta 97 should install both version
	2.0.2 of Apple Guide and the required 7.0/7.1 Apple Guide Enabler.
