## Q169019: XWEB: Dates Displayed in MM/DD/YY Instead of DD/MM/YY

	Article: Q169019
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When you are viewing an Exchange Inbox via the Microsoft Exchange Active Server
	Components, the date an item was received appears in the standard US format of
	MM/DD/YY. This occurs although you expect to see DD/MM/YY.
	
	With some Internet browsers and operating systems you can specify British English
	as the language (for example, in the Windows operating systems you can select
	English [United Kingdom]). In this case, you would expect the date to appear as
	DD/MM/YY, in accordance with the way dates are written in the United Kingdom.
	However, the date still appears as MM/DD/YY.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
