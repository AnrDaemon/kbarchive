	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	Users and administrators of Netscape Messenger will find that messages with
	priority values are recognized on messages from Netscape messaging systems only.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Netscape employs a priority header scheme that most mail systems do not
	recognize. Messages sent from Microsoft messaging systems are not received with
	their priority values intact.
