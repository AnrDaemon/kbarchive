	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Mastering Visual Basic 5.0 Fundamentals on a computer that
	already has ActiveMovie 2.0 or later installed, you will be asked if you want to
	replace the existing version of ActiveMovie. If you choose Yes, ActiveMovie 2.0
	will be replaced by ActiveMovie 1.0.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The installer does not detect a newer version of ActiveMovie on the computer and
	will replace it with an older version.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or any application that
	installs ActiveMovie 2.0, choose No when prompted by the ActiveMovie installer.
	
	If the ActiveMovie 1.0 installer overwrites ActiveMovie 2.0, you must reinstall
	the application that originally installed ActiveMovie 2.0.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mastering Visual Basic 5.0
	Fundamentals. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
