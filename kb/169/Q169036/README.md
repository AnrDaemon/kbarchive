	- Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection 
	- Microsoft Plus! Game Pack: Cards and Puzzles 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start The Puzzle Collection in one of the Microsoft programs listed at
	the beginning of this article and then click a button on the toolbar to start a
	game, nothing may happen.
	
	In addition, you may be unable to uninstall either of the programs listed at the
	beginning of this article.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you use the Regional Settings tool in Control Panel
	to change your language settings after you install one of the programs listed at
	the beginning of this article.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, restore the Regional Settings that were in effect when
	you installed The Puzzle Collection or Plus! Game Pack.
	
	If you want to keep the new Regional Settings and still play either of the games
	listed at the beginning of this article:
	
	1. Restore the Regional Settings that were in effect when you installed The
	  Puzzle Collection or Plus! Game Pack.
	
	2. Uninstall The Puzzle Collection or Plus! Game Pack.
	
	3. Configure the Regional Settings that you want to use.
	
	4. Reinstall the game.
	
	Setup checks your Regional Settings, and then automatically installs the correct
	language version of the game.
	
	NOTE: If Windows is configured to use a language that is not supported in the
	game, Setup installs the English language version of the game.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
