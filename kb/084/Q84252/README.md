	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may be unable to print TrueType fonts from Microsoft Windows version 3.1 to
	a Kyocera Q8010 PostScript printer. If you try to do so, you may receive a blank
	page instead of a printout of your document.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	According to Kyocera Technical Support, the printer ROM of the Q8010 is
	incompatible with the Windows 3.1 TrueType downloading method. To correct this
	problem, either purchase the Kyocera ROM upgrade version 2.08, or set the
	printer to HP LaserJet Series II emulation mode and print with the HP LaserJet
	Series II driver provided with Windows 3.1.
