	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you select the Fonts dialog box in applications developed prior to the
	Microsoft Windows version 3.1, TrueType fonts will not display the TrueType (TT)
	font identifier.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Applications created prior to Windows 3.1 may not be designed to take advantage
	of common dialog box features. If the application does not use the common dialog
	box features, it will not display the font identifier to the left of each font
	in the font dialog box.
	
	TrueType fonts may still be available and work correctly with some of these
	applications. Contact the manufacturer of your specific application to obtain
	information on TrueType compatibility.
