	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you move a message with an object linking and embedding (OLE) object to a
	shared folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the
	icon next to the message does not display a paperclip. If you move the message
	back to a private folder, the paperclip icon reappears.
	
	This occurs only with OLE objects, not with regular file attachments.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
