	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When creating a Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Gateway to Fax cover page
	with MailSender, it is rasterized at 200-by-200 dpi. Because the cover page is
	rasterized at 200-by-200 dpi, a cover page will not be sent when the 200-by-100
	dpi "Fastest" resolution option is selected in the Gateway Accounts screen for a
	particular account.
	
	No warning is given when the account is configured this way.
