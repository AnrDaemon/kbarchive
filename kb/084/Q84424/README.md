	When using the numerical values 0, 1, 2, 6, 8 in the Lucida Calligraphy
	typeface that comes with the Microsoft Font Pack for Microsoft Windows
	version 3.1, the characters may appear to be floating. This is caused by
	the 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 characters dipping below the baseline in what is
	referred to as "old-style numerics." Lucida Blackletter also does this.
	
	This is a design feature of the typeface.
