	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The 32-bit disk access feature of Microsoft Windows version 3.1 may
	not work with the Microsolutions Compaticard.
	
	The Compaticard model 4 meets the 32-bit disk access requirements
	because it is Western Digital (WD) 1003 compatible. However, the
	Compaticard allows you to attach either external or internal floppy
	disk drives to your system. It has its own built-in BIOS that alters
	the I/O address.
	
	If you remove this BIOS, 32-bit disk access should work fine.
	
	For additional information on configuring the Compaticard, please
	contact Microsolutions.
	
	Compaticard is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
