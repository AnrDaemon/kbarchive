	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1 includes run- time
	libraries and header files compatible with version 6.0 of the Microsoft C
	Compiler. These files are on a separate floppy disk, which contains its own
	installation program.
	
	These files are required only to develop applications for Windows 3.1 using
	Microsoft C version 6.0. Many other development environments, including
	Microsoft QuickC for Windows and Microsoft C version 7.0, provide their own
	appropriate run-time libraries and header files.
	
	To install the run-time libraries and header files, run the INSTALL.BAT batch
	file on the "Microsoft C 6.0 Run-time Libraries" disk.
	
	For more information on the C run-time libraries provided with the Windows SDK
	version 3.1, see page 3 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit:
	Getting Started" manual.
	
	For more information on installing the Windows SDK version 3.1, including an
	article that provides the recommended installation procedure, query on the
	following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  " windows and sdk and setupinst " (without the quotation marks)
