	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print to an Epson LQ-2250 or Epson Action Printer 3260 or another
	dot-matrix printer from Microsoft Windows version 3.1, small horizontal gaps may
	appear in characters or graphics. The size of the gap, if any, may vary from one
	type of printer to another.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a limitation of the printer. Some dot-matrix printers cannot print
	graphics without a small gap between each pass of the print head. The Windows
	printer driver cannot work around this.
