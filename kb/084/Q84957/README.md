	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you use Media Player to play an audio compact disc, the disc does not
	automatically return to the beginning after playing.
	
	To work around this problem, do one of the following:
	
	- From Media Player's Devices menu, choose CDAudio. This will cause the CD to
	  return to the first track.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Drag the thumb back to the start of the first track. Note: This may not work
	  if the CD-ROM drive uses the TSLCDR.SYS driver.
