	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows operating environment supports a network installation option where
	Windows is placed on a server. Even though each workstation runs the
	installation program to create a personal configuration file, the majority of
	the files exist only on the server and are accessed over the network.
	
	The Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) is not designed to support this method
	of installation. Each workstation must have a complete copy of the SDK
	installed. The SDK should be installed from the disks that are included in the
	retail package.
