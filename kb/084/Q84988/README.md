	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The portable Zenith MastersPort may have mouse problems after reviving from its
	rest feature when running Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 with a
	bus mouse.
	
	An update for the Zenith Flash BIOS is available on CompuServe in the Zenith
	forum (GO ZENITH) or by contacting any Zenith dealer. The file on CompuServe is
	called MPSL3.EXE and is in the library section. This file is compressed and
	self-extracting.
	
	Any questions regarding the file MPSL3.EXE or the BIOS update should be directed
	to Zenith Data Systems at (800) 227-3360.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The MastersPort can shut itself down to preserve battery power. Once the machine
	is reactivated, a software program will continue where it left off. However, if
	Windows version 3.1 is running with a bus mouse, the mouse will either be frozen
	on the screen or "rubber banded" to the screen border (that is, when the mouse
	is moved, it will jerk back to the border as if it were attached to it with a
	rubber band).
	
	The MastersPort is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
	warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
