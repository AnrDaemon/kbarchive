	The Notepad application in Windows 3.1 formats text without considering the
	restrictions of the output device. For example, if a line in a Notepad file
	exceeds the printer's margin limits, the printer truncates the line so that
	it fits on the printable page. The resulting printout may therefore contain
	carriage returns that are inconsistent with the Notepad display. If you use
	the Notepad Word Wrap feature, the printout also contains the original
	carriage returns inserted by Notepad, and may appear to be extremely
	truncated.
