	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet driver (HPDSKJET.DRV) for the HP
	DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, HP DeskJet 500, or HP DeskJet 560c, incorrect TrueType
	font output may result when a third-party screen driver is installed. Installing
	one of the standard screen drivers provided with Windows 3.1 should correct this
	problem.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This information applies only to the HPDSKJET driver provided with Windows 3.1,
	not to the DJ500C.DRV HP DeskJet driver provided by Hewlett-Packard. The easiest
	way to tell the difference between these two drivers (other than examining the
	contents of the WIN.INI file) is to see how the printer is described in Control
	Panel. The driver written by HP lists the printer name as "HP Deskjet Series v
	2.x", where 2.x is either 2.0 or 2.1. The driver provided with Windows 3.1 lists
	the printer name as "HP Deskjet", "HP Deskjet Plus", or "HP Deskjet 500".
