	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Under Microsoft Windows version 3.1, you must use the IBM Graphics printer
	driver to print correctly to a Diconix 300W printer. The printer documentation
	provided with the Diconix 300W lists the Epson FX-100+ and the Epson FX-185 as
	the emulation modes for the printer. If either of these printer drivers are used
	with the Diconix 300W, you receive the following error message:
	
	  Cannot print to LPT1:
	
	Use the IBM Graphics driver to eliminate this problem.
