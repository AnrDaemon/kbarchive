	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Sound Recorder is a program provided with Windows that is used to play, edit,
	and record sound files.
	
	Sound Recorder requires an appropriate device and device driver to record sounds.
	Some devices such as the original Adlib sound card (not Adlib Gold) and PC
	Speaker driver are not able to record because they do not have the appropriate
	hardware to do so.
	
	To verify if the device supports recording, check for an input device on the
	audio card or check the device's documentation.
	
	For further help verifying the capabilities of an audio device, contact the
	manufacturer of the device for assistance.
