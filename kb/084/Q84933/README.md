	resets the player to the first track of the CD.

	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Run Media Player from the Accessories group.
	
	2. From the Device menu, choose CD Audio Player, making sure there is an audio
	  disc in the drive.
	
	3. Play the CD and allow it to play to the end or seek near the end of the disc
	  by sliding the seek bar.
	
	Shortly after reaching the end of the CD, the seek bar should jump to the first
	track of the CD. However, on some systems the bar will remain at the end of the
	CD.
