	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Windows Setup may stop responding (hang) when upgrading from Windows
	3.0 if the Xerox Panorama driver is installed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	IME Computers has confirmed that their Xerox Panorama-IME two page display
	drivers for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 are incompatible with Windows version
	3.1.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	According to IME, the Xerox Panorama video card is CGA and Hercules monochrome
	compatible. If you are upgrading from Windows 3.0 to 3.1, choose either the CGA
	or Hercules driver for proper installation and operation of Microsoft Windows
	3.1.
	
	NOTE: The CGA video driver is not included with Windows 3.1. Use the Hercules
	driver that that is included or obtain the CGA driver from the Windows Driver
	Library.
	
	
	The IME product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
