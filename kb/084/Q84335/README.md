	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Canon LBP-4, LBP-8 II, and LBP-8 III drivers (LBPII.DRV and LBPIII.DRV)
	disable the TrueType fonts unless the graphics resolution is set to 300 x 300.
	Using the 150 x 150 or the 75 x 75 setting under graphics in the printer setup
	section of these Canon printers disables the TrueType fonts.
	
	This also applies to the HP DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, and DeskJet 500 driver
	(HPDSKJET.DRV). The resolution must be set for 300 dpi for the TrueType fonts to
	appear in applications.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. Both of these types of printers print TrueType fonts strictly
	as a rasterized graphic image.
