	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The keystrokes to bring a specific card to the front of a file in Microsoft
	Windows Cardfile are different from the keystrokes used in the Windows 3.0
	Cardfile program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In the Windows 3.0 Cardfile program, to bring a specific card to the front of
	the file, hold down the CTRL key and type a letter. A card beginning with that
	letter is moved to the foreground.
	
	In the Windows 3.1 Cardfile program, to bring a specific card to the front of the
	file, hold down the CTRL+SHIFT keys and press the appropriate letter to bring a
	specific card to the front of a file.
	
	For example, in the Windows 3.0 Cardfile program, pressing CTRL+W would display
	the first card in the file that starts with the letter "W". In the Windows 3.1
	Cardfile program, pressing CTRL+SHIFT+W will display the first card with the
	letter "W".
