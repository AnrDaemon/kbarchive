	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you run WordPerfect for Windows with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and select
	the Texas Instruments (TI) OmniLaser printer driver, WordPerfect may add
	unexpected formatting characters (such as tabs and spaces) to the current
	document.
	
	This printer driver does not add unexpected formatting when used with other
	applications, such as Microsoft Windows Write. Also, WordPerfect for Windows
	does not add extra formatting characters when used with other Windows 3.1
	printer drivers, such as the HP LaserJet III.
