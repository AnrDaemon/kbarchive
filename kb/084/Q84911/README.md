	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you attempt to paste text into Paintbrush while in Zoom Out mode, the
	following message is displayed:
	
	  Only Text is available on the Clipboard.
	
	  To paste text, use the Zoom Out command, select the Text tool and the
	  positions for pasting, and then select the Paste command.
	
	This information is incorrect. The second paragraph should read:
	
	  To paste text, use the Zoom In command, select the Text tool and the
	  positions for pasting, and then select the Paste command.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
