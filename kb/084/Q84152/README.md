	Microsoft Windows version 3.1 supports Linotype PostScript typesetters
	differently than Windows version 3.0 does.
	
	The list of specific models supported by Windows 3.1 differs from the list of
	models supported by Windows 3.0, and the Extra paper size options are not
	included in Windows 3.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Under Windows 3.0, the Linotype 100, 300, and 500 models are supported by the
	PostScript printer driver. Under Windows 3.1, these specific models are
	supported by the 200/230, 330, and 530 drivers, respectively. However, problems
	have been reported when the newer drivers are used with the Linotype 100, 300,
	and 500.
	
	Under Windows 3.0, the Linotype 100, 300, and 500 models support the Extra paper
	sizes Letter-Extra, Legal-Extra, A4-Extra, and Tabloid-Extra. Under Windows 3.1,
	these sizes are supported by the PostScript driver.
