	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Artisoft has confirmed that Windows may hang in 386 enhanced mode with LANtastic
	Z version 4.0 if parallel instead of serial cable connection(s) are used.
	
	LANtastic Z version 4.1 will allow using parallel connections in the 386 enhanced
	mode of Windows 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.1, but LANtastic Z is slow and unstable if
	parallel connections are used in this instance.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When parallel connections are used with LANtastic Z versions 4.0 or 4.1, Windows
	3.0 or 3.0a should be run in either real or standard mode and Windows 3.1 should
	be run in standard mode.
	
	LANtastic Z is a Windows-compatible peer-to-peer network system that allows two
	IBM-compatible computers to be connected through their serial or parallel ports
	by serial cable, parallel cable, or modem.
	
	LANtastic Z is manufactured by Artisoft, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
