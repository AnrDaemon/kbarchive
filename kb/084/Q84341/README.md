	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Windows version 3.1 with an IBM Quietwriter III with the
	IBM cartridge #1318010 selected, the wrong fonts display in Windows- based
	applications. If you choose and print one of these incorrect fonts, the printer
	displays the following error message:
	
	  Font Error
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The font cartridge #1318010 should have the following fonts: Artisan, Letter
	Gothic 12 CPI, Gothic 17 CPI, and Title PS. However, when the above cartridge is
	chosen in Windows 3.1, the fonts that are listed in Windows-based applications
	(including Write) are: Boldface Italic PS, Courier Italic 12 CPI, Modern PS,
	Prestige Elite 12 CPI.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows version 3.1
	Quietwriter printer driver. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here as it becomes available.
