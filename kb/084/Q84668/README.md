	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Associate command included with the Windows version 3.1 File Manager allows
	you to associate a data file extension (.XXX) with a certain program or Program
	Information File (PIF). If you use this command, the optional parameters
	specified in the PIF are not used.
	
	The optional parameters specified in a PIF work only when no other parameters are
	specified.
	
	This behavior is by design. There is no workaround to this limitation.
	
	MORE INFORMATION

	application.
