	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	CorelDRAW! is a graphic design application with powerful text manipulation
	capabilities. To perform these functions, version 2.x of CorelDRAW! uses special
	outline fonts internal to the application, or fonts imported through the
	CorelDRAW! WFNBOSS.EXE utility.
	
	At this time, the WFNBOSS utility does not provide the ability to import TrueType
	fonts for use in CorelDRAW!.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If text is pasted into CorelDRAW! that was copied or cut from another
	application, CorelDRAW! converts it to one of the internal CorelDRAW! fonts for
	display or manipulation.
	
	For these reasons, TrueType and other fonts that are visible in Write or other
	Windows applications are not available in CorelDRAW!.
	
	CorelDRAW! is manufactured by Corel Corporation, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
