	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A version of the Windows 3.1 Help Compiler which has been enhanced to use
	extended memory is now available in the Microsoft Download Center. The extended
	memory version of the Windows 3.1 Help Compiler (HCP.EXE) generates files for
	the Windows 3.1 Help application. As with all previous versions of the Windows
	Help Compiler, the new version runs under MS-DOS. However, the new version
	requires extended memory and is best run in an MS- DOS session under Windows.

	Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
	posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
	servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.
	
	The size and complexity of the files processed by earlier versions of the Windows
	Help Compiler is constrained by the amount of free MS-DOS memory available at
	compile time. This capacity constraint has caused difficulties for some
	developers creating very large files for Windows Help. The HCP.EXE application
	removes this capacity constraint.

	"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programming Tools" for version 3.1
	manual.
