	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you click a button on a toolbar that has been copied from another template,
	the button does nothing and no message appears.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you copy a toolbar from another template using the Organizer, Word does not
	copy the macros associated with the toolbar buttons. When you click a button in
	the new template, Word looks for the macro that goes with the button and cannot
	find it.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use the Organizer to copy the original template's macros.
	
	The Organizer allows you to copy items from one template to another template,
	from one document to another document, or from one document to a template. The
	Organizer can copy styles, macros, toolbars, and AutoText.
	
	To use the Organizer, on the Tools menu, point to Macro, click Macros, and then
	click Organizer.
