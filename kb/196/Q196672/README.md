	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Background Repagination option is selected and is unavailable (dimmed) for
	you to clear (turn off).
	
	To locate this option, on the Tools menu, click Options and select the General
	tab.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because you are viewing the current document in page layout
	view. By design, page layout view requires that Background Repagination be
	turned on, because Word must show the page breaks correctly.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To turn off Background Repagination, change the document view to normal,
	outline, or master document view.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Repagination in Word cannot be totally turned off. This is because Word has to
	repaginate the document in page layout view and in print preview in order to
	correctly display the document.
