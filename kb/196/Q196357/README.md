	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Page viii: Typo In Step 4
	-------------------------
	
	Change:
	"Type d:\ebook\mstp\setup.exe (where d the letter of your CD-ROM drive letter."
	
	To:
	"Type d:\ebook\mstp\setup.exe (where d is the letter of your CD-ROM drive
	letter.)"
	
	
	Page viii: Incorrect Path For Internet Explorer Setup File.
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	Introduction, page viii, second paragraph:
	
	The path listed for Internet Explorer 4.01 setup file is not correct. The correct
	path is d:\IE401\ie4setup.exe.
	
	Change:
	"To install Internet Explorer 4.01 from the CD, choose Run from the Start menu,
	and then type d:\IE40\ie4setup.exe ..."
	
	To:
	"To install Internet Explorer 4.01 from the CD, choose Run from the Start menu,
	and then type d:\IE401\ie4setup.exe ..."
	
	
	Page viii: Electronic Book Requires Internet Explorer
	-----------------------------------------------------
	
	On page viii, the first paragraph states that most browsers will work to view the
	online version of this book. In fact, Internet Explorer 4.0 or later is
	required.
	
	The electronic book requires some components of Internet Explorer 4.0 to be
	installed on the computer. This is because it uses the .CHM file format,
	allowing us to place searchable content in a compact form onto the CD-ROM. Only
	Internet Explorer can currently read this file format.
	
	Change:
	"While you can use most Web browsers to view the online version of this book, the
	text is best viewed in Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01."
	
	To:
	"The text in the online version of this book is best viewed in Microsoft Internet
	Explorer 4.01."
	
	
	Page ix: Typo In Step 4
	-----------------------
	
	Page ix, step 4:
	Change:
	"Type d:\ebook\mstp\setup.exe (where d the letter of your CD-ROM drive letter."
	
	To:
	"Type d:\ebook\mstp\setup.exe (where d is the letter of your CD-ROM drive
	letter.)"
	
	
	Page ix: Support URL Is Incorrect
	---------------------------------
	
	On page ix, under "Additional Information", the support URL is incorrect.
	
	Change:
	http://mspress.microsoft.com/mspress/support/
	
	To:
	http://mspress.microsoft.com/support/
	
	
	Page 101: Delete Laissez-faire
	------------------------------
	
	On Page 101, under the listing for "Foreign Words and Phrases", the
	interpretation of laissez-faire is incorrect. It does not translate to mean
	carefree.
	
	Change:
	"Avoid non-English words and phrases, such as laissez-faire or ad hoc..."
	
	To:
	"Avoid non-English words and phrases, such as ad hoc..."
	
	Also delete the entries "carefree" and "laissez-faire" from the table under the
	listing for Foreign Words and Phrases.
	
	
	Page 151: Text Correction
	-------------------------
	
	On Page 151, under the listing for "kludge, kludgy", the trademarked name
	Band-Aid is not capitalized.
	
	Change:
	"Slang. Do not use to refer to a band-aid fix..."
	
	To:
	"Slang. Do not use to refer to a bandage fix..."
	
	
	Page 173: Book And Ebook Do Not Match Boldface Typing
	-----------------------------------------------------
	
	Page 173, in the example titled Correct:
	
	The words "File" and "Open" are not bolded as they are in the electronic book.
	
	Replace the text in the book with:
	"On the File menu, click Open.
	From the File menu, choose Open."
	
	Where both instances of the words "File" and "Open" are bolded.
	
	
	Page 215: Incorrect Reference To Using "Press"
	----------------------------------------------
	
	The following note in the "Press" entry on page 215 contains an error:
	
	"It is acceptable to use Press to refer to Microsoft Press, if it is not done too
	often and if the full name is used frequently. Do not shorten to the Press or MS
	Press."
	
	Please use the full "Microsoft Press" name each time.
	
	
	Page 266: Use Taiwan Or Taiwan Region
	-------------------------------------
	
	On page 266 the listing for Taiwan is inaccurate.
	
	Change:
	"Use Taiwan or Province of Taiwan, not Republic of China or ROC, to refer to this
	province of the country of China."
	To:
	"Use Taiwan or Taiwan Region, not Republic of China or ROC."
	
	
	Computer Dictionary Ebook: Typographical Error
	----------------------------------------------
	
	The Microsoft Press Computer Dictionary ebook contains a typographical error. The
	word "identifies" is spelled incorrectly in the definition of "Template".
	
	In the definition of Template, change:
	"...an overlay for the keyboard that identifies special keys and key
	combinations."
	
	To:
	"...an overlay for the keyboard that identifies special keys and key
	combinations."
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
