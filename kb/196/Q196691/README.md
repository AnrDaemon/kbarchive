	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can use a Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 standard edition CD to join
	an Exchange Server 5.5 standard server.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Microsoft Exchange 5.5 standard CD includes all Microsoft Exchange
	connectors except the X.400 connector so no additional software is needed to
	create an Exchange Server 5.5 site with multiple servers. If the server you are
	joining is a standard pre-5.5 server, then you will need to either upgrade that
	server to Exchange Server version 5.5 or install the connector disk. If you do
	not, you will receive the following message:
	
	  Enter the full path of the Microsoft Exchange Server connector disk.
	
	NOTE: The Microsoft Exchange Server connector disk is a separate piece of
	software that can be purchased from Microsoft.
