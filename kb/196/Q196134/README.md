	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	Favorites can be added to your Internet browser to allow a quick return to a
	particular Universal Resource Locator (URL). When you use the Outlook Web Access
	client, it may be desirable to add a Favorite to allow quick access to a public
	folder. However, if you add a Public Folder to your Favorites, then change back
	to the Inbox, and then try to access the Public Folder through the Favorites
	list, it will not appear until you select the Refresh Page Address icon. This
	behavior only occurs when creating the initial Favorite. Quitting the browser
	and logging on to Outlook Web Access again will work correctly.
	
	STATUS

	the beginning of this article.
