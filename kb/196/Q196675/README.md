	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to apply shading to one or more words within a
	paragraph.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Word 97 for Windows, bordering and shading has been enhanced to enable you to
	easily border or shade a single word or several words.
	
	Use the following method to shade a single word or several words:
	
	1. Select the words you want to shade.
	
	2. On the Format menu, click Borders and Shading.
	
	3. Click the Shading tab.
	
	4. Select the shading color, style, and pattern you want. Under "Apply to",
	  select Text.
	
	5. Click OK.
	
	NOTE: In previous versions of Word, shading is not a paragraph format or
	character format. You cannot apply shading to a word by choosing Borders and
	Shading from the Format menu without affecting the entire paragraph, nor can you
	create a character style to apply the shading.
