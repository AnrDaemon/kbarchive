	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you save a Word document in another file format, and the document contains
	drop-down form fields, the text of the drop-down form fields is missing from the
	document when you reopen it.
	
	Text typed in text form fields is preserved.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To maintain the text in the drop-down form fields, save the file as Text Only
	With Line Breaks. Note that this method places a hard carriage return (paragraph
	mark) at the end of each line.
