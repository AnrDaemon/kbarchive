	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Word provides a way to type international characters that contain a
	grave (`), acute ('), circumflex (^), umlaut (:), or tilde (~) directly from
	your keyboard.
	
	For example, the following are some of the characters that can be typed with an
	accent directly from your keyboard:
	
	  
	  A a E e I i O o U u Y y
	
	NOTE: The names of the various accents may be different depending upon your
	language.
	
	For more information about typing international characters, click "Contents and
	Index" on the Help menu, click the Index tab in Microsoft Word Help, type the
	following text
	
	  international
	
	and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Type international
	characters" topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the
	Office Assistant.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To type an accented international character, follow these steps:
	
	1. While holding the CTRL key, type the character that will appear above the
	  letter.
	
	  NOTE: To add the tilde, colon, or caret character, press CTRL+SHIFT and then
	  type the character that will appear above the letter.
	
	  The status bar displays "CTRL+<key>" where <key> is the key that
	  you pressed, but nothing appears on the screen.
	
	2. Type the letter that you want. The accented character will appear in the
	  document.
	
	If you type a legitimate symbol and an ineligible letter, you hear a beep. If you
	press CTRL plus a symbol that is invalid, you see just the character with no
	symbol above it.
