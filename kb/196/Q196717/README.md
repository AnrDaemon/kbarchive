	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Grammar and Spelling commands do not identify "that that" or "had had" as
	repeated words. This behavior is different from that of earlier versions of
	Microsoft Word.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word. The Grammar and Spelling commands
	recognize that these two words can be repeated within a sentence. Although such
	constructions are not grammatically correct in the strictest sense, they are
	generally accepted in colloquial English.
