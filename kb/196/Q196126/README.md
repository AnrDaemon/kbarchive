	================
	
	CAUTION: To avoid possible damage (corruption) to your discussion Web, please
	keep the following in mind:
	
	- It is recommended that you replace unwanted text in each posted thread with
	  Content Removed by Moderator instead of deleting the entire page.
	
	- Never edit the Tocproto.htm page; this page is generated dynamically by
	  FrontPage, and editing it can permanently damage the discussion Web.
	
	To delete or edit a page in a discussion Web, follow these steps:
	
	1. Open the discussion Web in FrontPage.

	2. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings, and then click the Advanced tab.
	
	3. Under Options, click to select the "Show documents in hidden directories"
	  check box.
	
	4. Click Apply, click Yes, and then click OK.
	
	5. On the View menu, click Folders, and then expand the folder that contains the
	  pages in the discussion Web.
	
	6. Select the article that you want to edit or delete.
	
	  NOTE: Links to the individual articles are represented as links from the
	  Tocproto.htm page when you are in Hyperlink view. The address (URL) of each
	  discussion group article ends with an eight-digit integer. These addresses
	  are created in sequential order.
	
	   - To edit the article, open it and make the changes you want. Save the file
	     without changing the URL.
	
	   - To delete the article, open it and delete all the text in the article, or
	     replace it with a message like Content Removed by Moderator.
	
	     NOTE: Do not delete the article. Doing so can result in orphaned discussion
	     articles.
