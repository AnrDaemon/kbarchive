	Pages xxi-xxii: Installing sample files for Learn VJ Now
	--------------------------------------------------------
	
	Pages xxi and xxii, of Learn Visual J++ Now include instructions for "Installing
	the Sample Projects on Your Computer". These instructions need to be modified
	for the issue of Learn VJ Now that is included with the Visual J++ Deluxe

	Installation instructions should read:
	
	To install the samples
	
	1. Insert the Visual J++ Starts Here compact disc into your CD-ROM drive.
	
	2. Close the Installation window that appears.
	
	3. Click Start, point to Programs, and the click Windows Explorer. If you are
	  using Windows NT, click Windows NT Explorer.
	
	4. In the All Folders area, click the CD-ROM drive. The content of the CD-ROM
	  will appear.
	
	5. Double click the Learnvj folder to open it.
	
	6. Copy the Learnvj.exe file to your desktop.
	
	7. Double click on the Learnvj.exe file to extract the sample code and lab
	  projects. This will also save the files to your hard drive.
	
	You should now be able to access files that correspond directly with the book.
	The default location of those files will be C:\Learnvj.

	the Visual J++ 6.0 Deluxe Learning Edition, ISBN 1-57231-930-5. These changes do
	not apply to Learn Visual J++ Now, ISBN 1-57231-923-2.
	
	
	Page xxiii, Learn J++ Now: Software is not a trial version
	----------------------------------------------------------
	
	Page xxiii, Learn Visual J++ Now:
	
	Under the heading titled "Installing Visual J++ on Your Computer," the second
	sentence indicates that the software included is a 90-day trial version. This is
	inaccurate only when the book is included with the Deluxe Learning Edition
	package. If the book was bought by itself, the software is a 90-day trial
	edition.
	
	Change:
	
	  "This is a 90-day trial version of the Standard Edition of Microsoft
	  Visual J++."
	
	To:
	
	  "This is a Standard Edition of Microsoft Visual J++."
