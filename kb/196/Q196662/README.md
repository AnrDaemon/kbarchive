	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, folders on the desktop may not
	retain their settings after you log off or restart the computer. This may happen
	with folders created only on the desktop. If you open them on the desktop in a
	certain position, they should retain these settings when you log off and log on
	or when you restart the computer.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	This problem occurs only with folders on the desktop. To work around this
	problem, move the folders somewhere other than the desktop, if possible.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
	additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
