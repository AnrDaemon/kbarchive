	compatibility mode) as the database engine for Systems Management Server 1.2.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Architectural changes in SQL Server 7.0 introduce incompatibilities between SQL

	a limitation of Systems Management Server version 1.2, and is currently
	investigating possible resolutions for a future service pack.
