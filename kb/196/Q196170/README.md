	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When you start the Move Server Wizard and proceed to create a new site, a Yes/No
	dialog box is opened. If you press the F1 key for help, a message flashes very
	quickly on the screen before the Help topic for the dialog box's parent screen
	is opened. The message reads, "No help topic is associated with this item."
	However, it flashes across the screen too fast to be read.
	
	This behavior can be reproduced on each of the Yes/No and OK dialog boxes for the
	wizard.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Move Server Wizard component
	of Exchange Server version 5.5.
