	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 does not ship with the utility known as
	Load Simulator (Loadsim).
	
	Load Simulator is a multi-client messaging emulation tool for the MAPI protocol.
	It is used to test the performance of Microsoft Exchange Server under varying
	message loads. Specific workloads can be defined in Load Simulator to exercise
	servers in a controlled manner. This information can then be used to help
	determine the optimum number of users per server, identify performance
	bottlenecks, and evaluate server hardware performance.
	
	It is publicly available in both x86 and Alpha versions at the following URL:
