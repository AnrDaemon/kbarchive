	=======
	
	An Exchange Server Administrator can use the Microsoft Windows NT Unicode
	Character Map application to create Comma Separated Value (CSV) text files that
	contain International characters.
	
	The Unicode Character Map application uses the standard ANSI character set, which
	is compatible with the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

	Importing CSV files, which were created using MS-DOS text and the IBM PC
	Extended Character Set (ECS), will fail to create an object with the correct
	International characters.
