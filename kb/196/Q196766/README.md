	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Compare Documents does not recognize formatting changes as revisions to your
	document. For example, changing the font or paragraph characteristics; applying
	borders and shading; changing column formatting; and adding bullets, numbering,
	or heading numbering are not identified with revision marks when you run Compare
	Documents.
	
	In addition, Compare Documents does not identify additions or deletions of
	drawing objects, nor does it recognize changes to text within a text box.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	By design, Compare Documents recognizes text changes, such as additions or
	deletions of text to your document, but Compare Documents does not mark
	formatting changes you make to your text.
	
	With regard to Compare Documents not recognizing the addition, deletion, or
	alteration of drawing layer objects, Microsoft has confirmed this to be a
	problem in the Microsoft products listed above.
