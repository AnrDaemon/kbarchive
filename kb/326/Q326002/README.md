	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start a new game of Zoo Tycoon, there are fewer animals and buildings
	available than you expected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because most of the scenarios start with three to eight
	animals and a few buildings.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You have to complete the research and conservation programs before you can build
	new buildings and adopt new kinds of animals. Click "Research and Conservation"
	to increase funding in this area. You receive messages at the top of the screen
	when new animals and buildings are available.
