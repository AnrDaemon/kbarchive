	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A key goal of product support at Microsoft is to deliver the highest quality of
	support possible to its customers. To enable us to achieve and exceed this
	support goal, it is necessary to expire support for products that have reached
	the end of their life cycle.
	
	Each of these products has recorded low to zero support demand volume for a
	significant period of time (in some cases for up to nine years). In the majority
	of the cases, a replacement or substitute product with similar or advanced,
	user-friendly functionality has been identified. In those exceptional cases
	where it may be desirable for a customer to continue to use an obsolete product,
	a third-party support vendor has been recommended.
	
	A six-month notice regarding expiration of support on a given product is posted
	on this Web site. This period is intended to allow sufficient time for existing
	customers to move from a given discontinued product or to make arrangements for
	third-party support. Please bear in mind that only those products that have
	reached the end of their life cycle will have expired support. Expired support
	is defined as the discontinuation of any support provided directly by
	Microsoft.
	
	Microsoft's goals in implementing this policy are to:
	
	- Redirect resources to support current and future products and technology.
	- Maximize customer satisfaction by providing front-line Support Professionals
	  who are well trained in the latest Microsoft products and technologies.
