	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	An OpenGL program that makes thousands of calls to glVertex while trying to draw
	a polygon, may not work, and you may receive an access violation error message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur because a logic error can cause the code to proceed past
	the end of an array.
