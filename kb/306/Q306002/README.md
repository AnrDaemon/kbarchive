	- Microsoft Passport, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Participants must include all regional data, including country, region, and zip,
	in their flexible registration pages.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you create a flexible registration page, if regional information (such as
	country, region, or postal code) is needed, all of the information must be
	available together on a registration page. It is not possible to only have one
	entry or a combination of two on the registration page.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
