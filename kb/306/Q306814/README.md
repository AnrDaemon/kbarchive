	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click a Web link in Microsoft Bookshelf, your browser is redirected to
	a Microsoft Encarta Web site that contains links to Encarta.msn.com sites and
	the following message:
	
	  web links
	
	  We're sorry! This Internet resource is no longer available.
	
	As a result, you cannot connect to a Web site when you click the Web link for
	that site in Bookshelf.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the Bookshelf Web site, http://bookshelf.msn.com, is
	no longer available. Bookshelf has been replaced by Encarta World English
	Dictionary and other Encarta reference products and services such as Microsoft
	Encarta Encyclopedia Standard, Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe, Microsoft
	Encarta Reference Suite, Microsoft Encarta Online, and Microsoft Encarta Online
	Deluxe.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, copy the Web address of the link from the
	Bookshelf web links page to the Address bar of your browser, and then use your
	browser to connect to the Web site. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the web links page in Microsoft Bookshelf, select the link of the Web site
	  that you want to visit, right-click your selection, and then click Copy.
	
	2. Start Microsoft Internet Explorer, right-click anywhere in the Address bar,
	  and then click Paste.
	
	3. Press the ENTER key to connect to the Web site.
