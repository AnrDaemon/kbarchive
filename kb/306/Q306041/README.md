	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You receive the following error message:
	
	  0x800CCC78 SMTP_REJECTED_SENDER
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue occurs when you have an incorrect e-mail address in the "To" line of
	your reply message. You may have specified an alternate address for replies
	using Outlook Express.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Check the reply and e-mail addresses in account properties to be sure they both
	match and are msn.com addresses.
	Note: In some cases, removing the "reply" address may fix it as well.
	
	To resolve this issue
	
	1. Check the e-mail address in the To box.
	
	2. Select the e-mail address in the To box, right-click the message, and verify
	  that the e-mail address displayed matches the address in the Reply To box.
	  If the addresses in these two places match, please try to reply again. If the
	  addresses in these two places do not match, change the "reply-to" address for
	  your MSN account member ID in Configuration Settings.
