	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2002 - DVD Edition allows you to copy the
	product to the hard drive before you install it. During this process, the
	installation status bar moves to 100% (the full position), and stays there while
	files are being copied. That is, the installation status bar is at 100%,
	although the installation is not complete yet.
	
	Because the status bar does not show you how the installation is proceeding, the
	installation process may appear to stop responding (hang).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The installation process may appear to stop responding, but it is actually still
	copying files to the hard drive. Some files may take several minutes to copy,
	depending on the speed of your DVD-ROM drive.
	
	NOTE: Do not quit Setup until it is complete.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This type of installation may take 30 minutes or longer. To see how the
	installation is progressing, look at the file names, which change as each file
	is copied.
