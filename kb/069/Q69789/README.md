	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Aircraft & Scenery Designer, if you choose option 5, Dynamic Scenery
	Active, from the Scenery Designer menu to deactivate dynamic scenery, random
	dynamic scenery generated by Microsoft Flight Simulator version 4.00 will be
	unaffected. The Dynamic Scenery Active option only affects user-created dynamic
	scenery stored in the active DY1 file.
	
	Flight Simulator's own dynamic scenery may be turned off in the start-up menus,
	or by doing the following:
	
	1. From the Enviro menu, choose option E, Dynamic Scenery.
	
	2. Deactivate options 1-5 (when an option is active, it will be preceded by a +
	  [plus] sign).
