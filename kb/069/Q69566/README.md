	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you leave out a new name when renaming a file from Microsoft Windows version
	3.0 File Manager, the renamed file has the same name as the directory it is
	renamed from. For example, if you rename README.TXT without a new name within
	the Windows directory, the file's new name is WINDOWS, with no extension.
	
	NOTE: This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.
