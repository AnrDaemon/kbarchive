	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To reset the high scores in Tetris of the Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP1),
	delete or rename the file TETRIS.HST in the WEP directory. This will
	automatically rebuild itself the next time high scores are saved.
	
	The TETRIS.HST file is used specifically to store high scores. The file is
	re-created automatically anytime high scores are saved at the end of a Tetris
	session. The TETRIS.INI file is created to store player options, sound, piece
	preview, and the tracking of high scores.
