	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You receive the following error message when you run Microsoft Windows in
	standard mode on an Epson Equity III (286) computer:
	
	  Insufficient extended memory to run in standard mode; increase available
	  extended memory or run in real mode
	
	This occurs regardless of the amount of physical extended memory available on the
	system.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Epson technical support has confirmed that its Epson Equity III computer cannot
	run Windows 3.0 in standard mode. The inability to run standard mode cannot be
	controlled by means of any available HIMEM.SYS switches. Epson tested with the
	latest ROM BIOS available at the time.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Epson Equity III is no longer in production. For this reason Epson does not
	expect to provide a correction for this problem.
	
	The Epson Equity III Plus (286) computer has been reported to run standard mode
	without any reported problems. This is not to be confused with the older Epson
	Equity III that is referenced above. The Epson Equity III Plus is still being
	produced.
	
	The Epson products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
