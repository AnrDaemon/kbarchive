	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Flight timing gates may be added to form race courses in Microsoft Flight
	Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer version 4.00. The following rules are
	applied when the score is determined:
	
	Air Race Rules
	--------------
	
	1. The race begins after passing through start gate.
	
	2. The race ends after passing through the finish gate.
	
	3. If the middle gates are missed, the race continues. You can miss any number
	  of middle gates, but doing so will decrease your score.
	
	Scoring:
	
	1. 1-20 point bonus based on how close to the center of the gate the plane
	  passes for each gate
	
	2. Additional bonus points based on speed, determined by the following formula:
	
	  (speed in knots) * (# of gates passed through) / 4
	
	3. Additional 25 bonus points per gate if you pass through every gate
	
	MORE INFORMATION
