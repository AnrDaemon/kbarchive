	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	According to Packard-Bell technical support, any Genius Mouse being used on any
	Packard-Bell machine should be set up for Microsoft Windows 3.0 as a "Mouse
	Systems (or VisiOn mouse) on COMx" where x is either 1 or 2.
	
	If it is not set up correctly, the mouse is unlikely to function properly.
	Pointer movement may be erratic or a pointer may be present but it will not move
	at all.
