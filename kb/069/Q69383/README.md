	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When used under Windows 3.0 on a high-resolution display (800 x 600 and up), or
	with a font-scaling technology such as Adobe Type Manager or FaceLift,
	CorelDRAW! version 2.0 may choose fonts for some functions that are difficult to
	read.
	
	In particular, CorelDRAW! may choose awkward fonts for its ruler numbers and for
	thumbnail titles in its Mosaic utility program.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is due to interaction between CorelDRAWS!'s font requests and the
	activity of the Windows 3.0 font mapping engine.
	
	Corel Corporation is aware of the problem and plans to correct it in a future
	revision.
