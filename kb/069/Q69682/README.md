	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start your Dell System 200, 220, 300, 310, or 325, you receive an error
	message stating that the system was unable to install the A20 handler and that
	HIMEM.SYS could not be loaded.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	According to Dell technical support, the Dell 200, 220, 300, 310, and 325 have
	trouble getting into standard or enhanced mode if they have a keyboard
	controller version B47 or earlier.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You need to contact Dell technical support and obtain an upgrade to the latest
	keyboard controller version B56, which correctly deals with the A20 handler.
	Dell keyboard controller versions B50 through B56 work properly with Windows 3.0
	in standard or enhanced mode.
