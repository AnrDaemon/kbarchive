	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	According to Paradise, when a third-party piggyback card is connected to the
	feature connector on the Paradise Professional video adapter card, VGA modes are
	disabled and are no longer available for use under Microsoft Windows version
	3.0.
	
	The piggyback cards change the timing signals of the VGA section of the card so
	that the VGA is changed to a higher resolution than 640 x 480. These cards do
	not affect the CGA- and EGA-compatible modes, so they are still available and
	work the same.
