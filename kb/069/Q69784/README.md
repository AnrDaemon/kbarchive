	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Flight Simulator requires that SubLogic scenery disks be loaded from
	drive A. For example, if your scenery disk is 3.5 inch and your computer's 3.5
	inch drive is drive B, Flight Simulator will not be able to read the disk.
	
	If a hard drive is available, SubLogic scenery may be copied to the hard drive
	using the CONVERTS utility provided with Flight Simulator.
	
	For dual floppy systems, contact SubLogic Corporation at (800) 637-4983 to
	exchange the disk for the appropriate size.
