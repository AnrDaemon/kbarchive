	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The data formats for ANN and HLP files used by the Microsoft Windows Help
	application are under development and are not expected to remain constant in
	future versions of Windows Help. To avoid problems with different versions of
	these files, Microsoft has decided not to publish either file format.
	
	Currently, the Microsoft Windows Help Compiler, distributed with versions 3.0 and
	3.1 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) and with other
	Microsoft applications that produce HLP files, is the only tool available to
	generate files compatible with the Windows Help system.
