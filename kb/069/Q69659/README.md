	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN cannot be used to print a graphics display screen with a
	laser printer using the MS-DOS Graphics command in version 4.0. However,
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) does provide a utility called HPSCREEN that supports screen
	dumps from HP Vectra, IBM PC/XT/AT/PS2, and 100-percent Vectra compatibles. The
	following display adapters and printers are supported:
