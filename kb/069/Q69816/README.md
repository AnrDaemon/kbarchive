	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The BRAKES indicator appear stuck on, as though the brakes are being
	continuously applied, when you are using a joystick. This symptom indicates that
	Flight Simulator is receiving an "on" signal from the game card (as if one of
	the joystick buttons is being depressed).
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If brakes are always on there may be a problem with the game card, such as a
	faulty chip. If you experience this problem, contact the game card
	manufacturer.
	
	Disable and unplug the joystick.
