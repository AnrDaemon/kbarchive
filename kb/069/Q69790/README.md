	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Flight Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer version 4.00, the
	EICAS portion of the 747 panel contains several different screens. Features
	displayed in the EICAS portion, such as the COM radio, cannot be controlled with
	the mouse. The program is not able to detect which screen is displayed to
	process mouse pointing and movement. All functionality and features are still
	available through menus and the usual keyboard controls.
