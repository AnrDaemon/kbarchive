	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Fuel gauge settings are not saved when a flight mode is created in Flight
	Simulator 4.00. When a mode is loaded or reset, both tanks will be full.
	
	In Flight Simulator version 3.00, the fuel settings are saved properly.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
