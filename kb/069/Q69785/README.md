	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When Option C (RGB monitor CGA) is chosen for the display adapter, land appears
	blue at the San Diego airport. The visibility is poor and it may be difficult to
	see the runway. Land in other airport locations is properly displayed in gray.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
