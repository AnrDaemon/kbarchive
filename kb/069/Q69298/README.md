	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to print from a standard LPTx or COMx port setting to a
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) plotter with a HP-IB interface , printing fails with no
	error message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) plotters are shipped with one of two interfaces, either a
	standard RS-232C or the HP-IB proprietary device interface based on the IEEE-488
	standard.
	
	The HP-IB interface is not supported by Microsoft Windows 3.0.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Print to the LPT1.OS2 port.
