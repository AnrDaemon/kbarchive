	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Download Center contains a file named MOVECC, which demonstrates
	how to simulate the Drag and Drop interface for custom controls. By using the
	MoveWindow() function, this sample allows you to click on a control and drag it
	to a new location.
	
	MOVECC also demonstrates how to manipulate child window Z-order to prevent
	windows from going behind other child windows, and to avoid children painting on
	other children.
