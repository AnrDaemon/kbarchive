	If PROGMAN.EXE is started from the RUN= line in the WIN.INI file and
	appears in the SHELL= line in the SYSTEM.INI file, Program Manager
	always comes up minimized when Windows is run, regardless of the
	state it was in when Windows changes were saved on exit.
	
	If MS-DOS or Windows applications are executed from the RUN= line in
	the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI file, the Program Manager is minimized
	also.
	
	PROGMAN.EXE is not automatically minimized if it is started from the LOAD=
	line in the WIN.INI.
