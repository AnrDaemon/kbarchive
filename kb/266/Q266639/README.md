## Q266639: XCLI: Outlook Tasks Don't Send Updates upon Completion

{% raw %}

	Article: Q266639
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 5.5 SP3
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you assign a task to a user on another Exchange Server computer and select
	only the "Send me a status report when this task is complete" option, you may
	not receive an update when the task is completed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue can occur because the list of recipients that receive the status
	report is stored in the Bcc field of the task. Therefore, when the client
	requests the list, the client receives an empty list and cannot locate the
	recipient.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
	For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base:

	NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
	databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
	been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
	server, but only if it is version 5.5.2652.68 or later. If you restore a
	Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2652.68 after the database has been
	upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional

	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, only assign one task for each user at any given time.
	Use two separate tasks if two users both need to complete the task.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
	Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
	Pack 4.
