	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A white paper is available that describes the functions of the Exchange Server
	Performance Optimizer. At the end of every Exchange Server installation, you are
	prompted to run the Performance Optimizer. Running the Performance Optimizer
	should not be considered optional. The Performance Optimizer does much more than
	minor fine tuning of Exchange Server performance.
