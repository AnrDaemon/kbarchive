	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you do not enter the phone number in Phone Dialer the correct way, you cannot
	use the Dialing Properties. For example, when you make an incorrect entry in
	Phone Dialer, you do not receive the prefix for access to an outside line and
	calling card. This article describes how to enter phone numbers in Phone Dialer
	correctly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Many Windows-based programs that include dialing functions have separate fields
	for the country code, the local area code and the phone number. For example,
	Dial-Up Networking connections include this functionality. However, Phone Dialer
	has only one field to enter the complete phone number.
	
	If you type your phone number in this single field, Phone Dialer uses the phone
	number as it as entered. This means that all of your dialing rules such as the
	prefix for access to an outside line and so on are ignored.
	
	To be able to use the dialing rules you set in the Modems tool in Control Panel,
	you must enter the phone number in Phone Dialer in the international dialing
	format beginning with a plus character as part of the country code and having
	the local area code in parentheses (). For example:
	
	+<country code> (<local area code>) <phone number>
	
	The complete entry would appear like this:
	
	+49 (89) 123456
	
	When you use this format, Phone Dialer uses the dialing rules you set in the
	Modems tool in Control Panel.
