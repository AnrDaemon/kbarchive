	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Microsoft Encarta Researcher in any of the programs listed at
	the beginning of this article to save a new project, you may receive the
	following message:
	
	  <drive>:\My Documents\<filename>.txt already exists.
	  Do you want to replace it?
	
	NOTE: If you click Yes, the <filename>.txt file is not replaced. Encarta
	Researcher creates a file named <filename>.txt.erp, where <filename>
	is the name of the file that you are saving.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you save an Encarta Researcher project with a name
	that is identical to the name of a text (.txt) file that is located in the My
	Documents folder.
	
	NOTE: By default, the Encarta Researcher saves project files in the My Documents
	folder.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, click Yes to save the file with the current file name and
	an Encarta Researcher Project (.erp) extension, or click No, to save the file
	with a different file name.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
	are listed at the beginning of this article.
