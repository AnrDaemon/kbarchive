	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	On Friday March 26, 1999, several corporate networks across the world were
	stricken with a Microsoft Word macro virus referred to as "Melissa." Because of
	its unusual ability to propagate itself through electronic mail, the virus
	forced companies to disable portions of their e-mail systems to prevent further
	propagation both within and outside of their firms. Besides self-propagation,
	the virus sent inappropriate e-mail to addresses that it found in personal
	address books on Microsoft Outlook mail clients. A similar subsequent virus
	recently targeted data destruction.
