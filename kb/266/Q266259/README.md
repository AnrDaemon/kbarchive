	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use multiple MAPI applications to open a message in the information
	store, and then make changes to an attachment (such as deleting the attachment),
	the properties for the attachment may not be saved correctly. For example, if an
	antivirus program deletes the attachment and a secondary MAPI application gains
	access to the message at the same time, the attachment icon is not removed, even
	though the attachment is deleted.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
