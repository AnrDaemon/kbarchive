	CAUSE
	=====
	
	MSN Explorer does not find the current versions of Micrsoft Internet Explorer or
	DirectX on your computer. The above messages will appear every time MSN Explorer
	freezes and logs you out of an online session.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you already have the latest Internet Explorer version 5.5 or greater, or the
	latest DirectX version, bypass the error message by closing out the message
	screen. The MSN Explorer homepage should appear after that.
