	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Netscape Navigator browser included with Netscape Communicator version 4.7
	does not display the contents of a message body if the message is sent from a
	computer running Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 3.

	not match. As a result, the Netscape Navigator browser included with Netscape
	Communicator version 4.7 doesn't display the message body.
