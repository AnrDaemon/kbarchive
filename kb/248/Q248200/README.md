	The information in this article applies to:

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you fly in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, you may experience the
	following symptoms:
	
	- You are unable to see the landing lights from the cockpit.
	
	- You are able to see the landing lights from one of the external views.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the internal view of the landing lights is not
	available in Flight Simulator 2000.
	
	Though available in earlier versions of Flight Simulator, this feature has been
	removed from Flight Simulator 2000 to reduce the number of objects that need to
	be rendered and to improve the performance of the program.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
