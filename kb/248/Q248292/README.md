## Q248292: XCLN: Forwarded or Replied Banner on a Message May Be Incorrect

	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you use Outlook 97, Outlook 98, or Outlook 2000, when you reply to or forward
	a message in the Inbox, a banner is added to the original message that indicates
	you replied to or forwarded the message. However, this time and date banner on
	the message may not reflect the actual date and time that you replied to or
	forwarded the message.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you reply to or forward a message, if you set some send options for the
	message (for example, on the File menu, click Properties, click Send Options,
	click the Microsoft Exchange Server tab, and then under "Send this item", click
	In and type a number of minutes to delay the message), Outlook automatically
	adds the appropriate banner to the original message. However, Outlook flags the
	message before you actually reply to or forward the message. If you decide to
	end the process, this date-and-time banner is not removed. This gives you the
	erroneous impression that you replied to or forwarded the message, even though
	you didn't finish the operation.
