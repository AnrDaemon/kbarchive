	Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
	posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
	servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.
	
	NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
	databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
	been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
	server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
	Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the database has been
	upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
