	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to play one of the Microsoft games listed above, you may receive an
	error message that indicates one of the following files were not found:
	
	  Ddraw.dll, Dinput.dll, Dsound.dll, or D3dim.dll
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the version of Microsoft DirectX required by the
	game, or later, is not properly installed on the computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you have a newly published game, the latest version of DirectX available at
	the time of publishing is included with the game. To install this version:
	
	1. Insert the game CD into the drive. If the game has more than one CD, insert
	  the first CD or CD1.
	
	2. If the game runs automatically, cancel or exit the window.
	
	3. Double-click My Computer, right-click the game CD icon, and then select
	  Install DirectX.
	
	If after installing DirectX you still have the missing file error or do not have
	the option to install DirectX from the CD, please download and install the
	latest version of Microsoft DirectX from the following Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/downloads/default.asp
