	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 1100 printer attached to a port on
	a server running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 with a shared queue, clients
	running Microsoft Windows 98 may not be able to print to this printer. The print
	jobs appear in the queue, and a message states that the job is printed, but no
	output appears at the printer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur when the driver for an HP LaserJet 5L printer is not
	installed at both the Windows NT-based server and the Windows 98-based client.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this behavior, install the driver for an HP LaserJet 5L printer on
	both the Windows NT-based server and the Windows 98-based client computer.
