	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Ancient Lands index always comes up on the letter A, instead of returning to
	the letter you viewed most recently. This behavior is by design. To view a
	different index screen, choose the letter you want, or use the right and left
	arrow buttons.
	
	Choosing the Back button takes you through the main screens you viewed last. If
	you choose the Back button a sufficient number of times, Ancient Lands will
	return to the index screen you viewed previously.
