	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Microsoft Office version 4.2 from Windows NT Advanced Server
	version 3.1 to a Windows NT workstation with the Workstation Setup option, the
	output of fonts and dialog boxes for Word for Windows version 6.0 may appear
	incorrectly. For example, Word for Windows may not display any fonts, and dialog
	boxes may exceed the boundaries of the screen. The output of other applications
	in Microsoft Office display correctly.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	A temporary workaround for this problem is to delete the current user profile.
	However, this behavior may occur again after a short period of time.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
	Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT version
	3.5.
