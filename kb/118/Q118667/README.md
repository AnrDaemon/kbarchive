	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Ancient Lands for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are in a guided tour, some sections of the guide's narration may be
	omitted. That is, when you switch to the next screen of a tour, you may find
	that no narration plays. This may occur if you clicked the guide's button to
	continue the tour just before the random audio for the previous screen was about
	to play.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Ancient Lands version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you miss the narration for a screen, you can choose the Back button and then
	choose the guide's button again to return to the screen. This should cause the
	missed section of narration to play correctly.
