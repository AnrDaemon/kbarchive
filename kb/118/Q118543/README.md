## Q118543: Dangerous Creatures: Hot Spots No Longer Hot When You Return

	Article: Q118543
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbbuglist

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are in a guided tour, you may find that some hot spots are no longer
	hot when you return to them.
	
	NOTE: A hot spot is colored text (jump text) that when clicked with your mouse
	moves you to a related topic. A hot spot can also be a specific part of the
	program that when the mouse cursor is laying over the top of an element
	(typically resembling a small hand) the program plays a sound, opens a menu, or
	moves to another part of the program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dangerous Creatures version 1.0.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. From the Main screen, choose Guides.
	
	2. From the Guides screen, choose Male & Female Roles.
	
	3. Proceed through the guided tour until you reach the Lion screen.
	
	4. Choose the Back button. This returns you to the Lioness pop-up (titled "The
	  Huntress").
	
	5. Click the Lion screen, partially visible behind the Lioness pop-up.
	
	Dangerous Creatures returns to the Lion screen, but the text "Make mine meat" is
	no longer a hot spot. If you pass the mouse pointer over the former hot spot, it
	does not turn into a hand icon. If you click on it, nothing happens. This
	problem also occurs in other guided tours.
