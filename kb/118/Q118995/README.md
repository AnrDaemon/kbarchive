	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you try to view information about Paul Sorrento's 1989 statistics, the
	following error message displays:
	
	  File "mv.m11" bad or missing. Click OK to continue, or click Cancel to close
	  Complete Baseball.
	
	If you click OK, Complete Baseball returns to Paul Sorrento, and shows 1989 as
	the year. However the information will be the same as 1990.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Paul Sorrento's rookie year was 1990. There should not be an option to look at
	1989.
