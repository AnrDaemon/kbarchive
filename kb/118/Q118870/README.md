	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install the Sejin J-Mouse Keyboard drivers and restart the system,
	your mouse no longer functions. The keyboard functions normally; however, the
	enhanced features of the J-Mouse are not active.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The version 4.0 drivers for the J-Mouse features of the Sejin J.M. Keyboard are
	not compatible with Windows 95.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	At this time, no resolution for this problem is available. Sejin is aware of the
	problem and is currently working on drivers that will be compatible with Windows
	95.
	
	Windows 95 includes a MouseKeys feature that allows users to perform mouse
	actions using the numeric keypad. You can enable these features by pressing the
	keyboard combination ALT+SHIFT+NUM LOCK. For more information about MouseKeys,
	refer to Help.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The J-Mouse Keyboard has mouse capabilities built into the "J" key to enable
	mouse movement from the keyboard. There are several other keys with mouse
	functions assigned to them. These keys are designed to shorten the transition
	time between the mouse and the keyboard. They also assist individuals with
	movement disabilities, much the same as the accessibility features of Windows
	95.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by Sejin America, a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	these products' performance or reliability.
