	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, versions 2.1, 3.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Versions 2.1 and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail to X.400 Gateway strip the header
	information from return receipts generated by Microsoft Mail for Windows.
	
	The MS-DOS client for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks puts the receipt information
	in the body of the message, so it is not lost when the gateway strips the
	header. The Windows client, however, puts receipt information in the message
	header, so it is lost when the header is stripped by the gateway, and the
	recipient gets a blank message with the boilerplate subject.
	
	Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail to X.400 Gateway checks the header of each message
	to see if it is a Windows client receipt and, if it is, includes the header
	(with receipt information) in the outgoing message.
	
	Receipts from the MS-DOS and Windows clients look different, but both contain all
	essential information.
