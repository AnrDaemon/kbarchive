	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows 95 does not recognize your machine as a Plug and Play computer even
	though you receive a message during startup that states:
	
	  Intel PnP BIOS Extensions Installed
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Intel has developed some motherboards that are equipped with a Plug and Play
	BIOS that does not contain the run-time services necessary to configure
	motherboard devices.
	
	An example of such a motherboard is the Intel P5/90. Gateway, and possibly other
	original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), ship computers with the P5/90
	motherboard.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Consult your hardware vendor about upgrading your system BIOS to comply with the
	Plug and Play BIOS version 1.0a specification.
