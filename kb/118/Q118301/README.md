	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The information found in the "Creator File Types" topic in the online Help files
	incorrectly refers to "Creator File Types."
	
	Creators and file types are actually two different components of a file within
	the Macintosh operating system.
	
	For example, the column headings in the table in the Help file should read as
	follows:
	
	  File Type          FoxPro Files          File Extension
	  -------------------------------------------------------
	
	  F+DB               Table                 .DBF
