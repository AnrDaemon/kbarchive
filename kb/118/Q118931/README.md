	Article: Q118931
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Kids Products

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print to a STAR NX 2420 Rainbow printer, solid-color fills in spletters
	print correctly. (Spletters are word shapes created using the Word Shape tool.
	This is similar to WordArt in other Microsoft applications.) However, if you
	apply a pattern to the fill, the letter outlines print, but there is no color or
	pattern. Letters appear transparent so that an applied shadow will show through
	the letters when printed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs using the STAR driver version 1.2, or an Epson LQ-860
	emulation using driver version 2.11. There is no known resolution to this
	problem.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer version 1.0, 1.1
	and 1.1a for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	Pattern-filled spletters print properly from Microsoft Fine Artist to the STAR NX
	2420 Rainbow. Pattern-filled WordArt objects print correctly from other
	Microsoft applications to the STAR NX 2420 Rainbow.
