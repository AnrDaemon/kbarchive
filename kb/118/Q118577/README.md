	- Microsoft Windows 95

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Windows 95, when you start a tutorial in a Lotus Development product, the
	color of the taskbar changes to blue. The colors for other objects (such as
	dialog boxes) also change.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Tutorials that accompany some Lotus Development programs change the system
	colors in Windows when you start them.
	
	This behavior has been observed in the Quick Start tutorial of Lotus Freelance
	for Windows.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior also occurs in Microsoft Windows 3.x and Windows for Workgroups
	3.x; however, the changes are not as obvious because previous versions of
	Windows do not update all user interface elements when the colors are changed.
	Windows 95 consistently updates these user interface elements, making these
	changes more apparent.
