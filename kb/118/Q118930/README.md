	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you compose a message in Microsoft Mail for Windows, a send note becomes a
	read note after you move it to a shared folder.
	
	This is part of the design of Mail; everything in a shared folder has a read note
	status. There is no attempt to distinguish send notes from read notes, either by
	ownership or by the fact that it has not been sent.
