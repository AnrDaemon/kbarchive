	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Changing the imaging options (such as, "Print as a Negative Image," "Print as a
	Mirror Image," and "Compress Bitmap Images") through the PostScript printer
	driver does not work properly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Some applications bypass the PostScript printer driver and download their own
	information to the printer.
	
	NOTE: Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows and CorelDRAW are known to do this.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Rather than setting these options through the printer driver, set them through
	the application.
