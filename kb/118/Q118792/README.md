	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Help button overlaps the Close button on the far-right side of the title
	bar.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by a design conflict between the application and Windows
	95. The Help button still activates Help when you click it. The Close button
	also still functions if any portion of it is visible and can be clicked.
	
	The following applications exhibit this problem:
	
	  Application          Manufacturer
	  -----------          ------------
	
	  AmiPro               Lotus Development Corporation
	  Freelance            Lotus Development Corporation
	  Harvard Graphics     Harvard Graphics
	  PageMaker            Adobe Corporation
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	At this time, no resolution is available; however, there are several alternative
	ways to close an active window:
	
	- Press the ALT+F4 key combination.
	
	- Use the right mouse button to click anywhere on the title bar and then click
	  Close.
	
	- Click the Control Menu icon at the far left of the title bar and then click
	  Close.
