	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article provides information about how to capture a palette from an AVI
	file. Microsoft Video for Windows allows palettes to be stored inside each AVI
	file; this allows for a unique palette in each AVI file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Video for Windows version 1.0 ships with a program called PalEdit. This
	application is used to view, modify, and capture palettes. A palette can also be
	captured in VidCap and VidEdit, but it cannot be modified in those tools.
	PalEdit can be used to capture palettes by simply loading the AVI file (choose
	Open from the File menu). In other applications, the palette must be copied to
	the Clipboard and then pasted into PalEdit.
	
	NOTE: PalEdit is not included in Video for Windows 1.1. However, if you upgraded
	from version 1.0, PalEdit is still available. Neither version of Video for
	Windows is sold through retail locations. It is sometimes sold with capture
	boards as an OEM product.
