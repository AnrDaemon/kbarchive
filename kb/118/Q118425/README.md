	- Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you eject the Dangerous Creatures CD while a movie is playing, you may
	receive a "Stack Overflow" error message. This usually occurs after you have
	received several "Cannot Find Data" error messages and chosen Cancel several
	times.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dangerous Creatures version 1.0.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, do not remove the Dangerous Creatures CD while the
	program is running. It is never a good idea to remove any disk or CD while your
	computer is reading it.
	
	For more information, refer to the Dangerous Creatures readme file.
