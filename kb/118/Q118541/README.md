	- Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Dangerous Creatures may not print correctly to the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet
	500 printer if you select the faster (lower quality) print option. The printout
	may extend slightly beyond the usable area of the page, and a narrow line may
	appear on the left edge of the second sheet of paper.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, print using the slower (and higher quality) print option.
	The HP DeskJetC series driver version 4.0 (for all DeskJet models from 500 to
	560C) also corrects this problem, but does not provide the option to print in
	low resolution in graphics mode.
