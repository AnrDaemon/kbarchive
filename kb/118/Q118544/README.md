	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you run Dangerous Creatures from Squeegee (instead of from Program Manager or
	the Windows 95 desktop) a general protection (GP) fault may occur. Under Windows
	95, the initial error dialog reads
	
	  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
	
	This happens if you choose Back while in any Dangerous Creatures game. This
	problem occurs because Squeegee is not compatible with Dangerous Creatures.
