	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Word Count feature (on the Tools menu, click Word Count) to
	count the number of pages, words, characters, paragraphs, or lines in a
	selection of text in a Word document, the "Include footnotes and endnotes" check
	box is not available, and Word cannot include the text of your footnotes and
	endnotes in the count.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Microsoft has available a Selection Word Count macro that counts the words in
	the selected text. The macro also counts the words in footnotes and endnotes for
	the selected text that contains footnote or endnote references. For additional
	information about the Word Count macro, click the article number below to view
