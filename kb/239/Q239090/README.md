	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When a message is forwarded by the Forward Intact rule in the Microsoft Exchange
	Server 5.0 client or by the Redirect rule in Outlook 2000, it may be logged as a
	Send As event in the event viewer application log on the Exchange Server
	computer even though the user does not have Send As permission on the mailbox.
	This may cause confusion for administrators.
