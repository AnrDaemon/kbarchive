	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	For the DD.EXE device driver portion of LapLink to be compatible with MS-DOS
	5.0, you must use LapLink version 3.0a (with DD.EXE version 3.0a).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The DD.EXE driver allows drives on remote computers to be remapped as local
	logical drives. When an older version of this driver is used (for example,
	version 1.35[a]), the machine will lock up. The version of the driver can be
	determined by its copyright message or by the driver's creation date; old
	drivers will have dates earlier than 1990.
	
	According to Traveling Software, LapLink version 3.0, except for this driver, is
	compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these product's performance
	or reliability.
