	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh version 4.0 slew mode, you
	can use the number keys on the numeric key pad as directional keys for the
	aircraft. For example, pressing the number 8 key moves the plane forward.
	However, if you select either the "1 Joystick" or "2 Joysticks" option in
	Preferences, slew mode operates very slowly.
	
	This problem occurs because the joystick and the keyboard are competing for
	control of the system. The only way to avoid the problem and achieve faster
	slewing is to turn the joystick option off.
