	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When printing in Windows 3.0 to a Toshiba P351 24-pin printer, the printer
	automatically switches from HS (draft) mode to letter-quality mode just before
	it begins to print. This occurs in any Windows-based application.

	According to Toshiba printer support, this was a known problem with the Toshiba
	24-pin driver currently included with Windows 3.0.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Toshiba and Microsoft have confirmed this to be a problem in the Toshiba P351
	printer driver for Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a. This problem was corrected and
	does not occur in later versions.
	
	Options for printing 180 x 180 resolution and 360 x 180 resolution are part of
	the new driver.
