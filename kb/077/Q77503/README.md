	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The "Microsoft Windows 3.0 Class-In-A-Box Student Workbook" comes with several
	practice files that can be installed into a user-specified directory. These
	files are data files that are opened through various applications, as indicated
	in the workbook.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To install the files to a directory on the hard drive or onto another floppy
	disk in the system, do the following:
	
	1. Insert the original floppy disk into drive A. (Note that drive A must be used
	  because the installation batch file makes no provisions for other drives to
	  be used.)
	
	2. Change to the directory where you would like the files to be copied. For
	  example, type
	
	  cd\tutorial
	
	  to change the TUTORIAL directory.
	
	3. Type
	
	  a:class
	
	  and press ENTER. The file CLASS.BAT will then be executed, and the data files
	  will be copied to the destination directory.
