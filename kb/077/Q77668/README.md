	form on the original disks. These files are decompressed and copied to a user's
	workstation during the download procedure.
	
	The following is a list of the Windows Libraries for OS/2 (WLO) files copied
	during installation. Note that the names shown are the decompressed versions of
	the files. The compressed versions of these files contain an at sign (@) as the
