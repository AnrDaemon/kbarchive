	  **************************************
	  Microsoft Flight Simulator version 4.0
	             Release Notes
	  **************************************
	
	Please note the following additions to Microsoft Flight Simulator for
	the Macintosh version 4.0 and its documentation. You can print this
	document for convenient reference.
	
	Rebuild your desktop after installing Flight Simulator
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	It is recommended that you rebuild your desktop after you have
	installed Flight Simulator on your machine by holding down the OPTION
	and COMMAND keys while starting your Macintosh. Warning: If you
	rebuild your desktop, you lose any Finder comments you previously
	created, so record those comments for later re-entry if needed.
	
	Application memory recommendations for using Flight Simulator
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Flight Simulator contains many features and multiple windows to view
	your flying experience. Each of these features and views require
	memory to function, and if your system has a large monitor and/or
	ability to display many colors, the memory demands on Flight Simulator
	are high. If you are using Flight Simulator and begin to see alert
	messages that say memory is low, it is recommended that you allocate
	more memory for Flight Simulator by using the following steps:
	
	1. Highlight the Microsoft Flight Simulator icon, and choose Get Info
	  from the Finder's File menu. De-select the Lock check box to unlock
	  the file.
	
	2. Increase the Application Memory Size from 750K to 1024K, or 2048K
	  if your system has the memory available. Close the Get Info window.
	
	The general guideline is that Flight Simulator operates with fewer
	constraints when memory has been increased, especially with systems
	that have ability to display many colors (for example, 24- bit video
	boards).
	
	Using mouse replacement-type joysticks with Flight Simulator
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Flight Simulator's joystick control mode is designed to operate with
	joysticks that plug into the ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) and have driver
	programs associated with them (the Advanced Gravis joystick, for
	example). The Joystick dialog box and controls control these sticks.
	Some brands of joysticks are designed to be mouse replacements, and
	are thus indistinguishable from a mouse to the Flight Simulator
	program. These joysticks can be used quite nicely by choosing Mouse As
	Yoke aircraft control mode from the Edit menu. Follow these guidelines
	when using these types of joysticks:
	
	1. Put the joystick into an absolute position mode. In this mode, the
	  pointer should always come back to the same spot on the screen when
	  you center the joystick.
	
	2. Press COMMAND+M to enter Mouse As Yoke aircraft control mode. (The
	  mouse *and* joystick now control the yoke.)
	
	3. The best setup is to use the joystick for typical yoke control
	  functions only (such as aileron and elevator). Use the mouse (with
	  button down) for throttle and brakes. Pressing the joystick button and
	  using it for throttle leaves the stick in an off-center position when
	  you release the button and go back to elevators. It's best not to use
	  the joystick throttle.
	
	4. Make sensitivity adjustments from the Mouse dialog box, not the
	  Joystick dialog box. Set Null Zone to full narrow (setting 1).
	  Sensitivity for many joysticks (especially IBM PC-based sticks that
	  have been converted for use with the Macintosh) should be set to
	  maximum.
	
	5. Choose the Control Panel from the Apple menu, and select the mouse
	  icon for adjustment. Set tracking to TABLET mode (very slow). This
	  helps center any "drift" problems.
	
	6. The mouse (and thus the joystick) have different sensitivities at
	  different airspeeds, so if you move the stick far left at one airspeed
	  and center it at another airspeed, ailerons may not return to center.
	  This is unnoticeable on a mouse, but quite noticeable on the joystick.
	  The following steps can be used to keep your ailerons centered:
	
	   a. Press 5 on the keypad.
	
	   b. Make a trim adjustment on your joystick.
	
	   c. Move the mouse to the left or right (this makes a good trim
	      adjustment on joysticks without trim adjustments).
	
	Using Flight Simulator with macro recorders
	-------------------------------------------
	
	If you use a macro recorder like AutoMac or QuickKeys, and want to use
	it to record a flight session in Flight Simulator, avoid using Mouse
	As Yoke mode for controlling the aircraft. When Flight Simulator uses
	the mouse to control the aircraft, it hides the mouse pointer, which
	can cause conflicts with macro recorders that depend on the position
	of the pointer to operate properly. The airplane can still be
	controlled by using the keyboard controls, as explained in the
	Keyboard Summary of the User's Guide.
	
	Using Flight Simulator with French or German keyboards
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	To operate the aircraft's flaps with keyboards that do not have
	function keys, use the following keys to raise or lower the flaps:
	
	                             French      German
	                             ------      ------
	
	Raise flaps:                    ^            \334
	
	Lower flaps:                    $            #
	
	The COMMAND+1, COMMAND+2, and COMMAND+3 keyboard assignments for
	selecting either View1, View2, or Map View with the keyboard do not
	function while using the French keyboard. French keyboard users must
	use the mouse to select the active window by either clicking the
	window, or choosing the window's name from the Window menu.
	
	The Microsoft Flight Simulator team hopes you enjoy this version of
	Flight Simulator, and that you find it is worth the wait!
