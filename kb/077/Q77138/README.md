	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.1 and 5.1a can generate
	line-number information for its listing files that correlates with the
	cross-reference listing file generated by the CREF utility.
	
	With the release of MASM version 6.0, line-number information has been taken out
	because of the addition of the new Source Browser.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To generate an assembler listing and a cross-reference listing with MASM version
	5.1a, enter the following commands at the DOS or OS/2 prompt:
	
	  " masm /c /l /Zd test.asm;
	  cref test.crf; " (without the quotation marks)
	
	To generate Source Browser information in version 6.0, do the following:
	
	1. Choose Browse Options from the Options menu. Then choose "Generate Browse
	  Information."
	
	2. Create a program list for the file being generated.
	
	3. Choose Rebuild All from the Make menu.
	
	Once the build is completed, browse information will be generated (if no errors
	occurred during assemble or link time) and can be accessed through the Browse
	menu.
