	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Alien Computing FaxIt! version 2.0c or earlier may not work correctly under
	MS-DOS version 5.0. However, FaxIt! versions 2.0d and later are compatible with
	MS-DOS 5.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Problems may occur when there is a combination of MS-DOS 5.0, Windows 3.0, and
	an earlier version of FaxIt!. The earlier versions of the FaxIt! scheduler do
	not work properly with MS-DOS 5.0 and will keep Windows 3.0 from booting. If you
	try to start Windows, the machine will return you to the DOS prompt instead of
	starting Windows.
	
	If you have FaxIt! version 2.0c or earlier and are experiencing conflicts with
	MS-DOS 5.0, contact Alien Computing for a free upgrade.
