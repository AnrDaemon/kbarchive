	Generic Software has confirmed that running Generic CADD Level 3 Revision 4 from
	MS-DOS version 5.0 Shell may result in missing or garbled characters when you
	load or print drawings.
	
	Generic Software does not recommend running Generic CADD with any other
	memory-resident software or from MS-DOS Shell.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Generic Software recommends running Generic CADD directly from the command
	prompt. Generic Software also recommends that no memory-resident software be
	active when executing Generic CADD, including MS-DOS Shell.
	
	Executing Generic CADD with memory resident software may result in incomplete
	drawings or unnecessary characters when you load a file to print or view from
	the screen.
	
	Generic CADD requires 585K of conventional memory to run. To invoke Generic CADD
	from the command prompt, type "cadd" (without the quotation marks) from the CADD
	subdirectory.
