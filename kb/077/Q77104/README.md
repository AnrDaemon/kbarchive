	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the use of the autodisconnect feature
	included in network software can cause problems with the connection between the
	workstation client software and the Mail database.
	
	Autodisconnect lets you set a time limit for inactive sessions between the
	workstation and the server on a network. If the Mail server is disconnected from
	a Microsoft Mail workstation client, mail cannot be sent.
	
	The Autodisconnect feature is available in Microsoft LAN Manager and 3Com 3+Open
	Network software.
