	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Canon BJ-10e, BJ-10ex, BJ-5, and BJ-20 are single-sheet feed, platen-style
	printers. This platen feed feature causes these printers to have a larger than
	average unprintable area at the bottom of the page. As a result, footers, page
	numbers, or any other objects placed too near the bottom of the page may not
	print.
