	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When running Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 and later on a Tandy 1400 laptop, the clock
	will not function properly because of the nonstandard implementation of the
	clock on the Tandy 1400. The clock will be reset each time the computer is
	booted and it won't be incremented while an application is running.

	The Tandy 1400 laptop comes in three models: LT, FD, and HD. On these models,

	machine. The following list describes Tandy 1400 laptop models and corresponding
