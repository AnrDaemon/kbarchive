	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Pages 451 and 459 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0
	incorrectly state that when creating a program information file (PIF) and
	leaving the Window Title text box blank, the icon title, when minimized, will
	contain the application's filename without the extension.
	
	This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you leave the Window Title text box blank while in real, standard, or 386
	enhanced mode, the icon title does not assume the application's filename without
	the extension. Rather, the icon title assumes the name of the application's PIF
	without the .PIF extension.
	
	Note: This also holds true for the title that appears in the Task List when you
	press CTRL+ESC. While the manual is incorrect, the on-screen Help program that
	appears when you place the cursor in the Window Title text box and press F1
	correctly states that the title bar will display the name of the PIF without the
	.PIF extension.
