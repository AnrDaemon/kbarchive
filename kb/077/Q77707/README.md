	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	On machines with a Turbo XT BIOS dated 1980, floppy drives may be unusable under
	MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later because the BIOS does not indicate the floppy
	drive model type properly. In some earlier versions of MS-DOS, the model type
	check is performed incorrectly, so the drives are usable.
