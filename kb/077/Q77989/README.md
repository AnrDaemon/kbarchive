	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Tutorial in Bookshelf for Windows was created with two books: the first is
	the main Tutorial screen and the second is the book that contains all of the
	lessons. By design, the range of a bookmark is limited to one book. As a result,
	although defined bookmarks for the lessons may appear in the bookmark menu of
	the main screen, they cannot access anything beyond that main screen book. To
	access these bookmarks, go to any lesson in the Tutorial and then choose the
	desired bookmark from the menu.
