	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you fly at high altitudes in Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator, the
	aircraft map orientation may be fixed to the north.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, slew at lower altitudes.
	
	NOTE: When you zoom the map view so that you can see the world globe, you slew at
	a very high speed.
	
	When you slew at a very high speed over long distances, it may be difficult to
	slew in the direction that you want when the map orientation is fixed to the
	north.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Combat Flight
	Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.
