	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Cancel and Apply buttons that appear in the collections resource properties
	dialog box are disabled and non-functional.
	
	Additionally, the dialog box contains read-only information. As a result, changes
	cannot be made and the functionality of the Cancel and Apply buttons is not
	needed.
	
	This is by design.
