	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Visual SourceSafe 6.0 includes a new means of implementing multiple databases.
	
	NOTE: You cannot share files between multiple databases. You also cannot merge
	databases.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To add databases in Visual SourceSafe 6.0, click Create Database on the Tools
	menu in the Visual SourceSafe Administrator. This will create a new Visual
	SourceSafe installation tree containing the database and the default
	administrator and guest users who will have access to the database. You can then
	add users to the database.
	Once you've created the database and added users to it, you can open it using the
	Open Database command on the File menu.
