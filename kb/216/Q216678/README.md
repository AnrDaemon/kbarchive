	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Within Windows NT Explorer, after mapping a network drive to a Directory File
	System (Dfs) share, the drive letter for the associated connection does not
	appear in the drive listing. Refreshing the window causes the connection to
	appear in the drive listing.
	
	Also, Dfs mapped drives may fail when setting them to the current drive from a
	command prompt.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the Dfs connection type is not automatically
	refreshed.
