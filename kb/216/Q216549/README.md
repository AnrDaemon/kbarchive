	- Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 99 
	- Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 99 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 99, the playback of the
	introductory audio clip may start and stop intermittently, or may quit before
	the audio clip is finished playing.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if your CD-ROM drive is unable to read the Encarta
	CD-ROM properly.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use the following methods:
	
	Clean the Compact Disc
	----------------------
	
	Clean the compact disc to remove fingerprints, smudges, and dust, any of which
	can cause read problems on compact discs. Gently wipe the silver side of the
	disc with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper cloth, which may
	scratch the plastic or leave streaks.
	
	NOTE: Wipe the compact disc using a linear motion from the center of the disc
	outward. Do not use a circular motion.
	
	After you clean the compact disc, try starting the program again.
	
	Make Sure You Are Using Protected Mode CD-ROM Drivers
	-----------------------------------------------------
	
	Make sure you are using protected mode (32-bit) drivers for your CD-ROM drive. To
	do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click System.
	
	3. Click the Performance tab, and then confirm that the File System entry is
	  32-bit. If the File System entry is "Some drives are using MS-DOS
	  compatibility," you may be using real mode (16-bit) CD-ROM drivers. If this
	  is the case, you may not be able to read certain files on the compact disc.
	
	  Contact the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive to obtain an updated, protected
	  mode driver for your CD-ROM drive.
	
	4. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.
	
	Test the Integrity of the Encarta CD-ROM
	----------------------------------------
	
	Test the integrity of the Encarta CD-ROM. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Right-click an empty area on the desktop, point to New, and then click
	  Folder.
	
	2. Insert the Encarta Encyclopedia 99 Disc 1 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.
	  Press and hold down the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent
	  Encarta Encyclopedia from starting automatically.
	
	3. Double-click My Computer.
	
	4. Right-click the CD-ROM drive icon, and then click Explore.
	
	5. Double-click the Encyc99 folder.
	
	6. Right-click the Dswmedia folder, and then click Copy.
	
	7. Double-click the folder you created in Step A.
	
	8. On the Edit menu, click Paste.
	
	If you receive an error message similar to the following
	
	  The system cannot read from the specified device.
	
	contact Microsoft to obtain a set of replacement discs.
	
	To obtain replacement discs for Encarta Encyclopedia 99 or Encarta Reference
	Suite 99, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and request the
	appropriate CD-ROM set for your copy of Encarta.
	
	If you are outside the United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your
	area. To locate your subsidiary, refer to the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web
	site at the following address:
