	  This program cannot be run in DOS mode.

	inadvertently inserted Microsoft Internet Explorer floppy disk 1.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are two different sets of installation disks included in the Windows 95
	retail release (Upgrade or Full version). One set of disks is for installing
	Windows 95, which can be installed from a command prompt or from within Windows.
	The other set of disks are for installing Internet Explorer, which must be
	installed from within Windows. Both sets of disks have a disk labeled "Disk 1 -
	Setup", so it is important to note the actual product name printed on the left
	side of the disk label.
