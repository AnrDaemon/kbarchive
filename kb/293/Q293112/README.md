	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You may connect to the Internet through MSN Internet Access dial-up service and
	want to access another e-mail account (for example, an account from work) while
	you are connected.
	
	Previously, you could set up additional e-mail accounts in Outlook or Outlook
	Express. However, if you created your MSN account after 12/15/2000, you will not
	be able to send e-mail from an additional account while connected to MSN. You
	can only send email from your MSN e-mail account while connected to MSN.
