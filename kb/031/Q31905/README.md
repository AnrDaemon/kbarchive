	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	It is not necessary to use the CONVERTS program to use the SubLOGIC scenery
	disks with Flight Simulator when running on a two-floppy disk configuration.
	Converted scenery disks will not work correctly with this configuration because
	the CONVERTS program is intended to be used with a hard disk.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following are directions for using Flight Simulator with floppy disks and
	directly loading SubLOGIC scenery disks:
	
	1. Start the Flight Simulator program from Drive B if possible, otherwise you
	  may use Drive A.
	
	2. From the Sim menu (menu 4), turn the Crash Detect field to off.
	
	3. Change the disk in Drive A to the SubLOGIC scenery disk of your choice.
	
	4. Select menu 5, press 2, and then press 1 to load the scenery. A menu will
	  appear displaying available scenery. Press any key to continue.
	
	5. Change to an airport within this scenery by pressing 5A and typing in the
	  coordinates for that airport. The coordinates for scenery disk airports are
	  supplied in the SubLOGIC documentation.
	
	NOTE: If scenery disks have been damaged by running CONVERTS on the floppy disks,
	please contact SubLOGIC for replacements.
