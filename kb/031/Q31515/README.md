	EXT.DOC
	   This file documents each of the low-level editing functions that
	can be called from a Microsoft-Editor C extension.
	   The types COL and LINE, formally declared in the file EXT.H, are
	short and long integers, respectively. A variable of type COL refers
	to a column in a file, and a variable of type LINE refers to a line
	(in other words, a row) in a file. Numbering for both COL and LINE
	variables begins with 0. Therefore, line 0 is the first line in the
	file.
