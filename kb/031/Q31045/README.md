	The Lotus 1-2-3 menu that was included with the original mouse (Word
	2.00 bundle) will not work if Lotus 1-2-3 was loaded from the hard
	disk and you have the bus mouse set for interrupt 5 on your IBM PC.
	The menu runs properly from a floppy.
	
	Change the interrupt setting to 2 on the bus card to resolve this
	problem.
