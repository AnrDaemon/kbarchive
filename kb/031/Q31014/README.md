	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Microsoft Windows on a Kaypro 16-2 portable computer with a
	built-in 9-inch monochrome screen, there appears to be no choice in the Windows
	setup for that screen type.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The Kaypro 16-2 portable runs with Windows if you choose the CGA selection for
	the screen when running setup. Although it is monochrome, the screen emulates
	CGA.
