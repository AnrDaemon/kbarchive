## Q31989: Object Modules Handled by LINK

{% raw %}

	Article: Q31989
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 3.x 5.01.20 5.01.21
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 15-JUL-1988
	
	Successive versions of LINK always are backward compatible, but not
	necessarily upward compatible, i.e., the most recent versions should
	link any existing object module, but not necessarily any future object
	module.
	   To solve this problem, update to the latest version of LINK.
