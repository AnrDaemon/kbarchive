	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you trying to install the DER on a French AppleTalk Server with French
	MacMail, the install screen does not allow input into any field except the Send
	directory Hour field. Because of this, directory replication cannot be set up
	between MacMail and Exchange Server.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
	U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
