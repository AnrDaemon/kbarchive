	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) with the Chat snap-in,
	administrators who have more than one server expanded in the view will be unable
	to save the console settings with all servers expanded.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior is by design as both servers will still be in the saved settings,
	but only the last-used server entry will be expanded.
