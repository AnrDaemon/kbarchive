	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to install Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 99, the installation
	program may not finish successfully, and you may receive an error message
	stating that there is insufficient hard disk space to install the program.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because the Encarta Encyclopedia 99 installation program
	does not check for sufficient hard disk space.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent this issue from occurring, make sure at least 50 megabytes (MB) of
	hard disk space is available on the hard disk on which you want to install
	Encarta Encyclopedia 99 before you install the program.
	
	NOTE: In addition to the 50 MB of hard disk space needed to install Encarta
	Encyclopedia 99, Microsoft recommends you maintain at least 50 MB of available
	space on the hard disk on which Microsoft Windows is installed. This disk space
	is needed by the Windows swap file, but may also be used by other programs.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia
	99.
