	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The map view in Flight Simulator 5.0 may be filled black when you zoom out to
	the global view. To correct this problem, try one of the following resolutions.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	RESOLUTION 1
	------------
	
	This problem occurs when Textured Ground and Aircraft Texture are disabled.
	
	Select Textured Ground or Aircraft Texture from the Display Preferences dialog
	box. As long as at least one of these options is selected, the map view should
	display correctly.
	
	RESOLUTION 2
	------------
	
	This problem also occurs when there is less than 80K of expanded (EMS) memory
	configured on the system.
	
	Expanded memory is required to take advantage of most scenery options in Flight
	Simulator 5.0. The memory must be configured for at least 80K of expanded memory
	or some options may not be available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For more information about how to configure the RAM memory as expanded memory,
	consult the inside back cover of the Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook
	or your MS-DOS or Windows manual.
