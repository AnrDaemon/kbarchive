	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If your monitor is initially set to something other than 256 colors, you may
	find that after you run Art Gallery and restart your Macintosh, the monitor
	resets to 256 shades of gray.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Art Gallery version 1.0 for the
	Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
