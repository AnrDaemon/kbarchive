## Q110324: Writer: Spelling Checker Does Not Recognize All Caps

	Article: Q110324
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Kids Products
	Version(s): 1.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 26-FEB-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Spelling Bee in Creative Writer 1.0 doesn't find misspellings you have typed
	in all capital letters. It also does not find misspellings if the beginning of
	the word is capitalized and not at the beginning of the sentence.
	
	The manner of spell checking was changed in Creative Writer, version 1.1 and 1.1a
	on CD-ROM. Versions 1.1 and 1.1a spell check all words, capitalized or not.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, type your text in lowercase characters first, and then
	check the spelling. After checking the spelling, change to uppercase characters
	the words you want to appear in capital letters.
	
	EXAMPLES
	--------
	
	1. In Creative Writer, enter the Writing Studio. On separate lines, type the
	  following:
	
	  "APLE" (without the quotation marks)
	
	  "aple" (without the quotation marks)
	
	  "Aple" (without the quotation marks)
	
	  "Aple Aple" (without the quotation marks)
	
	2. Choose the Bee on the toolbar.
	
	3. Choose Spell.
	
	4. The Creative Writer spelling checker will find that:
	
	  APLE is not misspelled
	
	  aple is misspelled
	
	  Aple is misspelled
	
	  Aple Aple - the first Aple is misspelled, but not the second.
