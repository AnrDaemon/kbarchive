	- Microsoft Isaac Asimov's The Ultimate Robot for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you run Asimov in 16-color mode, the bullet back button [*<] may not
	display its active mode correctly. This button should turn green to indicate
	when it is active; however, if your monitor is set to 16 colors, the button may
	not change color.
	
	Asimov does not provide full support for 16-color (4-bit) displays.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Asimov's Ultimate Robot version
	1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
