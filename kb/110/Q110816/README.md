	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks to address a
	mail message using the standard addressing window, the right side of the dialog
	box is cut off.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Macintosh Color Classic screen is slightly smaller than that of a Macintosh
	SE by approximately 1/8 inch. Because of this size difference, the addressing
	screen is not displayed in its entirety.
	
	NOTE: This does not affect the function of the dialog box, only the display on
	the Color Classic.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail
	for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
