	- Microsoft Isaac Asimov's The Ultimate Robot for the Macintosh, version 1.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The bullet back button [*<] may not always return you to the appropriate
	dialog box. For example, in the Timeline, if you click a word or phrase, a box
	containing related information appears. If in that box you click another hot
	word or phrase, another box or screen appears. However, if at this point you
	click the bullet back button, you are returned to the Timeline, not to the first
	text box.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Asimov's Ultimate Robot version
	1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
