	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When Units Of Measure is set to Metric(Alt Meters) the altimeter does NOT
	display altitude in meters. (The Units Of Measure option is available by
	clicking Preferences from the Options menu, and clicking Country.)
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When Units Of Measure is set to Metric(Alt Meters), all menus and dialog boxes
	in Flight Simulator 5.0 will show altitude information in meters. For example,
	altitudes for cloud layers will be shown in meters in the Clouds dialog box when
	you click Weather from the World menu.
	
	However, the altimeter always shows altitude in feet. In actual aviation
	situations, altitude is always measured in feet regardless of the unit of
	measurement commonly used in a country.
