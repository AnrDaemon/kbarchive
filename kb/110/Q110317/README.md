	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After an aircraft crashes you may see some screen corruption in the upper-left
	corner of the screen as the situation resets itself.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This does not occur when flying the Cessna Skyline RGR R182. In VGA or SVGA
	resolution, the corruption appears as a patch of brown and white pixels. In EGA
	resolution it is recognizable as a gauge of some kind; however, it does not
	correspond to any actual gauge in any aircraft.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator for MS-DOS,
	version 5.0.
