## Q110194: Kids: HP DeskJet 500/550C Omits Patterns

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft WordArt, version 2.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print Creative Writer and Fine Artist documents, PowerPoint slides, or
	WordArt objects to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) 500 series DeskJet printer, you may
	find that spletters (shape text objects) do not print correctly. The HP DeskJet
	500 series printers omit the patterns in spletters. Patterned spletters are
	printed with solid instead of patterned fills. This problem has also been
	reported on HP4Si printers running with Windows 95.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	Upgrading the printer driver does not resolve the problem; the problem occurs
	with the HP DeskJet driver versions 3.1, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0.
	
	
	NOTE: The Canon BubbleJet 600 and 600e may display the same behavior because the
	BubbleJet 600 and 600e drivers are based on the HP DeskJet driver.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The patterns in spletters print correctly from Creative Writer for the Macintosh
	to HP DeskWriter printers. The DeskWriter series is Hewlett- Packard's
	Macintosh-platform equivalent of the DeskJet series.
