	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Microsoft Works version 2.0 for Windows under Microsoft Windows for
	Workgroups version 3.11, the automatic dialing feature does not work correctly.
	The modem dials the number correctly, the phone begins to ring, Works instructs
	you to pick up the phone and choose Yes; however, when you do this, Works does
	not turn off the modem and transfer the call to the phone. As a result, you hear
	the person you're calling over the modem speaker, not the phone speaker.
	
	This problem does not occur with Works version 3.0 for Windows, nor does it occur
	with the MS-DOS-based versions of Works.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by a conflict between Works 2.0 and the Windows for
	Workgroups 3.11 communication driver (COMM.DRV).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
