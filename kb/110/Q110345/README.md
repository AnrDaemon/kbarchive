	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word for Windows version 2.0 dialog boxes that list filenames, some
	lines will be blank, indicating that files are being listed, but not displayed.
	Also, some letters in words displayed on dialog boxes may be missing.
	
	This behavior is intermittent and occurs when you start Word from a network
	location (not from an installation of Word on the local computer) using an
	account that does not have full privileges. This behavior does not occur when
	you log on from an administrative account.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
	Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
	Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. For
	information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
