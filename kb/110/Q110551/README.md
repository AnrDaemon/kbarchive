	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following article describes the general conventions and behavior for air
	temperature in Flight Simulator 5.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Air temperature in Flight Simulator 5.0 is not affected by season or weather
	conditions such as winds or clouds.
	
	The air temperature is entirely governed by temperature layers established at
	different altitudes by choosing Weather from the World menu and selecting
	Temperature Layers.
	
	Each layer contains information for the base altitude of the temperature layer
	and the daytime temperature of the layer. Temperatures increase or decrease
	proportionately as the aircraft ascends or descends based on the distance
	between layers and the difference in temperatures of the layers.
	
	For example, the closer layers are together, the more rapidly the temperature
	must change as the aircraft moves from one layer to another. Also, the greater
	the difference in temperatures between adjoining temperature layers, the more
	rapidly the temperature changes as the aircraft ascends or descends.
	
	Flight simulator has a maximum of four temperature layers per weather area.
	
	The maximum allowable temperature range is between -139 to +167 degrees
	Fahrenheit.
