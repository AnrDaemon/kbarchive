	SYMPTOMS
	========

	The HP DeskJet 850C printer driver is a new driver, which Microsoft released
	after Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 3.51. The HP 850C driver incorrectly matches
	orange to yellow.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
	problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0.
