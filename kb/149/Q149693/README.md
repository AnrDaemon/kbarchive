	- Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Exchange client for MS-DOS does not have the ability to use
	multiple Service Providers. It is hard coded to use just the Microsoft Exchange
	Server provider.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is by design. The MS-DOS client does not use the "driver" architecture used
	by the Microsoft Exchange clients for Microsoft Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and
	Windows NT.
