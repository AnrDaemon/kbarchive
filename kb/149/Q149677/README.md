	================
	
	The easiest way to upgrade to MSN 1.2 is to connect to MSN and allow it to
	automatically upgrade your files. However, there may be circumstances in which
	you prefer to manually upgrade to MSN 1.2. For example:
	
	- You successfully upgraded to MSN 1.2, but you have since removed MSN or
	  installed an earlier version of the MSN files.
	
	- You successfully upgraded one computer to MSN 1.2 and you have several other
	  computers you would like to upgrade without spending several minutes of
	  connect time for each upgrade.
	
	To upgrade to MSN 1.2 without connecting to MSN, use the following steps.
	
	NOTE: You must have previously upgraded to MSN 1.2 for these steps to work.
	
	1. Locate the Msn12.inf and Msn12.cab files. These files are normally located in
	  the Program Files/The Microsoft Network folder.
	
	2. Use the right mouse button to click the Msn12.inf file, and then click
	  Install on the menu that appears.
	
	To upgrade several computers, copy the files to each computer, or copy the files
	to a network server that can be accessed from each computer.
