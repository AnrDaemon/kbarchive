	- Microsoft Phone, version 1.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the Microsoft Phone software on a Compaq Presario computer,
	you cannot send DTMF tones while using Speaker Phone.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	DTMF tones are disabled while using Speaker Phone because of problems with the
	Presario's preinstalled modem. Sending a DTMF tone while using Speaker Phone
	would turn off Speaker Phone, hanging up the call.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	DTMF, or touch-tone, is a method used by the telephone system to communicate the
	keys pressed when you dial. Pressing a key generates two simultaneous tones, one
	for the row and one for the column. These are decoded by the exchange to
	determine which key was pressed.
