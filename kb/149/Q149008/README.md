	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When viewing Pregnancy and Child Care, you are unable to copy or print the Help
	contents.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, copy the screen image and paste it into a word
	processing or graphics program such as WordPad or Paint.
	
	To copy and print the screen image, do the following:
	
	1. Open Pregnancy and Child Care and click Help.
	
	2. Locate the Help topic you wish to print.
	
	3. Copy the Help topic by holding-down the ALT key while pressing the PRINT SCRN
	  key (ALT+PRINT SCRN).
	
	4. Start a word processing or graphics program such as WordPad or Paint.
	
	5. Paste the image into the word processing or graphics program.
	
	  NOTE: It may be necessary to crop the screen image because the ALT+PRINT
	  SCREEN key combination copies the Help file selection and other screen
	  elements. You can use the Paintbrush, or Windows 95 Paint program Pick tool
	  to crop the image, adjust the picture size and eliminate unwanted screen
	  elements.
	
	To adjust the image using the Pick tool:
	
	1. On the Paintbrush or Paint toolbar, click the Pick tool (crops) and select
	  the Help menu item selection from the entire image.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Cut.
	
	3. On the File menu, click New, and then click No when asked if you want to keep
	  current changes.
	
	4. On the Edit menu, click Paste. The cropped Help menu item appears.
	
	5. On the File menu, click Print, and then click OK.
	
	For more information about using the Windows techniques described, refer to your
	Windows printed documentation or online Help.
