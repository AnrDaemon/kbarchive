	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A Service Provider ID (SPID) is the number by which an ISDN service provider is
	known. This number is critical to establishing two-way communications using ISDN
	phone services.
	
	To check or change the SPID settings in Windows 95, perform the following steps:
	
	1. In My Computer, double-click Dial-Up Networking.
	
	2. Use the right mouse button to click a connection, and then click Properties
	  on the menu that appears.
	
	3. Verify that the ISDN adapter is selected in the Connect Using box.
	
	4. Click Configure, and then click Advanced.
	
	5. Compare the SPIDs to the numbers provided by the telephone company. If the
	  SPIDs are incorrect, you cannot connect using ISDN.
	
	6. If you were provided a voice SPID and a data SPID, the data SPID should be
	  entered in the Channel 1 field. If the SPIDs are voice/data, they can be
	  entered in any order.
	
	7. If the SPIDs are incorrect, click Modify. A Channel Settings dialog box
	  should be displayed. If not, click the channel number so select the SPID to
	  change, and then click Modify again.
	
	  NOTE: Make sure to click the number. Clicking too far to the right does not
	  work.
	
	  After you modify the SPID, click OK. You must click the second channel number
	  and click Modify to edit another SPID. A line may have one or two SPIDs.
	
	8. Click OK until all dialog boxes are closed.
