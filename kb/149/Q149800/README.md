	When 3D Movie Maker starts, it automatically switches the resolution of the
	screen to 640 x 480 pixels if the resolution is currently set to anything above
	640 x 480 pixels. This allows 3D Movie Maker to fill the entire screen. If you
	do not want 3D Movie Maker to automatically switch the resolution, disable
	switching by changing the default display setting.
