	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	How to use the table:
	
	The Talent Book Page column reflects the Talent Book page number for each actor.
	The Actor column shows the actors name as it appears on the page, and the
	Location column indicates where the actor's page can be found. In many cases, in
	addition to listing the room in which the actor can be found, the listing also
	shows where you must move once you are in the room to get to the appropriate
	location.
	
	For example, Alexander's entry in the lists appears as follows:
	
	Talent
	Book
	Pg  Actor       Location
	------------------------
	1.  Alexander   Projects Room (back): Green bottle on the right.
	
	To get to Alexander's page, go to the Projects Room. In the Projects Room, move
	your mouse to the bottom of the screen and click when the pointer turns into an
	arrow that points backward.
