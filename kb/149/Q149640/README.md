	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When Microsoft Word for Windows 95 is chosen as the e-mail editor for Microsoft
	Exchange clients, a message with it's sensitivity set to Private can be edited.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In the Microsoft Exchange clients for Windows 95 and Windows NT, Microsoft Word
	for Windows 95 can be chosen as the e-mail editor. In addition, in a Microsoft
	Exchange client, you can set the sensitivity of a message to Private so that
	recipients are prohibited from modifying the original message when it is replied
	to or forwarded. However, if Microsoft Word for Windows 95 is set as the e-mail
	editor, a message with it's sensitivity set to Private can still be modified.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word version 7.0 for
	Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
