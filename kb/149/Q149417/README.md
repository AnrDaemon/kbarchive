	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Local and domain users are supposed to be able to copy program icons from common
	groups to their own personal groups (see, for instance, page 46 of the "System
	Guide" for Windows NT Workstation 3.51). However, copying is not possible. When
	a copy attempt is made, using either the CTRL+LEFT MOUSE BUTTON drag method or
	by using the File menu, Copy option, the icon does not appear in the personal
	group. Only Power Users or Administrators are able to successfully copy icons
	from common to personal groups.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
	3.51. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
	Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
	the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
