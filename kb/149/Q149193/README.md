	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are playing an audio CD using the CD Player tool in Windows 95, your
	computer may stop responding (hang) when you click Stop in CD Player.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you are using a Sony CDU-76E CD-ROM drive. The
	computer hangs because of a timing problem between the CD Player tool and the
	CD-ROM drive.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent this behavior from occurring, allow more than one second to elapse
	between clicking Play and Stop in CD Player. If you click Stop immediately after
	clicking Play, the computer may hang.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Sony CDU-76E CD-ROM drive is installed in some Compaq Presario computers as
	original equipment. Sony Corporation is aware of this problem. The CDU-76E
	CD-ROM drive is no longer in production; it has been replaced by the new model
	CDU-77E CD-ROM drive.
