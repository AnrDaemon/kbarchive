	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run a VI editor and try to open a Read-Only file on a File and Print
	Services for NetWare (FPNW) server, it may open a new file for editing as if the
	original was not there. However, when you use the VI editor on the same file on
	a NetWare server, the file opens with no problems.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
