	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to type Chinese characters in an application's text input box, your
	computer produces a beep and does not allow for any input. For example, you
	cannot type any characters in the TO field when you are composing a new mail
	message in Internet Mail.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when the Chinese English switch is not enabled.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Perform the following steps to enable the Chinese English switch:
	
	1. Click the application text input box or related field so that the cursor is
	  located at the appropriate position and then press ALT-SPACE. The Input
	  Method status bar is now activated.
	
	2. Click the Chinese English switch (the left most icon) to toggle between
	  English mode or Chinese mode.
