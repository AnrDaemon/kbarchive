	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Print Preview command or button to preview a document in
	WordPad, some of the words at the end of each line may be truncated.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed above. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This problem occurs only when you preview a document and does not affect
	printing the document. The higher the screen resolution you are using, the more
	characters are truncated.
	
	Note that this problem also affects faxed output in Windows 95. The faxed
	Document appears exactly as the previewed document.
