	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Dial-Up Networking to connect to a Microsoft Windows NT Remote
	Access Service (RAS) server and your password has expired, you are disconnected
	without an option to change the password.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
	the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
	Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you connect to a Windows NT RAS server with an expired password, you
	receive the following error message:
	
	  Password Expired. Contact your network administrator.
	
	When you click OK, you are disconnected.
	
	This behavior is by design. The updated files add the ability to change an
	expired password using the Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking client.
