	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Sounds that you record in 3D Movie Maker may be distorted or of poor quality.
	The same recordings may sound better if they are recorded in the Windows Sound
	Recorder accessory. These two programs record sounds differently.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use the Windows Sound Recorder accessory to record the sounds, then import them
	into 3D Movie Maker. For information about how to record sounds in the Windows
	Sound Recorder, see your Windows 95 or Windows 98 online Help.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Using the Windows Sound Recorder to record your sounds has several advantages
	over recording them in 3D Movie Maker.
	
	- There is a 10-second limit in 3D Movie Maker but not in Sound Recorder.
	
	- Sounds recorded in 3D Movie Maker movies are more difficult to move to other
	  movies.
	
	- Sound Recorder (and other sound utilities) have capabilities to manipulate
	  the sounds that are not included with 3D Movie Maker.
