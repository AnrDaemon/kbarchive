	Before Purchasing Windows 95
	----------------------------
	
	Before you purchase Windows 95, decide whether you are going to purchase the
	CD-ROM version of Windows 95 or the floppy disk version of Windows 95. If you
	have a CD-ROM drive installed in your computer, you should purchase the CD-ROM
	version of Windows 95. The CD-ROM version is preferred for the following
	reasons:
	
	- Installing from a CD-ROM is typically much faster than installing from floppy
	  disks. In addition, installing from a CD-ROM is more convenient because you
	  do not need to swap disks.
	
	- The CD-ROM version of Windows 95 includes additional files that are not
	  included with the floppy disk version. These files include additional
	  accessories such as an Online User's Guide and Windows 95 Tour,
	  administrative tools, wallpaper, and other miscellaneous tools.
	
	- CD-ROMs are more reliable than floppy disks. It is less likely that a Windows
	  95 CD-ROM will become damaged or infected with a virus.
	
	Before you purchase the CD-ROM or floppy disk version of Windows 95, you should
	also make sure that your computer meets the minimum hardware requirements for
	running Windows 95. These requirements include a 386DX or better processor, 4
	megabytes (MB) of memory, one CD-ROM drive or 3.5-inch high-density floppy disk
	drive, and a display adapter and monitor that support VGA or higher resolution.
	For additional information about the installation requirements for Windows 95,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q138349 Windows 95 Installation Requirements
	
	If you are not sure if your computer meets the minimum hardware requirements for
	running Windows 95, obtain the Windows 95 System Check tool. Windows 95 System
	Check is a tool that performs a basic test of your computer's hardware and
	software to ensure compatibility with Windows 95.
	
	Windows 95 System Check is not intended as a comprehensive diagnostics tool to
	check for every known Windows 95 incompatibility. Instead, this tool is designed
	to answer some common questions you might have before you upgrade to Windows 95.
	For information about obtaining Windows 95 System Check, please see the
	following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	Before Installing Windows 95
	----------------------------
	
	Before you upgrade your existing version of Windows or Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows 95, you should perform the following steps:
	
	- Make sure that your computer is not infected with a virus. To do so, run an
	  anti-virus program with the latest virus signatures and allow the program to
	  remove any viruses that it finds.
	
	- Close any programs that run automatically, including anti-virus programs,
	  screen savers, and third-party memory managers and shells.
	
	- Back up all critical data on your hard disk. While it is unlikely that you
	  will encounter a serious problem installing Windows 95, it is always a good
	  idea to perform a complete system backup before install- ing a new operating
	  system. When you upgrade your computer's operating system, it is possible
	  that an error could occur (such as a problem due to incompatible hardware or
	  a power failure) that could temporarily or permanently prevent access to the
	  data on your hard disk.
	
	- Make sure that any network software installed on your computer is functioning
	  properly. The settings from your existing network configuration may not be
	  successfully transferred to Windows 95 if the network software is not
	  functioning properly.
	
	Installing Windows 95
	---------------------
	
	After performing the steps in the previous section, install Windows 95 on your
	computer by following these steps:
	
	1. Insert the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, or insert Windows 95 disk 1
	  in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
	
	2. In File Manager or Program Manager, click Run on the File menu.
	
	3. In the Command Line box, type the following line and then click OK
	
	  " <drive>:\setup.exe " (without the quotation marks)
	
	  where <drive> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive or the floppy disk
	  drive containing Windows 95 disk 1.
	
	4. Follow the instructions on the screen.
	
	If you are installing Windows 95 from a command prompt, follow these steps:
	
	1. Insert the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, or insert Windows 95 disk 1
	  in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
	
	2. Change to the drive containing the Windows 95 CD-ROM or Windows 95 disk 1,
	  type the following line, and then press ENTER:
	
	  " setup " (without the quotation marks)
	
	NOTE: If you are upgrading Windows or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or
	later, you should run Setup from your existing installation of Windows or
	Windows for Workgroups. If you are upgrading Windows version 3.0, you must run
	Setup from a command prompt.
