	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a full page landscape image to a laser printer with Magic School
	Bus products, such as the diver's license in MSB Ocean, you may receive a
	printer memory error. The message varies depending on the printer manufacturer,
	but Out of Memory and Memory Overflow are examples. Only part of the image
	prints.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Because these images contain large graphics and are being printed in landscape
	mode, these images may require more memory than the printer has available. Below
	is a chart of tested printers and their memory requirements. With the exception
	of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) 4L, all 300 DPI (dots per inch) laser printers
	required more than 1 MB RAM to print the image. For 600 DPI printers, more than
	2 MB RAM are required.
