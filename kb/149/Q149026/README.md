	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you insert the Encarta compact disc into your CD-ROM drive, a generic-
	looking icon represents the disc on the screen.
	
	The icon is white and contains the Windows logo.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Encarta 96 compact disc contains an incorrectly named icon file.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	There is no resolution to this problem. No program functionality is lost.
	However, Windows will not automatically update the CD-ROM icon for other Autorun
	compact discs after the Encarta compact disc has been inserted. Restart Windows
	to solve this minor problem.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Encarta Encyclopedia 1996a
	edition. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you insert the disc, Windows looks for a particular file containing
	information about icon appearance. Because the file isn't found, Windows uses a
	generic icon.
