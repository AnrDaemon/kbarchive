	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) included a TrueType font package called "Fonts for the
	Family" with some HP printers. Several of the fonts in this package have proved
	to be incompatible with Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98. When you are using
	these incompatible fonts in any program in Windows 95/98, your computer may stop
	responding (hang). When this occurs, pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE has no effect. You
	must shut down and restart your computer.
