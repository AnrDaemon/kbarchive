	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are using the Microsoft Phone software, the Voice features of a program
	are limited by the program's ability to handle voice commands.
	
	For example, you may want to use Voice to perform a read selection on a set of
	non-adjacent worksheet cells in Microsoft Excel. To do this, Voice must copy the
	selected cells to the Clipboard. Because Microsoft Excel does not allow copying
	non-adjacent cells to the Clipboard, the Voice action does not work.
