	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive the following
	error message:
	
	  Cannot open the online statement. Try again later.
	
	When you click OK, you are prompted whether you want to disconnect. If you click
	No, you receive a blank screen. If you then click Go To MSN Central from the MSN
	icon on the taskbar, MSN operates normally.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the Onlstmt.exe file in the Program Files\The
	Microsoft Network folder is missing or damaged.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:
	
	- Remove and reinstall MSN.
	
	- Extract the Onlstmt.exe file from your original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM to
	  the Program Files\The Microsoft Network folder. The Onlstmt.exe file is
	  located in the Win95_07.cab cabinet file.
