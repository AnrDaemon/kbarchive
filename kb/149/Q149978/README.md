	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft programs listed at the top of this article provide the user with
	command lines to run executable files. If your system is configured to place
	security restrictions on running certain programs, this could potentially
	provide the user with a way to bypass your restrictions.
	
	The command line access is an integral part of these programs and cannot be
	disabled.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can configure a computer system to prevent users from accessing executable
	programs. For example, you can disable the Run command in Explorer and restrict
	access to Files and Folders so users can not locate programs and execute them.
	However, you should be aware that many programs, including the programs listed
	at the top of this article, provide command lines for running programs.
	
	For example, in Microsoft Works 4.0, the user can access Microsoft System
	Information 2.5 (Msinfo32) through the Help menu. MSINFO32 has a Run command on
	the File menu. This lets users enter program names and run them, or browse
	available drives to find executable programs. MSINFO32 is available in many of
	Microsoft's programs marked with the Designed for Windows 95 logo.
	
	In addition to a Run command, some programs have other methods to access
	executable files. Encarta, for example, uses a keyboard shortcut, CTRL+W, to
	activate a word processor. Encarta can be configured to activate any executable
	program when using CTRL+W.
	
	If you provide users with the rights to run these programs, you should consider
	how this might affect your system security plans.
	
	The command line access is an integral part of these programs and cannot be
	disabled.
	
	Accessing Msinfo32
	------------------
	
	To access Msinfo32, do the following:
	
	1. Start the Microsoft program.
	
	2. On the Help menu, click About <product name>, where product name is the
	  Microsoft program you started in Step 1.
	
	3. Click the System Info... button.
