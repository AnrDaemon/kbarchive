	Hardware tool in Control Panel.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you add and then remove the downloadable Windows 95

	Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1 (OSR1) installation.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To regain the Infrared Devices hardware type in the Add New Hardware tool, you
	must reinstall Windows 95 OSR1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If Windows 95 was preinstalled on your computer and you have not installed
	Windows 95 Service Pack 1, you can determine whether you have Windows 95 OEM
	Service Release 1 by using the right mouse button to click My Computer and then
	clicking Properties on the menu that appears. If the version number reported is
	4.00.950a, you are using OEM Service Release 1 and you do not need to install
	IrDA or any of the other Windows 95 Service Pack 1 updates or components.
