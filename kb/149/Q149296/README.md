## Q149296: XCLN: Open Item Above or Below Applies Only to Active Msg

	Article: Q149296

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Exchange Windows clients, the "Open the Item Above It" and "Open
	the Item Below It" options do not apply when you move or delete a selected
	message from a folder.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The "After Moving Or Deleting An Open Item" option allows you to select the
	action you want to occur after an open item is moved or deleted. Depending on
	which option is selected, moving or deleting an open item displays the message
	above or below it upon completion. This only applies when the open message is
	active. If a message is open and that same message is then selected from the
	folder in which it resides, moving or deleting the selected message will not
	refresh the open message window. This is by design.
