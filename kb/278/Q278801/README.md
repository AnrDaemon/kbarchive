## Q278801: MSN Companion Troubleshooting Tool: Logging ID

	Article: Q278801

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Logging ID is a unique alpa-numeric identifier that is generated for each
	MSN Companion.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If an MSN Companion unit experiences any errors during the day, it uploads the
	error list to the MSN Companion Error Log each night during nightly management
	and tags each error with this Logging ID. The Error Log allows the MSN Companion
	team to track problems as they begin to appear, and to fix them as soon as
	possible.
	
	When you call Technical Support with a problem that they can't easily diagnose,
	it is sometimes helpful for the Technical Support team to look up the error logs
	for your unit to see the exact errors that are occurring. Since the member id is
	not recorded in the error logs, Technical Support will need the Logging ID in
	order to see the corresponding errors.
	
	Note: the Logging ID is not useful for diagnosing problems during initial setup.
	The Logging ID is generated the first time the MSN Companion dials up for
	nightly management after initial setup.
	
	How to get the Logging ID
	-------------------------
	
	1. Turn on the MSN Companion and immediately click do not connect.
	
	2. On the main troubleshooting page click I have some other problem that isn't
	  described above.
	
	3. On the contact technical support page click product info.
	
	4. The logging ID is listed on the product information page.
	
	  Typically it's only necessary to read off the first 10 characters of the
	  logging id to get a unique match.
