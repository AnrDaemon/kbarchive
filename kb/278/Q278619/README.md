	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MSN Companion was designed to be upgraded remotely, so the customer wouldn't be
	responsible for buying new hardware or software.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The unit will call the server each night. If an upgrade is available, it will
	download the upgrade automatically. If the upgrade fails, a secondary operating
	system will take over and try to repeat the installation until the installation
	is successful.
	
	Note: This upgrade will be invisible to the customer.
