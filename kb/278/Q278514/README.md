	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	While loading a graphic, the unit appears to "hang" with only 25% of the update
	complete. Unplugging the unit does not clear the action and the you are unable
	to cancel the update.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The MSN Companion unit may require more time when asked to load a graphic.
	Downloading the update for a complex graphic can seem an overly lengthy process.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Give the unit more time to complete the download updating process.
	
	Remember that the speed of your dial-up connection can be impacted by Internet
	traffic congestion. This means that your connection will be slower at a time of
	day when many more people are online, or if signals are having to be routed
	around an Internet problem somewhere (such as a broken backbone cable or hub).
	
	If after giving the unit more time it seems that there may be a problem with your
	unit, please contact MSN Companion Technical Support at (888) 386-6497.
