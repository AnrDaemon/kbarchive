	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Each time the user boots their MSN Companion it goes to some page other than the
	Start page and the user cannot navigate off of that page.
	
	No matter how many times the user reboots, they still boot up to that same page.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	During nightly management or upgrade, the prestart URL for the device was set to
	a URL. However, when the device goes to that URL on boot, there is some code
	error that is preventing the prestart URL from getting reset so that the device
	will boot to the Start page the next time.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Please call MSN Companion Technical Support to resolve this problem at (1) (888)
	386-6497.
