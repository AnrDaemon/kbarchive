## Q79208: FIX: Incorrect CV Info for Local Structure in MASM 6.0

	Article: Q79208
	Product(s): Microsoft Macro Assembler
	Version(s): 6.0,6.0a,6.0b
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 06-MAY-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a program that contains a local structure but no global structures of the
	same type is assembled with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), and that
	variable is watched with the Microsoft CodeView (CV) debugger, CodeView will
	report that the variable has no type.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The CodeView information generated by MASM for that local structure is not
	correct.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Declare a dummy global structure of the same type.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and
	6.0b. This problem was corrected in MASM for MS-DOS version 6.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following sample demonstrates the problem. Bring the .EXE into CodeView and
	begin stepping through. After stepping into procedure "func", the local window
	has:
	
	  <no type> result
	
	To work around the problem, uncomment the global variable "global" and
	reassemble. After stepping into procedure "func", the local window has:
	
	  +struct sample result
	
	Sample Code

	  start:
	      .startup
	      call func
	      .exit 0
	  END
