	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you import previously created program groups into Program Manager, the
	changes you made to the descriptions of these groups while importing them are
	ignored by Windows 3.0.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You can change the description after importing the program group in Windows 3.0.
	Use the following steps to import existing program groups:
	
	1. From Program Manager's File menu, choose New.
	
	2. Select Program Group.
	
	3. Enter the group file's path and filename in the Group File text box.
	
	  NOTE: Any changes you make to the Description text box at this point are
	  ignored and the imported program group displays the description that it had
	  before it was imported.
	
	4. Choose OK.
	
	After importing the group file, you can change its description as you normally
	would:
	
	1. Minimize the program group if necessary.
	
	2. Select the group icon.
	
	3. From the Program Manager File menu, choose Properties.
	
	4. Enter the new description in the Description text box.
	
	STATUS

	problem was corrected and does not occur in later versions.
