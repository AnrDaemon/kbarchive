	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The NEC P9 XL printer driver that ships with Microsoft Windows 3.0 does not
	support color, even though the driver includes a color option and the
	Windows/286 driver for this printer supports color. An update of the driver with
	color support is available directly from NEC.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Under Windows/286, this printer driver supports color printing. However when
	Windows 3.0 was released, the driver was changed and does not support color
	printing. Unfortunately, the printer setup box was not changed to the indicate
	the difference.
	
	NEC has since updated the driver and it now supports color printing, even in
	Paintbrush. To obtain this driver, call NEC.
