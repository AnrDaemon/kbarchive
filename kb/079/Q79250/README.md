	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	IBM has confirmed that the PCJr will not operate properly with Microsoft MS- DOS
	5.0 or later.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A symptom of above incompatibility is the following error message that may be
	displayed during the MS-DOS 5.00 setup routine:
	
	  Runtime Error R6003 - Integer Divide By Zero
	
	Due to the architecture of the IBM PCjr, only MS-DOS versions 2.1 through MS-DOS
	3.3 are considered compatible with the IBM PCjr series of computers.
	
	Note: The IBM PCjr can only access a maximum of 640K. To use as much of the 640K
	as possible, IBM suggests you not use any version of MS-DOS later than 3.3.
	
	The product included here, the IBM PCjr, is manufactured by vendors independent
	of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
	product's performance or reliability.
