	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	With Microsoft Windows 3.1, if you press ALT+TAB to switch between Windows-based
	applications, Windows displays a box that and identifies the last application
	that you accessed.
	
	If you hold the ALT key down, pressing TAB cycles through all of the applications
	that are currently running. When you let go of the ALT key, the identified
	application becomes the active application.
	
	In a virtual machine, the ALT+TAB key sequence still steps through the running
	applications, but rather than displaying a box with an application name and
	icon, it displays a blank MS-DOS screen with the application title listed at the
	top-center of the screen.
	
	NOTE: If you press ALT+TAB and then press ESC before releasing the ALT key, you
	remove the dialog box that displays the selected application.
