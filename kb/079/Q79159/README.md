## Q79159: FIX: Incorrect Code Generated If Operand Is &#91;esp&#93;&#91;esp&#93;

	Article: Q79159
	Product(s): Microsoft Macro Assembler
	Version(s): 6.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 04-MAY-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0, incorrect code is generated
	for instructions using operand [esp][esp], such as the following instructions:
	
	  lea esi, [esp][esp]
	  mov esi, [esp][esp]
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The operand [esp][esp] is not supported in the Intel instruction set. An error
	such as:
	
	  error A2029 : multiple base registers not allowed
	
	should have been generated by the assembler.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
	was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A listing file from the following program will show that the instruction lea
	esi, [esp][esp] is encoded as 8D 34 24. This is incorrect.
	
	Sample Code
	-----------
	
	  ; Assembler options needed: none
	
	  .386
	  .MODEL flat
	  .STACK 4096
	
	  CODE32 SEGMENT PUBLIC USE32
	  main PROC near
	      lea esi, [esp][esp]      ; An error A2029 should be generated.
	      ret
	  main ENDP
	  CODE32 ENDS
	
	  END
