	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The MS-DOS version 5.0 or later upgrades and packaged products are licensed to
	customers for use on one computer at a time. If you want to use MS-DOS on
	another computer (such as a laptop computer), you must remove or uninstall
	MS-DOS before it is used on the other computer. Microsoft Windows version 3.1
	and later is licensed the same as MS-DOS. This also applies to network users.
	
	Microsoft does offer license packs (a license to use the software on one
	computer) and other options for multiuser environments. Contact End User Sales
	(800-426-9400) for more information. A brochure titled "Microsoft Licensing
	Policies: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions" is also available from End User
	Sales.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft programs are licensed differently from Microsoft operating systems. A
	Microsoft Word for Windows licensee who uses a particular computer 80 percent of
	the time can load the program onto a computer she or he uses 20 percent of the
	time, without purchasing another license. This applies to Microsoft products
	such as Microsoft Excel, Word, and Microsoft PowerPoint.
