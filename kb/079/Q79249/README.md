	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you maximize any of the group windows within the Program Manager, the Restore
	command in the Control menu (-) is unavailable (dimmed). Also, other commands
	may be active even though they don't apply to the current state of the window.
	
	NOTE: This behavior does not occur if you open the Control menu using the
	keyboard sequence (ALT+HYPHEN).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This
	problem was corrected and does not occur in later versions.
