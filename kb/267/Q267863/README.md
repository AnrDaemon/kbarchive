	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On Danish Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6 (SP6) installed, if you exceed your
	profile quota by 10 megabytes or more, the error message that states that you
	are over your profile quota limit does not change, even after you reduce your
	profile size to below the limit.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
