	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If your computer has more than 4.2 gigabytes (GB) of commit limit memory,
	Performance Monitor does not display the amount correctly. Instead, the
	displayed value "rolls over." For example, if your computer has 4.5 GB of commit
	limit memory, Performance Monitor displays 300 MB of commit limit memory.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	A DWORD (32-bit) storage value is used to store this value. A 64-bit value is
	used after you apply the hotfix.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
