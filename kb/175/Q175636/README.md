	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you send a message from a Notes client with a Mood Stamp of Thank You to a
	Microsoft Exchange or Outlook Client, the sensitivity icon or description of the
	sensitivity is not displayed. However, sending a Mood Stamp of Personal,
	Private, or Confidential is displayed properly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Exchange and Outlook Clients do not support the Thank You sensitivity.
	Mood Stamp is the Lotus Notes equivalent to Microsoft Exchange and Outlook
	sensitivity options.
	
	This is by product design.
