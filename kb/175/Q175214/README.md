	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	DirWalk is an OCX that can be used as either a control placed on a form or as a
	stand-alone ActiveX server using the CreateObject method. The control is used to
	walk a directory tree and executes the ItemFound event every time a file
	matching the specified criteria is found. The control continues to walk the tree
	until either the entire drive is searched or the fCancel parameter on the
	ItemFound event is set to True.
