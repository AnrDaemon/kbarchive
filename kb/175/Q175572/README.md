	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Using a Unix based web browser with Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) can
	result in typeable fields running off the screen into non-viewable areas.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The OWA code for Unix browsers assumes Times Roman 12 for proportional fonts and
	Courier 10 for fixed width fonts. If a client is not set to use these fonts, the
	above display problem may occur.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
	version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
