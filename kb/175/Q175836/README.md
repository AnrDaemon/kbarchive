	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you send a Low Delivery Priority message from a Lotus Notes client to an
	Exchange client through the Exchange Notes Connector, the message is not
	delivered. A non-delivery report (NDR) is not generated. However, a High or
	Normal Delivery Priority message from a Lotus Notes client to an Exchange client
	will be delivered.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This occurs when you use the Exchange Notes Connector and is by design.
