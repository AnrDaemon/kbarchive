	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook, it is not possible to use the
	Recover Deleted Items option to restore deleted items from the Public Folders
	folder, the Favorites folder, or any subfolders in the Favorites folder. These
	folders are special folders and will never contain deleted items. This behavior
	is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you select any of the folders mentioned above, it is possible to access the
	Recover Deleted Items option from the Tools menu. The list of recoverable items
	that is subsequently shown will always be empty, because these folders will
	never contain deleted items.
