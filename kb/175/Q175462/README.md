	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	"Readings on Microsoft Windows and WOSA" was originally designed to help prepare
	the reader for two Microsoft Certified Professional exams, Exam 70- 150,
	Microsoft Windows Operating Systems and Services Architecture I, and exam
	70-151, Microsoft Windows Operating Systems and Services Architecture II.
	
	Microsoft has phased out these two exams in favor of Exam 70-160, Microsoft
	Windows Architecture I, and Exam 70-161, Microsoft Windows Architecture II.
	
	Due to this change, Microsoft Press has created a replacement for the book
	"Readings on Microsoft Windows and WOSA."
