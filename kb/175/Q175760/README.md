	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The buffer length for the edit window in the Analyze.exe utility is limited to
	approximately 30,000 characters. For large databases or situations where lots of
	error messages are displayed, messages at the beginning of the buffer may not be
	viewable in the edit window.
	
	All errors should be in the Analyze.exe log file (named Analyze.log by default)
	because it is not truncated due to the edit window buffer limit.
