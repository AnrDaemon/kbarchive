	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Introductory Flight, Boeing 737-400, stops responding during the beginning
	portion of the lesson. You are able to take off and make the first turn, but
	during the second turn, moving toward 010 degrees, your computer stops
	responding.
	
	If you wait for 10-20 minutes you receive the following error message:
	
	  This machine has run out of available memory. Flight Simulator will now exit.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a problem with the Boeing 737-400 flight lesson.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Flight Simulator 98.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To work around this problem, disable sound when the instructor says to turn to
	010 degrees. Turn the sound back on when you have reached the 010 degree
	heading.
	
	To turn the sound on and off, follow these steps:
	
	1. Press the Q key on the keyboard to turn off the sound just after you hear the
	  command to turn to 010 degrees.
	
	2. Continue the turn keeping your altitude at 4000ft with a 30-degree bank to
	  the right.
	
	3. After reaching 010 degrees you can press the Q key again to turn the sound
	  back on.
	
	At this point you will be able to hear the commands from the instructor and
	finish the lesson.
