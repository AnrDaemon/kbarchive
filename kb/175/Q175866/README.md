	- The Microsoft Network versions 2.0, 2.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, a message is displayed notifying
	you of how many new e-mail messages you have received. When you download your
	new e-mail, the notification message remains on the screen but may still show
	the same number of new e-mail messages.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The e-mail notification message is updated at intervals of every three to five
	minutes.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To update the e-mail notification message immediately, load another MSN Web
	page, such as the Essentials Home Page, and then click the Back button to return
	to the previous page. This forces MSN to check for new e-mail and update the
	e-mail notification message.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior can also occur if you have configured your MSN e-mail account to
	leave a copy of your e-mail messages on the MSN mail server.
