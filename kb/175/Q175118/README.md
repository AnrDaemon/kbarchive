	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In the Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, when you compose a meeting
	request or appointment that includes an attachment, the file size of the
	attachment is incorrectly displayed as 1 KB. This may occur regardless of the
	actual size of the attachment. However, the recipient of the meeting request or
	appointment will see the correct size displayed for the attachment.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access
	version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
