	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf 98. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can download the Bs96ingn.lst file from the following Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://bookshelf.msn.com/na/inetdir/updates.asp
	
	Bookshelf 98 does not require the Internet Directory updates provided by the
	Bs96ingn.lst file. To maintain updated Web links, Bookshelf 98 uses a redirector
	on the Bookshelf Web site.
	
	SUMMARY

	If you remove Microsoft Bookshelf 98 using the Remove All option, the Setup
	program deletes the Bs96ingn.lst file from the Bookshelf 96 folder. This file
	contains the updates to the Internet Directory 96 included with Microsoft
	Bookshelf 1996-97.
