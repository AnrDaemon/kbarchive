	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your computer stops responding (hangs) while you are using an Iomega PC2X 8-Bit
	Bernoulli Controller card.
	
	CAUSE

	Controller card may not function properly on 486/33 megahertz (MHz) and faster
	computers.
	
	For setup purposes, you may need to run Setup with the ignore hardware detection
	parameter, /I, (use the command SETUP /I).
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use a slower computer or a different Bernoulli
	controller card.
