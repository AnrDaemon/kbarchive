	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have insufficient memory available, MIDI sounds and pronunciations in
	Bookshelf will not be able to play. If there is insufficient memory, an
	explanatory message should appear, but this does not always occur.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
	as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Bookshelf requires a minimum of 4 megabytes (MB) of RAM. If you have 4 MB of RAM
	but are still experiencing problems playing MIDI sounds and pronunciations, try
	to reduce the amount of memory used by your System, fonts, INITs, and so on. For
	more information about optimizing your memory for use with Bookshelf, refer to
	topic #2, "Memory Use," in the Bookshelf 1994 Readme file.
