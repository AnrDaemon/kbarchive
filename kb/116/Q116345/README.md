	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Bookshelf 1994 may not be able to display correctly with Virtual Desktop version
	1.7. Virtual Desktop installs an extension that allows you to expand the desktop
	area and then scroll around within it. However, when you scroll using Virtual
	Desktop, Bookshelf loses track of where the various components of its display
	should be placed on the screen. The Bookshelf window (icons, scrollbars, menu
	bar, buttons, text boxes, drop-down lists, and so on) may become disarrayed or
	may appear corrupted.
	
	This problem is documented in the Bookshelf 1994 Readme file.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, do not run Bookshelf and Virtual Desktop together.
