	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your custom modem settings will not be retained when you choose a predefined
	setting in Complete Baseball. If you do not leave Baseball set to your custom
	settings, you may have to retype these settings every time you want to reselect
	them.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Complete Baseball for Windows,
	1994 edition. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. In Complete Baseball, choose Options.
	
	2. Choose Baseball Daily Settings.
	
	3. Choose Modem Settings.
	
	4. Choose Advanced Settings.
	
	  The default setting is Hayes-Compatible. Under Other, the unavailable (dimmed)
	  modem command setting "ATQ0V1E0X4S0=0" appears.
	
	5. Select Other and type any text (such as "test" (without the quotation
	  marks)).
	
	6. Select Hayes-Compatible again.
	
	The text you typed under Other disappears. The Other setting reverts back to its
	original string setting. Your custom entry should remain in the Other list even
	when Other is no longer selected.
