	Some countries (such as the United States) use three digits to group currency.
	For example:

	Some countries (such as India and Pakistan) use three digits in the first group,
	and two digits in all subsequent groups. For example:
	
	  $12,34,56,789.00
	
	Windows 95 provides support for grouping digits in groups of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
	7, 8, 9, or 10. It does not currently provide a secondary grouping option.
