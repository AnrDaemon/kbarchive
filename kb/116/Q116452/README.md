	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Berkeley Systems After Dark with Windows 95, the following problems
	occur:
	
	- When you install the After Dark screen saver, an After Dark button is created
	  on the taskbar; however, clicking this button with the left mouse button does
	  not open the After Dark control panel.
	
	- A blank button appears on the taskbar when the After Dark screen saver is
	  active.
	
	- A button labeled "Password" appears on the taskbar when the Password dialog
	  box appears.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	According to Berkeley Systems Technical Support, After Dark version 2.0 for
	Windows and its add-on components based on the After Dark 2.0 engine are not
	fully compatible with Windows 95.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	- If you click the After Dark button using the right (secondary mouse button,
	  the Control menu appears. The After Dark control panel is one of the
	  selections. You can also click the After Dark icon on the desktop, rather
	  than the button on the taskbar, to open the After Dark control panel.
	
	- The blank button on the taskbar serves no function, but it cannot be
	  disabled.
	
	- The button labeled "Password" on the taskbar serves no function; however, the
	  only way to prevent it from appearing is to disable After Dark's password
	  support.
