	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1994 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start the Complete Baseball Trivia game, the default options Pre-Game
	Warmup and All (under categories) are selected. If you play a game with other
	settings and then exit from and return to Trivia, your custom settings will not
	be retained. Instead, the Trivia game will again be set to the default options.
	However, the name of the most recent player is remembered and selected by
	default.
	
	This behavior is by design.
