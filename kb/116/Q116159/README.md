	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you remove the Complete Baseball CD from the CD-ROM drive while you are at
	the main menu, you may receive the following error message if you try to choose
	one of the selections (such as Almanac or Teams):
	
	  System Error
	  Cannot read from drive X.
	
	where X is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.
	
	If you continue to make selections, you may eventually receive an error message
	such as the following:
	
	  Cannot open file "X:\baggage\filename.m11." Please make sure the Complete
	  Baseball CD is in the drive, and then click OK to try again, or click Cancel
	  to close complete Baseball.
	
	If you choose Cancel, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault.
	
	NOTE: This problem also occurs with Microsoft Complete Baseball Guide for
	Windows, 1995 edition running in Microsoft Windows 3.1x.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, do not remove the Complete Baseball CD while the program
	is running. It is never a good idea to remove any disk or CD while your computer
	is reading it.
