	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you try to install Bookshelf 1994 on a nonstartup disk, Bookshelf will not
	function correctly. Some system files such as QuickTime, Sound Manager 3.0, and
	the Bookshelf fonts won't be installed at all.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf, 1994 edition. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you try to install Bookshelf to a nonstartup disk, it does the following:
	
	- Installs the Bookshelf application, the readme file, TeachText, and the
	  catalog alias to the Bookshelf 1994 folder.
	
	- If a system folder does not exist on the drive, Bookshelf setup creates one
	  and installs QuickShelf to it.
	
	The rest of the system files do not get installed.
