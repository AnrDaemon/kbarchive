## Q116247: Computers in Docking Stations May Not Provide APM Support

	Article: Q116247
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	- When you run Windows 95 on a computer with Advanced Power Management (APM),
	  the Suspend command does not appear on the Start menu, and/or the APM item
	  does not appear in Control Panel.
	
	  -or-
	
	- The Windows 95 Setup program does not detect the APM support on an
	  APM-capable computer.
	
	The MS-DOS real-mode APM support (POWER.EXE) may function properly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If your computer disables APM functionality while it is in a docking station
	(such as the Zenith 420s and 425s computers do), you do not have access to the
	APM features in Windows 95.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	APM support on these computers is not available while they are docked. After you
	remove the machine from the docking station, add the APM support back into
	Windows 95.
