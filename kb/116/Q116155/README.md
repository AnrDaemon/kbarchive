	Sharp fax machines are incompatible with Class 2 modems. Although Microsoft
	At Work PC Fax may be able to send faxes to these machines, it cannot
	receive faxes from them. The Sharp fax machine does not respond properly to
	the ATA command to answer an incoming call. This problem was confirmed with
	the Sharp Model FO5220 fax machine and the Intel 144/144e modem.
