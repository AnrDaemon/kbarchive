	Article: Q116346
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Holding down the OPTION key does not alter COMMAND key combinations in Bookshelf
	1994. COMMAND+OPTION key combinations should differ from COMMAND key
	combinations.
	
	For example, pressing COMMAND+A highlights the text in the current article.
	Pressing COMMAND+OPTION+A does exactly the same thing.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf for the Macintosh, 1994
	edition. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
