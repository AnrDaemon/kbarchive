	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Outlook, after recovering a large number of items from the Deleted
	Items folder using the Recover Deleted Items option, the recovered items may not
	immediately show up in the Deleted Items folder.
	
	This usually occurs with a large number of items (more than 1,000).

	Microsoft Outlook does not refresh the list of items in the folder.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Select another folder, such as the Inbox, and then select the Deleted Items
	folder again. The recovered items should be viewable.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Outlook, version 8.03. We
	are researching this problem and will post more information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
