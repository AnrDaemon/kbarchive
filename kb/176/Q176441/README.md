	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use a third-party Internet service provider (ISP) to send and receive
	e-mail in Microsoft Outlook Express, when you run automatic mail configuration
	on MSN, The Microsoft Network, the MSN Mail e-mail account in Outlook Express is
	restored to its default configuration and you may no longer be able to send and
	receive e-mail using your third-party ISP.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design. Automatic mail configuration is designed to
	configure the MSN Mail e-mail account to send and receive e-mail using the MSN
	e-mail servers.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, create another e-mail account in Outlook Express with a
	name other than "MSN Mail" to use with your third-party ISP e-mail account.
	
	For information about creating e-mail accounts in Outlook Express, click Content
	And Index on the Help menu, click the Index tab, type adding mail accounts, and
	then click Display.
