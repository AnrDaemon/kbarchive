	When you are running Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 and using ISINTEG to
	check the private information store, you may receive an error similar to the
	following during the reference count verification test:
	
	  Warning: Folder[0001-000000000144].Midset: Replid(4) misses some mids
	  Warning: Folder[0001-000000000144].Midset:
	  Name = Inbox, parentFID = 0001-000000000141,
	  rootFID = 0001-000000000140
	  ptagSegmentStart = 0001-00000000070C, ptagSegmentIndex = 4, #messages =
	  3, #sub-folders = 1
	  Missing interval = [0004-000000000001, 0004-00000001000D]
