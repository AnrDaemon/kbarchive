	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Users who are allowed to edit the membership can use the Microsoft Exchange

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you create a distribution list (DL) on an Exchange Server computer and choose
	the Hide Membership from Address Book option or the Hide from Address Book
	option on the Advanced tab, anyone who is allowed to edit the membership
	(including the owner and administrators) will still be able to view the DL
	membership.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design.
