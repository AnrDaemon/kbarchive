	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Service Pack 1 on a computer on which the Japanese Microsoft
	Exchange Windows 95 client is installed, the following message appears when the
	installation process finishes:
	
	  Exchange Client successfully updated
	
	This message is misleading, because it implies that the client has updated
	something. In fact, the client itself has been updated.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Service Pack 1 for Microsoft
	Exchange version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
	Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
	Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
