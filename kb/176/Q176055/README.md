	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MSN, The Microsoft Network, uses the Msn.ini file to automatically configure MSN
	Program Viewer. When you connect to MSN, MSN Program Viewer compares the copy of
	the Msn.ini file on the server to the copy on your computer. If your computer
	has an older version of the Msn.ini file or if the Msn.ini file is not present,
	MSN Program Viewer copies the server version of the Msn.ini file to your
	computer.
	
	If you use Windows 98 the Msn.ini file contains menu information for the Quick
	View program on the System Tray and information for the default MSN home page.
	
	A damaged Msn.ini file can cause problems when you use MSN Program Viewer. If you
	suspect that your Msn.ini file is damaged, you can delete or rename all copies
	of the Msn.ini file on your computer, and then connect to MSN to automatically
	receive a new copy of the Msn.ini file.
