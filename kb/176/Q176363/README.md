	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Flight Simulator 98
	-------------------
	
	The ADF indicator is always on in the Bell 206B JetRanger, Cessna 182R RG, Cessna
	182S, Extra 300S, and the Boeing 737-400. In these planes, with the exception of
	the Boeing 737-400, the ADF indicator is a white arrow on the ADF gauge. In the
	Boeing 737-400 the ADF indicator is a yellow arrow on the Radio Magnetic
	Indicator (RMI).
	
	In the Learjet 45, you can turn on the ADF by clicking the Toggle ADF switch.
	This button is located below the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) at the
	bottom of the primary instrument display. In the Learjet, the ADF indicator is a
	blue arrow located on the HSI. (This indicator is listed incorrectly as a yellow
	arrow in the Pilot's Help file.)
	
	Flight Simulator 95
	-------------------
	
	The ADF is turned on and off when you press the SHIFT+TAB key combination on you
	keyboard in the Cessna RG R182, the Extra 300s, and the Learjet 35A (the Learjet
	toggles between VOR 1, VOR 2, and ADF). In all of these planes, with the
	exception of the Learjet 35A, the ADF indicator is a white arrow on the ADF
	gauge. In the Learjet 35A the ADF indicator is a yellow arrow on the ADF gauge.
	
	In the Boeing 737-400 the ADF indicator is a yellow arrow on the Radio Magnetic
	Indicator (RMI) and is always on.
	
	NOTE: There is no ADF in the Sopwith Camel or the Sailplane in Flight Simulator
	98 or Flight Simulator 95.
