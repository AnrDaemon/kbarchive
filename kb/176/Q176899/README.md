	This article describes how to find detailed preflight briefing information in
	the Flight Simulator online Help file.
	
	Some lessons and adventures in Flight Simulator 98/2000 refer you to the
	"Preflight Briefings" topic in the online Help file, or they refer you to the
	preflight briefing information for a particular lesson.
	
	As an example, the description for the Introductory Flight of the 737-400
	installed by Flight Shop Converter 98 refers you to the "Preflight Briefing:
	Introductory Flight--Boeing 737-400" topic in the online Help file.

	file is not dynamically linked to the active lesson or adventure. The "Preflight
