## Q176890: FS95/98/2000: How to Use the POV Hat and POV Keyboard Commands

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to use the point-of-view (POV) controls assigned to
	the hat switch on your joystick or to certain keys on the keyboard.
	
	In Flight Simulator 98, you can use the hat switch on your joystick to rotate the
	view in a 360-degree panorama around the cockpit of your aircraft.
	
	NOTE: This can cause confusion in a normal cockpit view window, because the
	control panel in normal cockpit view always remains in front of you. This can
	create the illusion that the aircraft is changing direction with the view when
	the aircraft actually remains on the original heading.
	
	In Flight Simulator 95, when you use the POV hat button, you can rotate your view
	up to a 90-degree angle to the plane.
	
	You can also use keyboard commands to switch between views and to resume normal
	view in Flight Simulator. The keyboard commands used to change views are listed
	in the "More Information" section later in this article. The basic commands are
	the same for both Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 95; however, there
	are more commands for Flight Simulator 98 to allow for the 360-degree panorama
	option.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The POV hat button movements and keyboard commands that can be used to switch
	views in Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 95 are listed below.
	
	NOTE: When you type the keyboard commands listed below, you must use the number
	keys on the numeric keypad on your keyboard.
