## Q176146: XCON: X.400 Connector Line-Wrap Cuts Msg Line at 80 Chars

	Article: Q176146
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator allows you to set the line-wrap
	option on the General tab of the properties for an X.400 Connector. This
	line-wrap option causes the text of the message to be cut off at 80 characters;
	words are cut off right in the middle. This is not the expected behavior.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
	Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
	Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
