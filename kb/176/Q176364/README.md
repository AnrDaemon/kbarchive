	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Flight Simulator 98 or Flight Simulator 2000 for the first time,
	the computer may appear to stop responding (hang) when the following message is
	displayed:
	
	  Building database for new scenery files. This process may take a few minutes.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because Microsoft Flight Simulator builds a database of
	installed scenery files when you start the program for the first time.
	
	Depending on the speed of your computer, this process may take as long as to
	several minutes to complete, during which time the computer may seem to stop
	responding.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The next time that you start Flight Simulator, the program takes much less time
	to load the scenery files.
