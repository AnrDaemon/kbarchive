	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The build number of the released (RTM) version of Microsoft Exchange Server is
	1960.8. However, you will see different build number information in the
	Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, as shown below:
	
	- The Help/About dialog box shows Version 5.5 (Build 1960.5). This information
	  is obtained from the version of ADMIN.EXE found in the \EXCHSRVR\BIN
	  directory.
	
	- The General tab of the Server object's Properties dialog box shows Version
	  5.5 (Build 1960.7).
	
	This does not affect the behavior or functionality of Microsoft Exchange Server.
