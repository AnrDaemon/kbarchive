	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click a menu or change aircraft in Flight Simulator 98 or Flight
	Simulator 2000, your Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro joystick may stop responding.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:
	
	- Your SideWinder 3D Pro joystick is connected to a Microsoft SideWinder game
	  pad that is connected to the game port on your computer.
	
	- You are running Flight Simulator on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based
	  computer. Windows NT 4.0 does not support digital game controllers such as
	  the SideWinder game pad.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, connect the SideWinder 3D Pro joystick directly to the
	game port on your Windows NT 4.0-based computer.
