	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you double-click a shortcut to an MS-DOS-based program that is set to run
	in a normal window, the program may be maximized when it opens.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if the program window was maximized and then closed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, start the MS-DOS-based program, and then press
	ALT+ENTER. This restores the program to a normal window. Note that you can
	toggle between normal window and maximized at any time by pressing ALT+ENTER.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
	as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Windows-based programs contain program-specific settings which determine the
	window state at startup. The normal window setting for a shortcut to a
	Windows-based program starts the program in it's default window state.
