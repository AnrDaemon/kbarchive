## Q176163: XADM: Restart Services Disabled After Performance Optimizer Use

	Article: Q176163
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WinNT:5.5
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusagekbbuglist

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you run the Performance Optimizer for Exchange Server and proceed to the
	final step, a dialog box opens to display the services to be restarted. If there
	are more than five Exchange services to be restarted, a scroll bar will be
	displayed, but the scroll bar is not functional and will not allow selective
	restarting of the services. The only choices are "Next," which will restart all
	Exchange-related services, or "Do not restart these services," which will
	prevent restarting of any Exchange services.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
