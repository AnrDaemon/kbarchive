	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Cover: For Exam 70-222 No Longer Applies
	----------------------------------------
	
	The front cover, spine, and back cover of this Training Kit imply that the
	Training Kit is geared toward the MCP Exam 70-222, however this no longer
	applies due to the changes in the objectives for this exam.
	
	Exam 70-222 is still in development and will be released in its beta version by
	July 2000. Because the objectives for the exam were not yet finalized when this
	Training Kit was first published, the Training Kit does not map exactly to this
	exam, nor to the direction this exam is taking in its development.
	
	Since the exam objectives have changed, please disregard the references on the
	cover.
	
	
	Page xxii & 25: Hardware Requirements Should Read Pentium 133
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page xxii and on page 25, the Hardware Requirements should read Pentium 133
	instead of Pentium 166.
	
	
	Page 113: Distinguished Name Format Is Incorrect

	Page 304: Incorrect Scope In Figure 10.3
	----------------------------------------

	"192.168.1.1... 192.168.1.254"
