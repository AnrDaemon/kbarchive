	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In large organizations, when you search for the distribution lists of additional
	servers, you may need to view names from the global address list instead of from
	the mailbox Recipients container. This process can be time consuming if you need
	to search different servers to determine which distribution list that you want.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In earlier versions of Exchange Server, if you modify a distribution list in the
	Exchange Server Administrator program from the user's mailbox properties, the
	"Show Names from the" list defaults to the Recipients container of the user's
	mailbox. After you apply Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3, the "Show Names
	from the" list defaults to the global address list.
