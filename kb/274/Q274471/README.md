## Q274471: MSN Explorer Setup Does Not Recognize Installed Internet Explore

	Article: Q274471

	Version(s): 5,6.0,6.1
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network versions 6.0, 6.1 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 for Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 for Windows 98 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When attempting to install MSN Explorer Preview 2 from the Internet, it prompts
	you to download Internet Explorer 5 when it is already installed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	MSN Explorer will not recognize a beta release of Internet Explorer as a full
	version. As MSN Explorer is downloading, it reads the machine as not having
	Internet Explorer. Instead of a 5 MB download of MSN Explorer only, it will
	attempt a 17 - 24 MB download of MSN Explorer and Internet Explorer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You must install a complete version of the most recent version of Internet
	Explorer. There are two ways you can do this.
	
	- You can allow MSN Explorer to download and install Internet Explorer.
	  However, it is not a "smart" download. A smart download will, if interrupted,
	  start again from where it was stopped. If the MSN Explorer download of
	  Internet Explorer is interrupted, you will need to start the download process
	  again from the start.
	
	- It is recommended that you cancel the MSN Explorer download and get a smart
	  download of the latest version of Internet Explorer from the Microsoft Web
	  site. Go to:
	
	  http://www.windowsupdate.com
	
	  1. Click Product Updates.
	     The program will read your machine and offer you various updates.
	
	  2. Select Internet Explorer, clear any other checkboxes (you can come back to
	     these later if you wish), and then click Download.
	
	  3. Confirm that you are about to download Internet Explorer and click
	     Download Now.
	
	  4. Follow any other instructions you are given.
	
	After Internet Explorer has been installed, download and install MSN Explorer. Go
	to:
	
	  http://preview.msn.com/
