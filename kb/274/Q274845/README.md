	To manually back up your saved games in Crimson Skies:
	
	1. Quit Crimson Skies.
	
	2. Right-click the Start button, and then click Explore.
	
	3. Open the following default Crimson Skies installation folder
	
	  <drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Crimson Skies
	
	  where <drive> is the letter of the hard disk on which Crimson Skies is
	  installed.
	
	NOTE: If you installed Crimson Skies to an alternate folder, browse to that
	folder.
	4. In the Crimson Skies folder, right-click the SavedGames folder, and then

	folder from the location that you copied it to, back to the Crimson Skies
	folder.
	
	NOTE: When you copy the SavedGames folder back into the Crimson Skies folder, you
	overwrite all the files in the SavedGames folder and any missions that you saved
	after you copied the folder to the backup location.
