	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	<B7> The user can send e-mail, but has never successfully received e-mail.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When the account was created, the e-mail routing was never set up properly, so
	the e-mail messages sent to the customer never get routed to the Hotmail mailbox
	that MSN Companion uses. The messages send successfully because the Hotmail
	mailbox was created correctly.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	1. Escalate these types of users to MSNIANOC: Tell MSNIANOC that the user's
	  email routing is not configured correctly for MSN Companion, and to run a
	  standard e-mail reset with the user.
	  When MSNIANOC responds saying that the user has been fixed, the user's e-mail
	  issues will be resolved.
	
	2. Send the customer an email to let them know that their e-mail is fixed, or
	  call the user directly.
