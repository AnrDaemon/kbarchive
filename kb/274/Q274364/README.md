	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MSN Companion has several secret codes that give access to special
	troubleshooting information on the device or that perform special
	troubleshooting actions.
	
	The HAMMER code resets all dialing options to their factory presets, but still
	retains the local access numbers that the customer has chosen. It also sets the
	local numbers to an unconfirmed state. This means that the next time you try to
	dial the local access numbers, it will try all possible dialing combinations
	(7-digit, 10-digit, 11-digit) for these numbers until it finds the right
	combination and will then save the correct settings.

	When should I use the "HAMMER" code?
	------------------------------------
	
	HAMMER should be used when you want to reset your dialing settings. A few
	examples:
	
	- The telephone company changes the dialing rules in your area code, requiring
	  you to dial the area code for some numbers.
	
	- You want to completely reset your dialing settings to the factory presets in
	  order to troubleshoot a dialing problem. (Note: you will still need to use
	  the "FIXIT" secret code to change the local access numbers. See See also:
	  Q278481 - MSN Companion Troubleshooting Tool FIXIT)
	
	How do I enter the "HAMMER" code?
	---------------------------------
	
	1. Turn on the MSN Companion and immediately click do not connect.
	
	2. On the main troubleshooting page click I have some other problem that isn't
	  described above.
	
	3. In the text entry box type hammer and click Go.
	
	4. The MSN Companion will reset all dialing settings (except the local access
	  numbers) to their factory presets, and will restart.
