	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Metal Gear Solid 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Metal Gear Solid with a Microsoft SideWinder gamepad,
	some game commands such as Switch Weapon or Switch Item may not function as
	expected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because some game commands, such as Switch Weapon or
	Switch Item, require that you hold down the SHIFT key while you press a button
	on the controller to activate the command.
	
	NOTE: The game recognizes the START button on the Microsoft SideWinder gamepad as
	the SHIFT key.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, press the START button on the SideWinder gamepad when you
	use a command that requires you to hold down the SHIFT key.
