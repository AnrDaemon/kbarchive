	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to install the classic version of Microsoft Flight Simulator
	for Windows 95, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  Setup has detected a newer version of Microsoft Flight Simulator. You cannot
	  install this version over a newer one.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 or Microsoft Flight
	Simulator 2000 is installed on your computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, remove Flight Simulator 98 or Flight Simulator 2000
	before you install the classic version of Flight Simulator for Windows 95. To do
	this:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
	
	3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 or
	  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, and then click Add/Remove.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design. Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 2000
	contain far more features than the classic version of Flight Simulator for
	Windows 95. For this reason, you cannot install the earlier version of Flight
	Simulator over the later version.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
