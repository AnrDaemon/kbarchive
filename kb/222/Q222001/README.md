	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a recurring appointment in the Outlook Calendar, you may not get
	the following "Open Recurring Item" prompt:
	
	  Appointment subject is a recurring appointment. Do you want to open only this
	  occurrence or the series?
	
	- Open this occurrence
	
	- Open the series
	
	Instead, the appointment series is opened.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. You only get the "Open Recurring Item" prompt when you are in
	Day/Week/Month view. All other views only allow you to open the series.
