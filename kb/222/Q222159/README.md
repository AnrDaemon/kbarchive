	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you modify the "\??" object folder's symbolic link table by substituting a
	different case (upper versus lower) letter in the table to point to a different
	device associated with a disk drive alias, it may be possible to bypass typical
	Windows NT security and allow any user to acquire administrator privileges.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
	pack, please go to:
