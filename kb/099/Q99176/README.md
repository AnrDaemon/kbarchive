	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Bookshelf, the index to the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia lists some names
	incompletely.
	
	For example, quotations by Francois Duc de La Rochefoucauld are listed in the
	index as being by "Francois." Quotations by Henri Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec are
	listed in the index as being by "Henri." This problem also occurs with other
	names, including the following: "Honore," "Hugh," "Joachim," "John," "Luc," and
	"Ouida."
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
