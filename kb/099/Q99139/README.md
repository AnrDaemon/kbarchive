	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the SESSION.LOG file allows
	for only 10 characters of the External instance name to be shown. The remaining
	characters will be truncated. For ease of identification, give instances of
	External "normal-sounding" names.
	
	Because Microsoft Mail log file format is fixed (as opposed to tab delimited),
	logging more than 10 characters results in larger log files.
	
	
	Additional query words: 3.20
