## Q99637: Mac Wkst: On Cue Modifies Enclosure Save Dialog Box

	Article: Q99637
	Product(s): Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.1,3.1a,3.1c,3.1d

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1c, 3.1d 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Icon Simulation's On Cue II version 1.0 includes a function called "On Disk,"
	which modifies the behavior of the enclosure Save dialog box in versions 3.0 and
	3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. When there are more than two
	enclosures, only the first enclosure can be selected; therefore, only that
	enclosure can be saved with the Save button. All enclosures can still be saved
	with the Save All button.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Removing On Cue II from the Macintosh is the only current resolution to this
	problem. Because On Cue includes the functionality of the "On Disk" desk
	accessory, removing the desk accessory does not correct the problem.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Icon Simulation's On Cue II
	version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
