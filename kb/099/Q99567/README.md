	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Use the LAN Manager for Macintosh Services add-in to hook up Macintosh machines
	(already on a 10BaseT topology) running Microsoft Mail to a LAN Manager network
	that has TCP/IP (w/SMTP) loaded. This adds an AppleTalk stack and AFP-compliant
	server function to your LAN Manager server and allows you to run the standard
	Mac client for Microsoft Mail for PC LANs.
