	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are using Bookshelf, a small (approximately 25-pixels high) scrolling
	region may appear at the bottom of your Bookshelf window. This extra scrolling
	region displays a second copy of the title graphic.
	
	This problem only occurs the first time a graphic is displayed. The extraneous
	scrolling region appears on each title screen as well as on the "books" screen.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Multimedia Viewer
	version 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	as it becomes available.
