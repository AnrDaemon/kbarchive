	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you are using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet series printer with a version
	2.1 printer driver from Hewlett-Packard, you may receive the following error
	message when you try to open or print from a Windows- based application or
	change the setup of your DeskJet printer:
	
	  HP DeskJet Series v2.1 Error
	
	  Printer Fonts missing; select "Printer Fonts" to install fonts or select "OK"
	  again to exit
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you use version 2.1 of the HP DeskJet series printer drivers with a
	DeskJet, there is an option to install printer and/or screen fonts from the
	drivers disks. If these fonts have been installed, the system sometimes is
	unable to locate them. In this case, the fonts need to be reinstalled. To do
	this, use the workaround listed below. For more information or assistance, call
	Hewlett-Packard Technical Support
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	1. Open Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.
	
	2. Select the DeskJet printer from the list of installed printers, then choose
	  Setup.
	
	3. Choose Fonts, choose Printer Fonts, then choose OK.
	
	4. In the Install Printer Fonts dialog box, choose Install Fonts.
	
	5. Insert the second disk for the HP printer driver version 2.1 in your floppy
	  disk drive. In the Install Fonts: Source Directory box, type the path to the
	  disk. For example, if your floppy disk drive is A, type "A:\" (without the
	  quotation marks).
