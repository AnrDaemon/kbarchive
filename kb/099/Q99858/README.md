	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	WordPerfect Technical Support has confirmed that if you switch from the Windows
	Printing System (WPS) print driver to another Hewlett- Packard (HP) Windows
	printer driver within WordPerfect for Windows version 5.2, the TrueType fonts in
	your current document may change.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This situation can occur when you change any Windows printer driver. WordPerfect
	for Windows, as well as other Windows-based applications, maintains a table of
	available fonts. When you change to another printer driver, the fonts may be
	inappropriately mapped to a similar font, either a TrueType font or a
	printer-resident font. This process is entirely handled by the specific
	application.
	
	For more information, call WordPerfect Laser Printing Technical Support.
	
	WordPerfect for Windows is manufactured by WordPerfect Corporation, a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	this product's performance or reliability.
