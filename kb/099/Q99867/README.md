	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Musical Instruments for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Random option in Musical Instruments runs a "slide show" of randomly
	selected instruments and plays their sounds. The slide show continues to run
	until you click anywhere on an instrument screen.
	
	This option continues to run even if you switch away from Musical Instruments and
	then switch back. For instance, if you choose Random and then switch to the
	Finder, the random slides will still be running when you switch back to Musical
	Instruments.
