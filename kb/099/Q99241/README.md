## Q99241: DoubleSpace User Interface Text Not Visible on Monochrome

	Article: Q99241
	Product(s): Microsoft Disk Operating System
	Version(s): MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 21-NOV-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
	For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.
	
	When you run DoubleSpace on a monochrome video display screen, some text and some
	highlighted screens are not viewable. For example, when you select a menu, you
	may be unable to see the selected command.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	There is no way to directly change the default colors or the video display. To
	work around this problem, use the command-line parameters instead of the
	character-based user interface.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS 6.0, 6.2, and 6.22. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
