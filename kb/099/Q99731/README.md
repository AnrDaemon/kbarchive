	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you install the Windows and MS-DOS 5 Upgrade over MS-DOS 3.3 or higher, the
	setup program may skip the MS-DOS portion of Setup. In this case, Setup
	continues to install Windows. Setup moves from Disk 1 to Disk 3 without changing
	the DOS directory date.
	
	To install the MS-DOS portion of this upgrade, you must tell Setup to install
	MS-DOS only. Once MS-DOS is installed, you can run Setup again to install the
	Windows upgrade.
