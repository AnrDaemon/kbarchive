	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
	   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you send a message created using a Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
	E-form through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, the message may not be
	transferred as expected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem may occur if the -HA command-line parameter is not passed to the
	SMTPGATE program.
	
	The SMTPGATE program -HA command-line option exposes the hidden attachments
	generated by the Microsoft Mail system. These attachments contain information
	about Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects and custom message types
	(WINMAIL.DAT). When this -HA parameter is not specified, the default is to
	remove these attachments when the message is converted to SMTP format.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Because E-forms are defined by custom message types, this information must be
	present for forms to perform properly. To ensure that all message information is
	transferred, you must pass the -HA parameter to the SMTPGATE program.
