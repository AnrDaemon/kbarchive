## Q99697: PC Forms: MS Mail Spooler (Auto) Is Visible

	Article: Q99697

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
	   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start the E-Form Browser (included with version 1.0 of Microsoft
	Electronic Forms Designer) independently of Microsoft Mail or Schedule+, the MS
	Mail Spooler (auto) is visible.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a limitation of Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI). Because
	Mail and Schedule+ are not MAPI applications, this problem does not occur when
	you run either of these programs.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
	Electronic Forms Designer. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
