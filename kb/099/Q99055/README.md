	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
	   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, if you reply to a message
	sent to yourself, the copy you receive in your Inbox incorrectly displays your
	name in single quotation marks. This is inconsistent with the way your name is
	displayed in a standard mail message.
	
	For example, the copy of the message you receive in your Inbox displays your name
	as:
	
	  To: 'Your Name'
	
	A standard mail message displays your name as:
	
	  To: Your Name
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known problem with Simple MAPI trying to resolve the user's name.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
	Electronic Forms Designer. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
