## Q99116: PC WRmt: Incorrect Sorting by Subject

	Article: Q99116
	Product(s): Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.2
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 18-NOV-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When sorting messages by Subject (using the View menu) in version 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, the RE: and FW: header prefixes are not
	ignored, as they are by Microsoft Mail for Windows. This causes all replies and
	forwards to be sorted together.
	
	The sort should ignore the RE: and FW: prefixes so that messages are truly sorted
	by subject.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
	Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
