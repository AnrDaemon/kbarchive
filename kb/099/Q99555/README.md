	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are printing to a Personal LaserWriter LS from FoxBASE+/Mac, the
	descenders on letters that have a line of text below them may be cut off. The
	Personal LaserWriter LS driver version 7.2 corrects this problem.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The "descender" is the portion of a letter that extends below the line of text.
	If a report created in the Report Writer contains multiple-line memo fields or
	SAY or GET fields positioned directly below each other, the descenders of the
	letters on the upper lines may be cut off.
