	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The article on page 106 of the June 7, 1993, issue of InfoWorld states that the
	new DBLSPACE.EXE file is "intended to fix some of those DoubleSpace bugs that
	Microsoft says it hasn't been able to replicate." This statement is incorrect.
	
	The DBLSPACE.EXE file included on the "Conversion Disk for Users of Stacker" has
	no bug fixes or patches. The new DBLSPACE.EXE file contains functionality to
	convert Stacker-compressed volumes to DoubleSpace-compressed volumes. The only
	functionality change is the inclusion of the Stacker conversion routine,
	including the Tools menu option to Convert Stacker and a new /CONVSTAC
	command-line parameter.
