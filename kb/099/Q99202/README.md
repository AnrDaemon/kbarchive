	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows may display messages waiting in
	the Outbox that never get sent.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	These messages are most likely associated with a different mail driver than the
	one you currently are using.
	
	RESOLUTION

	Switch back to the driver you used when you created those messages and they will
	be sent the next time you connect.
	
	Before switching mail drivers, send all your messages to make sure your Outbox is
	empty.

	This situation is documented in the Mail Remote for Windows "User's Guide" in
