	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Web Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is not included with the
	Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5) CD. WBEM will be updated and shipped
	with future WinPack or service pack releases after SP5.
	
	WBEM 1.1 is present in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4 (CD only), and can be
	installed through Wbemcore.exe in the appropriate I386 or Alpha folder.
	
	Installing SP5 will not affect WBEM. The WBEM version will remain at 1.1, and
	WBEM files will not be overwritten. WBEM version 1.1 can still be installed from
	the Service Pack 4 CD after SP5 is installed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Additional information will be posted on www.microsoft.com as it becomes
	available.
	
	WBEM is an industry standard used to allow Internet Web browser-based
	administration of networked computers. WBEM version 1.1 is included with the
	Windows NT Service Pack 4 CD and is located in the WBEM folder. The WBEM
	architecture is built into Windows 98 and will be built into Windows 2000
	Professional and Server to lower the Total Cost of Ownership. WBEM enables
	information to be extracted from client computers regarding hardware
	configuration such as the amount of RAM, processor, Hard disk capacity, and so
	forth. This information is important for decision making and remote management
	by other products such as Systems Management Server.
	
	Information about the Service Pack 4 release of the WBEM version 1.1 protocol set
	may be found at:

	The following is a quote from the Web site:
	
	  "Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provides a bi-directional
	  instrumentation access mechanism. It brings together the management data from
	  the hardware platform, drivers and applications and passes the consolidated
	  data into a consistent management information store. This store, developed to
	  conform to the requirements of the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM)
	  proposals, uses the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF) and Common
	  Information Model (CIM) as the basis for exposing and interacting with this
	  information. CIM and WMI are enabling technologies. Together these core
	  technologies provide a powerful and consistent mechanism enabling management
	  applications, platforms and consoles to perform a wide variety of management
	  tasks on Windows-based hardware and software. (Available on CD-ROM only)"
