	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When your computer requests a Microsoft Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
	name lookup, the primary WINS server may return the following error message:
	
	  Name does not exist
	
	A duplicate query is then sent to the secondary WINS server. However, a delay of
	1500 ms may occur after both the first and second query using the configured
	default in the NameSrvQueryTimeout value in the Windows NT registry. In this
	case, the delay is unnecessary.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
