## Q71614: Minesweeper Will Not Save High Scores

	Article: Q71614

	Last Modified: 30-JUL-2001
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Minesweeper game packaged with the Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP1) won't
	save high scores if you have set a custom grid with which to play, or if you
	have selected Expert level from the Game menu.
	
	Solution
	--------
	
	From the Games Menu, change the color, size, or marks options to save your high
	scores with a custom grid, or with Expert level selected. This rewrites the
	Minesweeper section of the ENTPACK.INI and saves the recorded high scores.
