	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows HPPCL printer driver supports the Okidata LaserLine 6 directly with
	512K of printer memory only. However, Okidata has confirmed that the printer was
	shipped with a standard 128K of internal memory.
	
	It has been reported that using the LaserLine 6, with the HPPCL driver, with only
	the standard 128K results in inaccurate page formatting.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are two possible solutions to this problem:
	
	- Instead of installing for the LaserLine 6, install for an HP LaserJet with
	  128K. Both use the same HPPCL driver. This results in proper output; however,
	  the LaserLine 6's internal helvetica fonts are not available.
	
	-or-
	
	- Contact Okidata and purchase the memory upgrade kit (#7000-9201).
	
	NOTE: Okidata has discontinued production of this printer.
