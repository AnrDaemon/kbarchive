	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Many third-party programs that are used to check Microsoft Word for Windows
	files (such as Grammatik) do not work correctly if the file is saved with a fast
	save, rather than a normal save. A fast save appends changes to a document at
	the end of a file, rather than rearranging the entire file to insert all changes
	every time you save the file.
