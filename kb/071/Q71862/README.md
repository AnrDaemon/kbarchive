	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Brother HL-Series driver version 1.0 (available from the Supplemental Driver
	Library [SDL]) does not support italic format for its resident fonts. Italicized
	characters display as normal format. All other formats work correctly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Brother HL-Series driver offers the following resident fonts:
	
	  Anelia
	  Brougham
	  Letter Gothic
	  BR - 01T
	  BR - 02H
	
	When using any of the resident fonts, italicized characters are displayed and
	printed in normal format. All other font formats (bold, underline, superscript,
	and subscript) work correctly.
	
	Other font selections (modern, roman, script) do not seem to be affected.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
