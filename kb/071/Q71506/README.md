	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Paintbrush program included with Windows version 3.0 cannot rotate a
	graphic 90 degrees. However, Paintbrush can "flip" a graphic, horizontally
	or vertically, and "tilt" a graphic.
	
	When Paintbrush flips a graphic, it makes a mirror image of the
	graphic, based on the horizontal or vertical axis.
	
	A tilted graphic has its base line dragged horizontally to cause the
	graphic to lean (or tilt) at an angle.
	
	For more information, please refer to chapter 8 in the "Microsoft
	Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0.
