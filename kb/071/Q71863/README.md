	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You may have trouble sizing a window or seeing the border colors if the window
	border width or frame is too narrow. The border width can be increased by
	selecting the Desktop icon from the Control Panel and entering the desired width
	in the Border Width field.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The border width sets the width of the borders around all the windows on your
	desktop, except those that have a fixed size (such as Control Panel). The range
	is 1 (narrowest) to 49 (widest).
	
	If your window border colors do not change or appear after you have changed the
	colors by choosing the Color icon from Control Panel and selecting the desired
	color, the border width is probably set to a value that is too narrow to view.
	To resolve this problem, select Desktop from the Control Panel and increase the
	border width until the colors appear.
