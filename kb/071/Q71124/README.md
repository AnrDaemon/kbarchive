	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use Terminal to communicate to a direct connected host machine, such as
	a serial connection to a mainframe, you do not need to dial a number to get a
	connection. Just make sure that the settings and the terminal emulation mode are
	set correctly, then press the ENTER key twice to start the communications.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you use a null modem cable between two PCs, you may need to take the
	following additional steps:
	
	1. Turn Local Echo on or you cannot see what you are typing even though it
	  appears on the other machine.
	
	2. Turn Outbound CR -> CR/LF on, or when you press the ENTER key, it
	  overwrites the last line.
