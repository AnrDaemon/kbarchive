	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you get the Microsoft MS-DOS Packaged Product in the wrong disk size, you can
	obtain the correct media through Microsoft Customer Service by sending in the
	disk set and requesting the other format.
	
	For example, if you purchased the 5.25-inch Microsoft MS-DOS Packaged Product
	version 4.01a for a machine that has only 3.5-inch disk drives, send in the
	5.25-inch disks and request the 3.5-inch disk set.
	
	This information applies only to Microsoft MS-DOS Packaged Product versions
	3.30a, 4.01a, and 5.0.
	
	If you do not have the Microsoft MS-DOS Packaged Product (for example, you have
	COMPAQ MS-DOS), contact your dealer or OEM (original equipment manufacturer).
