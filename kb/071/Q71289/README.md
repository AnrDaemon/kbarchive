	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Two XGA Video Adapters can be used in one Micro Channel machine. However, the
	Microsoft Windows version 3.0 XGA driver that IBM supplies disables one of the
	cards.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use two XGA cards, each must be connected to a different type of monitor (for
	example, a standard VGA monitor on one card and a super VGA monitor on the
	other). Windows uses the monitor that corresponds to the driver installed during
	setup. Your entire session, including Windows and MS-DOS applications that you
	run under Windows, are limited to that one monitor.
	
	If you run applications under native MS-DOS, you can use either monitor,
	depending upon the MS-DOS application's resolution.
