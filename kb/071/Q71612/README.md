	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains information about using the RasterOps Colorboard 1024MC
	color display system with Microsoft Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The RasterOps Colorboard 1024MC is a color display system that offers true
	24-bit color display, which supports up to 16.7 million colors, VGA passthrough
	for VGA application compatibility, and 3 MB of VRAM. It is compatible with the
	IBM RISC 6000 and includes drivers for both Windows 3.0 and OS/2 Presentation
	Manager. A driver for Windows 3.1 is available on the RasterOps BBS. The driver
	is in ZIP format in the IBM PS/2 conference and is named 1024MC31.ZIP. Unzip the
	file and replace your old driver of the same name.
	
	The Colorboard 1024MC is designed for a 16-bit microchannel slot interface and
	has a 1024 x 1024 24-bit frame buffer that allows you to view a high- resolution
	(1024 x 768) true-color picture. VGA passthrough is achieved by using a "live
	scan converter," allowing a VGA screen to be overlaid on top of the 1024 x 768
	image.
	
	A VGA display at a resolution of (640 x 480) can be overlaid on top of the
	true-color image within a window. With a multifrequency monitor, the VGA image
	can be displayed full screen, over the top of the 1024 x 768 image, or within a
	smaller window. Without a multifrequency monitor, the VGA image can only be in a
	window.
