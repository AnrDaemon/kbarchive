	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Norton Utilities, version 4.0 and earlier, does not recognize partitions greater
	than 32 megabytes. Symantec Technical Support has confirmed this behavior.
	
	This is not a problem with MS-DOS. The method of creating partitions changed from
	MS-DOS version 3.3 to MS-DOS 4.0. Customers with this problem must call Symantec
	and request an upgrade.
	
	The Norton Untilities product included here is manufactured by Symantec, a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	this product's performance or reliability.
