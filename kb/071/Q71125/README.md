	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Search Entire Disk option in File Manager's Search dialog box causes File
	Manager to search the entire partition, not the entire disk. For example, if you
	want to search partitions C, D, and E, you need to perform a separate search for
	each partition.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	On page 124 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide," step 4 states that after
	you select the Search Entire Disk check box, "File Manager will search the
	entire disk drive." This is incorrect.
