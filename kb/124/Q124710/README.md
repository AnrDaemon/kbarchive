	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Human Body for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install The Magic School Bus Explores The Human Body and configure
	your Gravis UltraSound sound card for Extended MIDI, you do not hear MIDI drum
	sound, either in the program or in the Bus Stop Utility.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Rather than using FM synthesis, the Gravis UltraSound implements MIDI sound via
	a series of patch maps. These patch maps, which it loads by default, do not
	include the correct drum sounds.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
