	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Windows NT version 3.1 provided support for the STB Powergraph X-24,
	Powergraph VL-24 and WIND/X HC video cards with the S3 driver. Due to
	changes made to the S3 driver in Windows NT version 3.5, these video cards
	are no longer supported.
	
	STB recently released a Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51 video drivers for
	STB's S3-based video cards, such as the Powergraph X-24, Powergraph VL-24,
	and Pegasus VL. The drivers are available on the Graphics A Vendor forum
	(GO STBSYS) on CompuServe. Download S3NT35.ZIP for Windows NT 3.5 and
	download SBTNT351.ZIP for Windows NT 3.51. For additional information, call
	STB Technical Support at (800) 234-4334 or (214) 234-8750.
	
	The Windows NT 3.51 video driver included in SBTNT351.ZIP does not support
	the WIND/X HC video card (as noted in README.TXT). This video card works
	with the Windows NT 3.51 S3 video driver.
	
	The STB product discussed here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
	product's performance or reliability.
