	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This configuration, in accordance with the Intel SMP 1.0 specification, requires
	that the second Pentium chip be designed to be used as a second processor. You
	cannot use two primary Pentium chips. If you purchased the computer with only
	one Pentium chip and you plan to obtain a second processor, check with the
	manufacturer for availability. If you have the two Pentium chips properly
	installed, the BIOS reports "Number of processors 2" when you start the
	computer.
	
	This configuration also requires an Award BIOS revision level 0303 or later.
	Check the CMOS setup to determine your version.
