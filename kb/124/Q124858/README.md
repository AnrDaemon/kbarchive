	Windows NT Program Manager limits the number of personal and common groups
	to 40 each (80 groups total). Each program group limits the number of
	program items to 50.
	
	If you have 40 common groups and try to add another, the following error
	message appears:
	
	  You have created the maximum number of common groups possible in Program
	  Manager. To create a new group you must first delete a common group to make
	  room.
	
	If a program group contains 50 items and you try to add another, the
	following error message appears:
	
	  This program group already contains the maximum number of items.
