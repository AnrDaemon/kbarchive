## Q124803: QIC Tape with Multiple Backups Sets, Only First Set Displayed

	Article: Q124803
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 3.5
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows NT Backup displays only the first backup set on a QIC tape with multiple
	backup sets. Once this problem has occurred, it is not possible to restore data
	from the missing sets.
	
	QIC-40 or QIC-80 tape drives that create multiple backup sets occasionally have
	difficulty cataloging the tapes or detecting backup sets beyond the first one
	present on the tape. The Arcada Backup Exec package does not exhibit this
	problem because it stores catalog information on the disk.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
