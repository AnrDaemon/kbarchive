	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Most images in Microsoft Encarta for Windows have the Print and Copy options,
	but some images do not. This is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following types of images do not have the Print and Copy options:
	
	- Charts and tables that have scroll bars
	
	- Population and climate charts
	
	- Other charts or tables when accessed through Media Gallery, when enlarged
	
	- Videos
	
	- Animation, when enlarged
	
	- Compound pictures, when enlarged
	
	Although many charts and tables can be printed from the article, you cannot print
	them if you are viewing them through Media Gallery.
	
	Compound pictures (such as Types Of Bird Nests, located in the Bird article) can
	be printed at the small size, or they can be enlarged and you can print the
	individual images.
