	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright will not run on the Windows NT platform.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	One of the minimum requirements listed on the box is "Microsoft Windows version
	3.1 or later." Windows NT is a substantially different from Windows 3.1, and,
	therefore, Frank Lloyd Wright does not run on it. Frank Lloyd Wright Setup may
	run successfully, but the application will not start. This is a limitation of
	Frank Lloyd Wright and not of Windows NT.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright
	version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
