	Article: Q124132

	Version(s): 2.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you move the mouse cursor over the Top View window in Golf 2.0, the Top
	View screen moves in the direction the mouse is moving, even if you are not
	holding down the mouse button.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This type of behavior has been encountered while running the After Dark screen
	saver program. Typically, this behavior occurs when you move the mouse, or type
	the password to disengage the screen saver, and then move the mouse over the Top
	View window.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Minimize and then immediately maximize Golf 2.0 to alleviate the problem.
	
	STEPS TO REPRODUCE PROBLEM
	--------------------------
	
	1. Start Golf 2.0 and begin a new round or open a saved round.
	
	2. Double-click the Top View icon (move this window to a desired location on the
	  Golf 2.0 desktop, if necessary).
	
	3. Make sure the After Dark screen saver has been loaded, and then allow it to
	  engage.
	
	4. Return to the game by moving the mouse, or typing the password, to disengage
	  the screen saver.
	
	5. Move the mouse so that the cursor sweeps over the Top View window. The
	  terrain in the Top View window moves in the same direction the mouse moved
	  over it.
