	If you use the Secret Agent tool to create a password for a document, pictures
	and text are not intelligible when you open the document later. To see the

	password, Creative Writer provides a way to decode the document.

	steps:

	2. Choose Secret Agent.
	
	3. Type "Detective McZee to the rescue" (without the quotation marks).
