	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Dialing Properties is designed to automatically add a "1" before a telephone
	number that has an area code different from your own. You do not need to add the
	"1" manually.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Dialing Properties, you use the entries in the "How I dial from this
	location" (When Dialing From Here in Windows 98) box to specify a number for
	reaching an outside telephone line. For example, if your company requires that
	you dial a "9" to reach an outside telephone line, type "9" (without quotation
	marks) in both "To access outside line, first dial..." boxes. Do not type a "1"
	in either of these boxes. If you do not need to dial a number to reach an
	outside telephone line, leave these boxes empty.
