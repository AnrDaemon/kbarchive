	A shortcut from the desktop to The Microsoft Network provides a direct
	link to a folder or service. To delete one shortcut, right-click the
	shortcut and then click Delete on the menu that appears. To delete multiple
	shortcuts simultaneously, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
	
	2. In the Named box, type "*.mcc" (without quotation marks).
	
	3. Click the Find Now button to find all your shortcuts to The Microsoft
	  Network.
	
	4. In the list of files that appears, select all the shortcut files that you
	  want to delete. To select multiple files, press and hold down the SHIFT key
	  while you click the files. To select files that are not next to each other in
	  the list, press and hold down the CTRL key while you click the files.
	
	5. On the File menu, click Delete.
