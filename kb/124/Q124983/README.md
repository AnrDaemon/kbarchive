	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Images in Encarta appear blurred and grainy if your screen is set to display
	images in 16 shades of gray; however, in the Finder, these same images look
	clearer. For example, in the article that discusses Roh Te Woo, note that the
	picture is blurred and grainy. However, if you switch to the Finder, the picture
	of Roh Te Woo is clearer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Encarta is designed to run best in 256 colors or shades of gray. In fact, when
	you first start Encarta, it will recommend that you display images in 256
	colors. The quality of images at resolutions fewer than 256 colors are not very
	clear.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To switch to 256 colors or shades of gray, choose Control Panels from the Apple
	menu, and choose the Monitors control panel. (Note that you must have a monitor
	that is capable of displaying 256 colors for this option to be available.)
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If your computer is displaying images in 16 shades of gray, Encarta changes the
	palette by adding an extra shade of black.
	
	This problem was corrected in Encarta 1995.
