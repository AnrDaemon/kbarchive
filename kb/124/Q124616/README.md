	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use a single window to browse folders in MSN, The Microsoft Network and
	change the size of the window, the window returns to its original size when you
	return to MSN Central.
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can browse folders in The Microsoft Network using either separate windows
	for each folder or a single window that changes as you open each folder. To set
	this option, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, click Options.
	
	2. Click the Folder tab.
	
	3. Click the browsing option you want, and then click OK.
	
	If you use a single window to browse folders and change the window's size, the
	window will return to its original size when you return to MSN Central. Note
	that clicking the window's Close button does not return you to MSN Central, but
	closes the window. You must then double-click the MSN icon to open MSN Central.
	To return directly to MSN Central, click The Microsoft Network in the Go To A
	Different Folder box on the toolbar. To display the toolbar, click Toolbar on
	the View menu.
