	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Vacuum Tool in Fine Artist, and you have installed the
	MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum Sound Card, the computer may stop responding
	(hang). (For similar behavior in Creative Writer, see the More Information
	section.)
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Contact Media Vision for an updated driver:
	
	  Media Vision, Inc. (510) 770-9905
	
	If you are using a Pro Audio Spectrum driver, but are unsure about which version
	you are using, see your Windows printed documentation or online Help for
	information about how to determine your driver in Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Vacuum Tool uses a cyclic sound, rather than a short sound, which, when used
	in conjunction with the Pro Audio Spectrum Sound Card and some versions of the
	Pro Audio sound driver, can cause the computer to hang.
	
	NOTE: If you experience this problem when using Creative Writer with a Sound
	Blaster 16 card, change the HDMA setting to DMA. You can do this by using the SB
	Configuration icon found in the Sound Blaster 16 program group. When you run
	this icon, it displays the DMA and HDMA settings. Change the HDMA setting to
	DMA.
