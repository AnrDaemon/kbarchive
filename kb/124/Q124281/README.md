	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you compose a message on a Bulletin Board Service (BBS) and type a subject
	in the Subject area, the subject you typed also appears in the message's title
	bar.
	
	If you use a tab character in the message subject, the tab character appears as
	spaces in the Subject area and as a pipe character (|) in the message's title
	bar. For example, the subject
	
	  "<tab character>This is the subject"
	
	appears in the Subject area as
	
	  "     This is the subject"
	
	and in the title bar as:
	
	  "|This is the subject"
