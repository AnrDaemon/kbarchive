	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows Command Line allows Windows programs to make calls from macros to
	SourceSafe. All output, however, will be generated in Windows' output windows,
	instead of MS-DOS sessions.
	
	SSWCL.EXE is the Windows Command Line executable. Use it as you use SS.EXE on the
	other SourceSafe platforms. For example:
	
	  SSWCL create $/myproject
	
	NOTE: It cannot be executed from a MS-DOS session.
	
	Refer to the Microsoft Command Line Reference more information on SourceSafe
	command and command line syntax.
