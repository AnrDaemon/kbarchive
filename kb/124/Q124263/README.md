	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There is currently no Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) client for the
	Macintosh available. However, Macintosh clients can dial in using a Point-
	to-Point Protocol (PPP) client software on the Macintosh, or dial in to an Apple
	Remote Access server on the network.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some Common PPP client packages available for the Macintosh are:
	
	- FreePPP (shareware update of MacPPP)
	
	- OpenTransport PPP from Apple
	
	
	When dialing in using Apple Remote Access software, you must install the Apple
	Remote Access server on a Macintosh connected to the network. Apple Remote
	Access software does not integrate with Microsoft RAS software and uses a
	different modem line. However, you can connect to a Windows NT Server version
	3.5 using Microsoft authentication using Chooser.
