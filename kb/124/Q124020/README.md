	- Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky, The Rite of Spring, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Beethoven: The Ninth Symphony, versions 1.0, 1.1 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart, The Dissonant Quartet, version 1.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have a 256-color bitmap displayed as your backdrop in Windows, you may
	find that areas of it become blacked out or change color after you have opened
	and closed a secondary window in any of the composer titles listed at the top of
	this article. For example, after you close Help, the Glossary, the Game Entry
	form, or the Find dialog box in Schubert, you may find that the area of the
	bitmap that was underneath the dialog box looks strange or is black.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the composer titles listed at the
	top of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
