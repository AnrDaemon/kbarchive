	- Microsoft Complete Basketball, version '94-'95 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use a Microsoft Windows color scheme that uses white text, text
	characters displayed on a white background in Microsoft Complete Baseball or
	Microsoft Complete Basketball will be missing.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Do not use a Windows color scheme that uses white text (such as the Plasma Power
	Saver color scheme). Since Microsoft Complete Baseball and Microsoft Complete
	Basketball display text on a white background, white text will disappear.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To change the Windows color scheme you are using, follow these steps:
	
	1. Double-click the Control Panel icon in the Main program group.
	
	2. Double-click the Color icon.
	
	3. In the Color Schemes box, select a scheme that does not use white text. For
	  example, the Windows Default scheme does not use white text.
	
	4. Choose the OK button.
