	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of Nature for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of People for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains a description of the settings that you can change from
	within Explorapedia.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following describes the behavior of each of the common Explorapedia
	settings:
	
	- Never Mind returns you to the ship.
	
	- Go Back returns you to the previous dialog box.
	
	- Selecting the On or Off buttons, a text color, or the painting or writing
	  application returns you to the Settings dialog box.
	
	In the Spaceship, click the Settings button. Tad asks which settings you want to
	change. The settings you can change are:
	
	- Sounds
	
	- Color Of Leap Words
	
	- Scene Actions
	
	- Connections To Writing Or Painting Programs
	
	- Never Mind
	
	NOTE: Explorapedia World of People introduces the ability to turn on or off
	Little Kids Mode. Little Kids Mode allows you to click on the Scene Actions and
	see the actions only. When Little Kids Mode is off, when you click on a Scene
	Action, the action occurs, then you go straight to the topic that you clicked
	on. If you install People as well as Nature, then Little Kids Mode is available
	as an option in Nature, as well.
	
	Sounds
	------
	
	Tad asks which sounds you want to turn on or off:
	
	- Tad's Voice
	
	- Reading Explorapedia Out Loud
	
	- All Sounds
	
	- Never Mind
	
	If you select one of the first three options, Tad takes you to the next dialog
	box, where your choices are: On, Off, Go Back, and Never Mind.
	
	Color of Leap Words
	-------------------
	
	Leap words are highlighted words within a topic that, when clicked, take you to
	the leap word topic. Your choices are:
	
	- Blue
	
	- Red
	
	- Green
	
	- Brown
	
	- Go Back
	
	- Never Mind
	
	Scene Actions
	-------------
	
	If you would like to move around a little faster, you might want to turn the
	scene actions off. The scene actions occur when you click an animal or object in
	a scene. Your choices are:
	
	- Turn Scene Actions On
	
	- Turn Scene Actions Off
	
	- Go Back
	
	- Never Mind
	
	Connections to Writing or Painting Programs
	-------------------------------------------
	
	Your choices are:
	
	- A Painting Program
	
	- A Writing Program
	
	- Go Back
	
	- Never Mind
	
	If you choose to connect to another program, you get a Windows dialog box, which
	lets you select any .EXE file you desire. By default, it displays the Windows
	directory, which is where WRITE.EXE, NOTEPAD.EXE, and PBRUSH.EXE are located.
	You can select any one of these, or others as long as the file has a filename
	that ends in .EXE.
