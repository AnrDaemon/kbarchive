	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses the difference between the ODBC Access driver that ships
	with Microsoft Office Professional/Microsoft Access version 2.0 and the Access
	driver that ships with the ODBC Desktop Database Drivers version 2.0/ODBC
	Software Development Kit (SDK) version 2.10.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The ODBC Access driver, included in Microsoft Office Professional version 4.3
	and Microsoft Access version 2.0, is intended to be used only from within
	Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel to get to Microsoft Access 2.0 databases. The
	use of this driver from any other application is not supported. This driver
	cannot be redistributed with any other application.
	
	To get the general purpose ODBC Access driver for Microsoft Access 2.0 databases,
	you need to have ODBC Desktop Database Drivers version 2.0.
	
	The Microsoft Windows Driver Library (WDL) is available on online services. For
	more information about the WDL, see the following article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base.
