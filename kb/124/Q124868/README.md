	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Cinemania 1995 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Basic system requirements are listed on the back of the Microsoft Cinemania 1995
	box. Some boxes incorrectly state that a VGA or higher monitor is required. The
	correct requirement is a Super VGA or higher monitor (256-color).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you try to install Cinemania with a video driver not compliant with the
	system requirements, Setup returns the following message:
	
	  Setup has detected that your computer is missing one or more of the necessary
	  components for enjoying the full range of features of Microsoft Cinemania
	  '95.
	
	  For information on the problem and how to correct it, click Help. When you're
	  ready to continue setup, click OK.
	
	  Microsoft Cinemania '95 requires a 256 color display.
	
	The options are OK and Help. If you click Help, you are referred to the Windows
	documentation. If you click OK, the Cinemania '95 installation is completed.
	Attempting to run Cinemania '95 fails with the following error message:
	
	  Cinemania '95 can run only on a display with 256 or more colors. For details
	  on changing display settings, see your Windows documentation or the
	  documentation that came with your video card.
	
	The README.TXT file incorrectly states that you can run Cinemania '95 with fewer
	than 256 colors:
	
	Running in less than 256 colors will result in poor screen graphics
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	The printing on newer boxes has been corrected to include the correct display
	requirements. The README.TXT file still contains incorrect system requirement
	information.
