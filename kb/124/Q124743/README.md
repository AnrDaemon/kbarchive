## Q124743: Cannot Manually Define Baud Rate for COM Ports

	Article: Q124743

	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you manually define a baud rate for one of the communication ports (COMx,
	where x is the number of ports on your computer) in Control Panel by typing in
	the baud rate value, the baud rate is changed to first value on the drop-down
	list, which is 75. For example, if you define the COM1 port to a baud rate of
	28800, the next time you select Settings in the Ports dialog box, the baud rate
	is changed to 75.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, select an already-defined baud rate in the
	drop-down list.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
