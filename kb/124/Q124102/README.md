	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you receive an "Out of paper" message and refill the paper tray on a
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 560c, the printer still does not print. Clicking
	Retry in the message box does not restart the printer; instead, the message is
	repeated.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is caused by the capabilities of the DeskJet 560c printer. This
	printer does not automatically start after the paper tray is refilled.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To start the printer, press the Load/Eject button on the printer. The job, and
	any subsequent jobs, then prints.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior has also been reported to occur with the HP LaserJet 5MP.
