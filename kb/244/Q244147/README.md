	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the Spot Plane view to look at your aircraft, the shadow of your
	aircraft is not displayed. In addition, when you fly through a city, the shadows
	of buildings are not displayed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior is by design. This issue can be resolved by installing the latest
	FS2000 update. You may find this update at this web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/games/fs2000
	
	Flight Simulator now includes shadows for aircraft, buildings, and dynamic
	scenery. The complete redesign of the scenery system in Flight Simulator 2000
	made the previous method of displaying shadows obsolete. To view shadows, make
	sure that the Aircraft Shadows and Ground Scenery Shadows settings are selected
	in the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings dialog box. To get to this
	dialog box in Flight Simulator, point to Options, point to Settings, and then
	click Display. Then click the Image Quality tab.
