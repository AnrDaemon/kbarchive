	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Windows 98 Beta Release is a time-limited program. After a date
	preprogrammed into the system, the Windows 98 Beta Release operating system will
	no longer load. Install the full version of Windows 98 to remove the time
	limitation.
	
	The CD-ROM label and Betagide.doc file state that the expiration date is December
	31, 1998. However, the release notes (Relnotes.doc) included on the CD-ROM state
	that the expiration date is August 24, 1998.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The correct expiration date is December 31, 1998. Windows 98 will begin warning
	you in November 1998 that your system is due to expire shortly.
	
	Note that support for the Windows 98 Beta Release expired on June 25, 1998, when
	the release version of Microsoft Windows 98 first appeared in stores. Support is
	no longer available for this product.
	
	For more information, please see the Betagide.doc file in the root directory of
	the Windows 98 Resource Kit CD-ROM.
