	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using Exchanger Server 5.0 or 5.5 and you connect to the server
	with a POP3 client, you may see the following error message:
	
	  -ERR Ambiguous Alias
	
	This error message is generated by the Exchange Server computer if the mailbox
	used by the POP3 client has an alias that matches another alias homed on that
	specific server. The same error message may also appear when mailboxes with
	matching alias names are located in separate recipient containers of the same
	Exchange Server computer.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The administrator of the Exchange Server computer can resolve this problem by
	changing the alias of the mailbox to a different name.
