	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Systems Management Server Inventory Agent reports the client's inventory by
	creating a TMP file and placing it in the Inventry.box directory of the client's
	Systems Management Server logon server. The TMP file is then converted to a RAW
	file and moved to the Systems Management Server site server computer.
	
	NetWare Systems Management Server clients may receive the following error message
	during inventory processing:
	
	  Error opening file SYS:SMS\logon.srv\inventry.box\<file name>.tmp
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The NetShield virus-detection software running on the Systems Management Server
	NetWare logon server may cause this problem. The NetShield software opens the
	TMP files to check for viruses which causes the Systems Management Server client
	to fail when it opens that same file.
	
	In a Network Monitor trace, you see a number of Out Of Handles returned error
	messages generated by the Systems Management Server NetWare logon server. The
	NCP reply contains the following message:
	
	  NCP: Completion Code = Lock Fail
	
	To work around the problem, you can disable the NetShield virus software from the
	NetWare Systems Management Server logon server.
