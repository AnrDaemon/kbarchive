	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use, test, or calibrate the CH Virtual Pilot Pro joystick or the CH
	F-16 Combatstick joystick in one of the Microsoft programs listed above, some
	joystick buttons or features may not function properly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because the CH Virtual Pilot Pro and the CH F-16
	Combatstick require an updated driver to provide joystick features to games that
	are not designed specifically for these devices.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this behavior, download and install the most recent version of the
	Virtual Pilot Pro driver or the F-16 Combatstick driver for Windows 95 from the
	following CH Products Web site:
