## Q181960: XCLN: Macintosh Does Not Correctly Support Adobe.pdf Attachments

	Article: Q181960

	Version(s): MACINTOSH:4.0,5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 02-APR-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you send an Adobe Acrobat.pdf file as an attachment from an Exchange
	Macintosh client, the attachment is unusable when received by any other Exchange
	or MS Mail client.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The .pdf file is not recognized by the Macintosh Exchange client and is modified
	to be a generic MacBinary attachment. This results in the attachment being
	received with a generic icon (usually a Macintosh computer icon) and is not
	useable even when saved locally.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be problem in Exchange Client versions 4.0 and
	5.0 for Macintosh. This problem was corrected in Exchange Client 5.0 Service
	Pack 1.
