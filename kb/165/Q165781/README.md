	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you view your document, you may see PRIVATE fields, as in the following
	example:
	
	  {PRIVATE}
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word uses the PRIVATE field to store data for documents converted from
	other file formats. Word inserts a PRIVATE field when converting file formats;
	the PRIVATE field contains data needed for converting a document back to its
	original file format. If the document will not be used in its original
	application again, then you can delete the PRIVATE fields.
	
	A PRIVATE field is formatted as hidden text and doesn't affect the document
	layout in Word when Display Hidden Text is turned off.
	
	To Turn the "Display Hidden Text" Option Off
	--------------------------------------------
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Options.
	
	2. On the View tab, click to clear the "Hidden Text" check box, and then click
	  OK.
