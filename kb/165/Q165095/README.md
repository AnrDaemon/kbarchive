	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	This problem occurs when you save a submitted item that was generated using the
	Microsoft Forms Designer for Microsoft Exchange Server. When you delete data
	from a required field, no warning is given and the item is saved. Additionally,
	when you enter an incorrect data type in a field, there is no apparent problem.
	However, in both cases, the item is saved with no text or data.
	
	This behavior only occurs with items that have already been submitted and are
	being modified and saved again. New forms that have required fields or require a
	specific data type cannot be sent or posted without satisfying those
	requirements.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in of Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
