	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A clip art picture may lose all or part of an object when you edit it in the
	Word Picture Editor.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Some text boxes in the Windows Metafile (WMF) graphic file are computed by the
	picture editor to be too narrow resulting in text wrapping incorrectly in the
	text box.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, edit and ungroup the picture. Then select and
	resize the object that contains the missing components.
	
	For more information about editing clip art, click the Office Assistant, type
	"How do I edit a picture?" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and then
	click to view "Ungroup and modify clip art."
	
	NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
	Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
