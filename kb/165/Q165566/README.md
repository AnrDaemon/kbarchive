	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Word displays text as it will look when printed and doesn't use formatting codes
	to indicate formatting. To easily check document formatting, Word provides a
	tool for viewing how text is formatted, called "What's This?"
	
	To check the formats of a particular character or paragraph, click "What's This?"
	on the Help menu (or press SHIFT+F1). When the insertion point becomes a
	question mark, click the text you want to check. When you finish checking your
	text, press ESC.
	
	For more information about "What's This?", click the Office Assistant, type "How
	do I check format settings," click Search, and then click to view "About viewing
	format settings."
	
	NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
	Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
	see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
