	incorrect tip is:
	
	  A speedier way: To jump quickly to a page, double-click a page number in the

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In earlier versions of Word, you can double-click a page number inside a table
	of contents and Word jumps to that page of your document.
	
	In Word 97, this has changed. You no longer double-click the page number inside
	the table of contents; you click (single-click) the page number. If you move
	your pointer over a page number inside the table of contents, the pointer
	changes to a hand. Click the page number and Word takes you to that page.
