	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you replace an existing serial mouse with a Microsoft Mouse Port mouse
	connected to a serial adapter, the driver tab in Control Panel shows the mouse
	as "Unknown" and the Change button is unavailable.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows NT cannot detect the mouse type properly through the serial adapter.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A serial adapter is a device that permits a Mouse Port mouse to be used from a
	serial port.
	
	To determine if your mouse is using such an adapter, examine the connection to
	the computer. A Mouse Port mouse has a round plug on the end of the cable. If
	your mouse has such a plug and is plugged into another connector that is not
	round, your mouse is using a serial adapter.
