	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Paragraphs that are formatted with bullets and numbering formatting appear to be
	misaligned in the Document Map. These paragraphs appear to be aligned correctly
	in other views, such as normal view or page layout view. This problem is
	especially apparent if you are using the Windows NT version 3.51 operating
	system.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Document Map pane uses a space to separate the bullet or number from the
	paragraph text. Other views use a tab.
	
	The Document Map pane does not use a tab for the bullet or number alignment
	because the tab stop would have to be able to accommodate varying fonts and
	sizes. This could consume a large amount of space in the Document Map pane, and
	could make it difficult to read the text in the Document Map.
