	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you print Notes pages or Handouts, a frame may print around the page, even
	though you do not select the Frame Slides option in the Print dialog box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This occurs if you have Pure Black and White selected in the Print dialog box.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent the frame from printing, change the Black and White settings for the
	background of the Notes Master and Handouts Master. To do this, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, point to Master, and then click Notes Master.
	
	2. On the View menu, click Black and White.
	
	3. Right-click the background of the Master, point to Black and White, and then
	  click White.
	
	If you intend to print handouts without frames, repeat the above steps
	substituting Handouts Master for Notes Master in step 1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Every object in a presentation has specific black and white settings for print
	jobs sent to a black and white printer. This includes the backgrounds in the
	Notes Master and the Handouts Master.
