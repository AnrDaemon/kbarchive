	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you delete or change a numbered or bulleted list when Track Changes is on,
	you may receive unexpected results.
	
	Case 1
	------
	
	If you delete a numbered list item with Track Changes on, the revised text is
	struck through and appears with the number followed immediately by the text
	without any indentation.
	
	Case 2
	------
	
	If you delete a bulleted list item with Track Changes on, the revised text is
	struck-through and appears with a square (instead of the bullet) followed
	immediately by the text without the indentation.
	
	Case 3
	------
	
	If you change a number or bullet format to a Wingding bullet format with Track
	Changes on, the revised text is struck-through and appears with one or two
	random struck-through Wingding characters preceding your actual bullet.
	
	NOTE: This behavior is different from earlier versions of Word.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you undo the change or if you accept or reject the change, Word corrects
	
	the problem and shows the text with the bullet or number properly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word.
