## Q165856: XCLN: Messages Dragged from Client to Desktop Overlap

	Article: Q165856
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,8.01; Win95:4.0,5.0
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.01 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you move multiple messages from Microsoft Exchange Client or Outlook to the
	Windows NT or Windows 95 desktop using a drag-and-drop operation, the moved or
	copied messages appear on top of one another on the desktop. Also, during the
	copy operation, while the cursor is over the Exchange Client window, it appears
	as the "normal select" cursor and not a "busy" or "working in background"
	cursor.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	There is currently no means of changing the behavior of the cursor during the
	copy/move operation. To prevent copied messages from overlapping on the
	desktop:
	
	- Using a drag-and-drop operation, manually arrange the messages.
	
	-OR-
	
	- Have Windows NT or Windows 95 arrange the messages for you; right-click the
	  open desktop, select Arrange Icons, and then select one of the available
	  commands (by Name, by Type, Auto Arrange, and so on).
	
	NOTE: This problem does not occur when you move messages to a folder on the
	desktop. In this case, the folder arranges the messages according to whatever
	properties have been set on the folder.
