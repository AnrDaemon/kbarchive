	- Microsoft Clip Gallery 3.0 for Windows 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view an image preview in the Microsoft Clip Gallery, the path and file
	name for the selected image is not displayed under the image.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs if you install the Microsoft Clip Gallery component of
	Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, and then attempt to insert clip art into any
	Microsoft program.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design of the Clip Gallery in Microsoft Office 97.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior differs from earlier versions of the Microsoft ClipArt Gallery, in
	which the path name and file name are displayed under the preview image.
	
	This behavior can also affect other Microsoft programs that use earlier versions
	of the Microsoft ClipArt Gallery. Note that you are automatically upgraded to
	the Microsoft Clip Gallery when you install Microsoft Office 97 for Windows.
