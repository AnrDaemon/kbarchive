	Microsoft Graph 8.0 that ships with Microsoft Office 97 exposes the DataSheet to
	OLE automation. The Graphsmp form, which is available for download, is an
	example of how to use OLE automation to change values in the Graph 8.0
	DataSheet. The sample uses the TestData database (Vfp\Samples\Data) that ships
	with Visual FoxPro. It uses the Employee and Order tables to chart the total
	yearly and quarterly sales for each salesperson. For more information on doing
	OLE automation to Microsoft Graph 8.0 please see the Vbagrp8.hlp file that ships
	with Microsoft Office 97.
