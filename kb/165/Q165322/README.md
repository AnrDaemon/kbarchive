	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When you use the ComboBox field for the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, the
	value in the field may not be saved correctly after the item is sent or posted.
	This behavior is most likely to occur when you type values to find a match in
	the available items in the ComboBox list.
	
	For example, in the Category list category list for the ComboBox, you type the
	letters Bu to match an item called "Business." When the message is received, the
	item will have the selection of "Bu" instead of "Business."
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
