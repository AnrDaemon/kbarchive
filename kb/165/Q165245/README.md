	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A DDE client application may experience intermittent DDE disconnect problems.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	XTYP_DISCONNECT message is sent by DDEML to the client application under the
	following scenario:
	
	1. Server is generating frequent calls to DdePostAdvise() on a single data item.
	
	2. Client is making frequent requests to advise/unadvise on the same item.
	
	The client transactions must be of type
	
	  XTYP_ADVSTART | XTYPF_ADVREQ and XTYP_ADVSTOP.
	  (Hot links of type XTYP_ADVSTART do not exhibit this problem.)
	
	Under these circumstances, when a data packet is generated by the server after
	DDEML is notified by the client of a request to unadvise but prior to the
	generation of the ACK for this unadvise, DDEML sends a message of type
	XTYP_DISCONNECT to the client.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
	4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
