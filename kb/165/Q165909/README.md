	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Form fields can not be edited in Word Viewer 97-2000. When you try to change a
	text box form field, you get the error message:
	
	  Word Viewer cannot edit a document.
	
	NOTE: Check box and drop-down form fields function normally. Note also that this
	behavior is different from Word Viewer for Windows 95 version 7.0.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This functionality is by design. Word Viewer is only for viewing and printing
	Word documents. To edit a document, you must use Microsoft Word.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you have Microsoft Word installed on your computer, you can edit the document
	in Word. In Word Viewer 97-2000, on the File menu, click Open for Editing.
	
	This starts Microsoft Word, loads the document, and allows you to make changes.
