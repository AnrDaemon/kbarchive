	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have Outline Numbering applied to a Word 97 document and you format page
	breaks, section breaks, or column breaks as a heading style, then when you open
	the file in Word 7.0, Heading Numbering may be incorrectly applied to the breaks
	instead of the text near the breaks.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a limitation in the Word 7.0 heading numbering feature.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Format the break with a different style, such as Normal.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Word 7.0, there are some situations where a break formatted with a heading
	style takes on heading numbering. This problem was corrected in Word 97;
	however, when you save as Word 6.0 from Word 97 and then open the file in Word
	7.0, the heading numbering may be incorrectly applied to the breaks.
