	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When applying borders to multiple paragraphs to which you have
	
	- included an inside border (a border between paragraphs)
	
	  -and-
	
	- set a distance from text for the Bottom border,
	
	the distance from text is not applied to the inside border--although the preview
	for From Text (Border and Shading Options) indicates the specified distance from
	the text will be applied.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To achieve the same result as setting a distance from text for borders between
	paragraphs, apply separate borders to each paragraph and set the top and bottom
	space for the From Text value to the desired distance.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For a group of selected paragraphs, you can set a top, bottom, left, right, and
	a between border. For top, bottom, left, and right borders, you can specify the
	distance from text. However, you cannot set a distance from text for the border
	between paragraphs.
