	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When trying to run Pstat.exe from the Windows NT Resource Kit version 4.0 on a
	DEC Alpha computer the following error message appears:
	
	  The procedure entry point "RtlTimeToElapsedTimeFields" was not found in the
	  dynamic link library "NTDLL.DLL". Because of this, the image
	  "D:\Winnt\Profiles\Tracey\Desktop\Pstat.exe" could not be loaded and
	  initialized. Perhaps there is an installation or version compatiblity problem
	  between these images? Please check this application's installation.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
