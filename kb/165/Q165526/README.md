	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you look at a document in Online Layout view, Word will report a different
	number of pages in the document than it does when you look at the document in
	another view, such as Normal, Page Layout, Outline, or Master Document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Word paginates the document differently in Online Layout view to optimize the
	view for the window size.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you require a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) view of your document so
	that what you see on the screen will match what is printed, switch to another
	view, such as Page Layout.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This functionality is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The size of the document window will determine the number of pages when you are
	viewing the document in Online view. Making the document window larger will
	decrease the number of pages reported in Online view.
