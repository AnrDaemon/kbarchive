	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you create a custom numbering scheme using the Bullets and Numbering dialog
	box, Word will replace the selected gallery position with your custom numbering
	scheme. This custom numbering scheme will be available in the Bullets and
	Numbering dialog box even after you quit and restart Word.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Bullets And Numbering dialog box includes a gallery of bullet and numbering
	previews (available when you click Bullets and Numbering on the Format menu).
	
	To create a custom bullet or numbering scheme, use one of the following methods.
	
	Method 1: Use Direct Formatting
	-------------------------------
	
	1. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering.
	
	2. Click the appropriate tab (Bulleted, Numbered, Outline Numbered).
	
	3. Click one of the seven gallery previews closest to the scheme you want to
	  create.
	
	4. Click Customize and modify the scheme to fit your needs.
	
	Method 2: Format the Style
	--------------------------
	
	1. On the Format menu, click Style.
	
	2. Click the Modify button.
	
	3. Click the Format button, and click Numbering.
	
	4. Click the Bulleted, Numbered, or Outline Numbered tab.
	
	5. Click one of the seven gallery previews closest to the scheme you want to
	  create.
	
	6. Click the Customize button to modify the scheme to fit your needs.
	
	This will create a custom scheme that will be visible in the Bullets And
	Numbering dialog box until:
	
	- The scheme is overwritten by another custom scheme.
	
	  - or -
	
	- All seven previews in the gallery are in use for custom schemes and Word uses
	  the "AutoFormat As You Type" feature to apply a bullet or number. In this
	  case, the oldest scheme in the gallery is replaced with the scheme that is
	  currently being applied using the AutoFormat feature.
	
	How Do I Get Rid of a Custom Scheme?
	------------------------------------
	
	To get rid of a custom scheme, use the following steps:
	
	1. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering.
	
	2. Click the appropriate tab (Bulleted, Numbered, Outline Numbered).
	
	3. Click the custom scheme you want to remove, and then click Reset.
	
	The scheme will be reset to the default scheme.
