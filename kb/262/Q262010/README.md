	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article provides a description of the donation system in Microsoft
	Allegiance.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The donation system in Allegiance works in the following manner:
	
	- A player with a dot beside their name is not donating to another player and
	  is eligible to receive donations.
	
	- A player with either a gold circle or a dollar sign beside their name is the
	  current team leader.
	
	- A player with a grey dollar sign beside their name is currently donating
	  their income to another player.
	
	In Allegiance, the player who receives money from the greatest number of players
	is "elected" as the current team leader.
	
	To donate to a player other than the current team leader, a donor must stop
	donating to the current team leader, and then select a player who is eligible to
	receive donations (is not currently donating to another player). When this
	player receives donations from more players than the the current team leader,
	the player becomes the new team leader.
	
	In this manner, players can use the donation system to elect a new team leader.
