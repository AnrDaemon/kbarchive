	Article: Q262197

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a player attempts to self-destruct in Microsoft Allegiance, nothing
	happens.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The CTRL+SHIFT+D (3x) key combination is incorrectly labeled "Suicide" on the
	Basic Controls page of the Allegiance Survival Guide.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The CTRL+SHIFT+D (3x) key combination is mapped to the Eject From Turret
	action.
	
	The CTRL+SHIFT+D (3x) key combination is only effective when a player is a turret
	gunner and attempts to eject from the turret. A player may want to eject from a
	turret before the ship reaches a base or before the ship is destroyed.
