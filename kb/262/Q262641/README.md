	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the new Ghost Race feature of Microsoft Motocross Madness
	2. In a Ghost Race, a player races against their best time on any track in a
	Baha, Enduro, National, or Supercross race.
	
	How to Record a Ghost Race Lap

	  icon).
	
	2. Click the race event type that you want to run.
	
	3. In the Race Mode box, click Ghost Race.

	5. Click the checkered flag icon to start the race.
	
	6. When you are finished or satisfied with your latest Ghost Race lap, press the
	  ESC key.
	
	7. Click Quit Event. When you are prompted to save the current ghost lap, click
	  Yes. The ghost race lap is saved with a date and time stamp.
	
	NOTE: In a Supercross race, you must run an initial lap to warm up before the
	timer is started for the ghost race. As a result, you run two laps before your
	ghost rider appears.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The ghost rider competes against your current lap taking the exact same route
	and time from the ghost lap. When you defeat the ghost rider, the winning route
	and time automatically replace the route and time that you were racing against.
	
	NOTE: To share your ghost lap files with another player, copy the ghost lap
	(.gho) files from the Record folder in the Motocross Madness 2 installation
	folder, and then send the files to the other player.
	
	The other player can paste the ghost lap files into the Record folder in their
	Motocross Madness 2 installation folder, and then race against the ghost riders
	that you recorded.
