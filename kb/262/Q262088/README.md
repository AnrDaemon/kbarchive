	The information in this article applies to:

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can use the "Show Desktop feature" included with the versions of Windows
	listed above to minimize or restore all of your open programs, and easily view
	the desktop. To use this feature, click Show Desktop on the Quicklaunch toolbar
	on the right-side of the taskbar.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To view the Show Desktop button if you are running a full-screen program such as
	a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation in Slide Show mode, you can press the
	Windows key or press CTRL+ESC. When you click Show Desktop, your programs are
	all minimized or restored, depending on their current state.
	
	NOTE: In Windows 2000 Professional, the programs that are running may be returned
	in reverse order. This means that the program that was previously in the
	foreground, returns behind programs that were previously behind it.
	
	
	NOTE: If the Show Desktop icon is missing, and the Show Desktop.scf file is
	present in the Windows\System, or WINNT\System32 folder, you can add it to the
	Quick Launch Bar by performing the following steps:
	
	- Click Start/ Find /Files or Folders, or Start/ Search /For Files or Folders
	  and seacrh for *.scf.
	
	- Drag the Show Desktop file from the c:\windows\system folder to the quick
	  lanch bar to create a shortcut for it there.
	
	NOTE: If the Show Desktop icon is missing from the Quick Launch Bar, you can
	recreate it by following this article:
