	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for version 3.1 has been updated. The WRK Setup
	program has been revised, two of the readme (.WRI) files have been removed, and
	new online documentation has been included. The hard copy documentation did not
	change.
	
	New Setup Program
	-----------------
	
	The WRK Setup program has been revised. The earlier version of Setup placed all
	of the WRK files in one directory. The new Setup program places files into three
	separate subdirectories. For example, if you specify C:\WRK for your destination
	directory, the utilities are placed into C:\WRK\UTIL, the readme files (.WRI
	file) are placed in C:\WRK\README, and the new online documents (white papers)
	are placed into C:\WRK\WHITEPPR.
