	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using the Character Map application in the Microsoft Windows operating
	system version 3.1, bold and italic fonts are not available.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Character Map application allows you to select characters from a particular
	font and copy them into the Clipboard. This is especially useful when using
	characters whose ANSI values are greater than 127 and do not appear on the
	keyboard. The fonts that are available are the Windows screen fonts. These
	include TrueType fonts, raster screen fonts, and vector screen fonts. However,
	the italic and bold forms of these fonts are not available, only the regular
	form.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only workaround to the limitation of the Character Map is to paste the font
	into your document and use the features of that particular application to change
	the font style.
