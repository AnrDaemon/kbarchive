	If a Logitech or Microsoft PS/2 style mouse is plugged into a PS/2 port on
	an American Mitac computer, the mouse may not work in Windows 386 enhanced
	mode. If the mouse does function in Windows, the system may appear to hang
	when exiting Windows until one of the mouse buttons is pressed.
	
	According to American Mitac, a BIOS upgrade should solve this problem.
	
	This information applies to the Mitac 3026e. For more information,
	please contact Mitac at (408) 435-1958.
