	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run a screen saver with Windows version 3.1, you may inadvertently
	start an application when deactivating the screen saver by pressing the ENTER
	key.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent an application from starting, lengthen the Delay Before First Repeat
	setting in the Keyboard section of the Control Panel, or use another key or the
	mouse to cancel the screen saver.
	
	This problem may be user and keyboard dependent, because it is based on the way
	the ENTER key is pressed to cancel the screen saver.
	
	1. Run Control Panel.
	
	2. Choose the Keyboard icon.
	
	3. Set Delay Before First Repeat to a higher.
	
	4. Choose OK.
