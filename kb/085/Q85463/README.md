	(GP) fault when playing the sound.
	
	WORKAROUND

	Instead of using Packager to insert the .WAV file into a document, insert the
	sound directly.
	
	1. Run Word for Windows.
	
	2. From the Insert menu, choose Object.
	
	3. Choose Sound and choose the OK button.
	
	4. Sound Recorder will start.
	
	5. From the Edit menu, choose Insert File.
	
	6. Load one of the sample .WAV files in the Windows directory.
	
	7. From the File menu, choose Exit.
	
	8. When prompted to Exit and Update, choose Yes.
