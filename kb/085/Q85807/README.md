	In Windows version 3.1, the Object Packager may cause a "Divide by
	Zero or Overflow Error" when you attempt to drag one of the first six
	icons out of the display window by dragging the icon to the left.
	
	This occurs when the mouse pointer nears the horizontal plane on which
	the icons are shown. This error will occur in standard or enhanced mode.
	
	This error will also occur with icons from other *.DLL, *.EXE, or *.ICO
	files.
