	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you boot a machine from the floppy drive before running the Setup program for
	version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
	on the boot disk does not get modified.
	
	For instance, the Setup program prompts you to add the line SHARE.EXE to the
	AUTOEXEC.BAT file if you want SHARE loaded automatically. However, when you add
	the line, it is not written to the AUTOEXEC.BAT on the boot disk or the hard
	drive.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
