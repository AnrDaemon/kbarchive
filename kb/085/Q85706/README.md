	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Calendar program included with Microsoft Windows does not display more than
	14 lines in the daily schedule.
	
	With the default interval of 60 minutes set, this equates to 14 hours of the day.
	If a shorter interval is selected, still only the first 14 intervals are
	displayed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Maximizing Calendar will not increase the number of lines available in the
	window. If the window is resized to a smaller dimension, the number of lines
	displayed will be reduced. Use the scroll bars to view additional intervals in
	the schedule.
