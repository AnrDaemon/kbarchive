	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Microsoft Windows Setup in custom mode on a machine that does not
	have an existing copy of Windows 3.1, you may be given the option to run the
	tutorial when it is not available.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If you choose not to install the Windows accessories, the tutorial files
	(WINTUTOR.*) will not be installed. If you then select the option to run the
	tutorial, Setup will continue as if you had elected to skip the tutorial.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
