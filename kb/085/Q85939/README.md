	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	When using Hewlett-Packard (HP) soft fonts with an HP LaserJet Series II printer,
	you are limited to having only 32 downloadable soft fonts installed (permanent
	or temporary) in Microsoft Windows version 3.1. If you attempt to have more than
	32 soft fonts, then you may receive a general protection (GP) fault in
	UNIDRV.DLL.
	
	The HP LaserJet is also limited to 16 soft fonts per page. These limitations are
	the result of the printer's design.
	
	The HP LaserJet Series II uses the HPPCL.DRV driver version 1.1.
