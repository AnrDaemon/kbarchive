	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If the Windows Resource Kit version 3.1's TopDesk application is abnormally
	terminated, one or more applications might be lost outside the visual part of
	the desktop.
	
	You can use keyboard commands to position any application, which might have been
	lost outside the screen boundaries, back into the visible section of the screen.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In some cases, such as a general protection (GP) fault or any other abnormal
	situation that would terminate the TopDesk program, visual contact with active
	applications might be lost.
	
	Steps to Return Lost Applications to the Visible Screen
	-------------------------------------------------------
	
	1. Press the CTRL+ESC key combination to run the Windows Task List. The Task
	  List dialog box appears with a list of all running applications.
	
	2. Select the application to recover by using the mouse or arrow keys.
	
	3. Choose Switch To. The desired application will be active.
	
	  Selecting Tile from the Task List displays all running applications.
	
	  The TopDesk application is designed to work along with the Windows Task List.
	  However, if TopDesk is not active, the following additional steps should be
	  completed:
	
	  a. Press ALT+SPACEBAR to open the Control Box menu for the invisible
	     application. The application will not be seen at this point, but the menu
	     options will be visible.
	
	  b. Select Move.
	
	  c. Use the keyboard to bring the application back into the main screen.
	     Notice that the position of the menu itself indicates the approximate
	     location of the invisible application. For example, if the Control Box
	     menu appears in the upper-left corner, use the DOWN ARROW and RIGHT ARROW
	     keys to bring the application down and to the right.
