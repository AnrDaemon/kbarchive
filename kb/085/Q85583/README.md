	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The programs included with Microsoft Windows do not support a typeover feature.
	These programs are always in insert mode, regardless of the state of the INSERT
	key. Text to the right of the cursor is shifted to the right when typing in
	these programs.
	
	These programs include Notepad, Write, Cardfile, and Calendar.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Many applications, and usually word processors, support a toggle between
	typeover (overwrite) and insert modes.
	
	As a workaround to not having an insert mode, first highlight the area to type
	over, then begin typing. This will delete the highlighted area before inserting
	text.
