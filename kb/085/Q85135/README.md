	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some Gateway 2000 computers may require a BIOS upgrade to prevent MS-DOS Prompt
	from beeping repeatedly in 386 enhanced mode of Microsoft Windows 3.1. Machines
	that have a Quadtel BIOS version 3.05.05 may run an MS-DOS- based application or
	MS-DOS Prompt, and then beep twice before hanging.
	
	NOTE: You may experience this problem only after pressing ALT+ENTER to access an
	MS-DOS window.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, update your BIOS to Quadtel 3.05.07.
