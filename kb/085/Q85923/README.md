	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Lotus technical support has confirmed that printing from Lotus Freelance
	Graphics for Windows to some Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers at 150 dots per inch
	(dpi) can result in corrupted output.
	
	Setting the dpi to 300 or 75 may correct this problem.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	According to Lotus, this problem has been most evident when printing to HP
	LaserJet printers. However, Lotus has no information on this problem with other
	HP printers.
	
	As a workaround, Lotus suggests setting the resolution to 300 or 75 dpi. Lotus
	has developed a patch disk for Freelance Graphics for Windows that should
	correct this problem.
	
	The Lotus product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
