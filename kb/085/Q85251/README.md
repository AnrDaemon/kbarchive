	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you cannot print TrueType fonts to your QMS-PS 410 or 815 PostScript printer
	under Microsoft Windows 3.1, you may need to upgrade your printer's BIOS. For
	the QMS-PS 815, the BIOS that supports TrueType fonts is version 2.9 or later.
	For the QMS-PS 410, the BIOS that supports TrueType fonts is version 9.4a or
	later.
	
	Windows 3.1 does not support the use of the QMS-PS 815; however, the QMS-PS 815
	can be set up as a QMS-PS 810.
