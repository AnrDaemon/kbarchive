	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Microsoft Windows Setup and press the ESC key when prompted for the
	next disk, Setup skips the file (that is, it will not copy it to your machine).
	Each time you press ESC, one file is skipped. This only occurs in the graphical
	portion of Windows 3.1 Setup.
	
	Note: When the file is skipped the machine will beep, but no warning message nor
	any other indication that a file has been skipped is displayed.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
