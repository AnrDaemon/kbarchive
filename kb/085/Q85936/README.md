	under Windows version 3.1, the following error message is displayed:
	
	  Repairing path, please wait
	
	At this point, the system usually stops (hangs). It has also been reported that
	the system may drop out of Windows and back to the MS-DOS command prompt.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Versions 5.O1 and earlier of Real World Accounting Software are not designed to
	run under Windows.
	
	LOADWIN.COM, a software patch written by SKI, allows Real World Accounting
	Software to run under Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a. However, this patch DOES
	NOT WORK with Windows version 3.1.
	
	Real World Accounting Software version 6.0 is compatible with Windows 3.1. It
	will run unassisted (that is, without the need for a .PIF) under Windows 3.1.
	
	NOTE: If you are running Real World over a Novell network you must run in
	enhanced mode, not standard mode, since Novell's working directory doesn't work
	in Windows standard mode.
