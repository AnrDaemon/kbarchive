## Q85756: ALR Computers Do Not Show Valid BIOS Dates

	Article: Q85756
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 01-NOV-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	According to Advance Logic Research (ALR) technical support, the BIOS dates used
	in ALR computers do not reflect the current BIOS version being used. For
	example, a BIOS may have the date 1988, but the BIOS version is version 1.13
	which is a 1992 BIOS.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When ALR changes a ROM BIOS, the date of the original BIOS remains intact; only
	the version number changes. When using Microsoft Diagnostic utility (MSD) or
	DEBUG.COM to find the date of the BIOS, you may not be finding valid
	information.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To find out current BIOS versions for ALR computers, contact ALR technical
	support.
