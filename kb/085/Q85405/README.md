	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a document is printed to an Epson T-750 with US Standard Fanfold 14
	7/8-by-11-inch paper from Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the right margin cannot
	be set to a value less than 6.62 inches.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, install the Epson FX-286e printer driver to use US
	Standard Fanfold paper, and use this driver. You may also need to adjust the
	printer's DIP switches. Turn Switch 3 on Bank 1 into the ON position if you are
	having problems with the graphic character set.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the T-750 printer driver version
	1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
