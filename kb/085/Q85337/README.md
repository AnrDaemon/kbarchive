	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax program requires this hardware:
	
	- Its own workstation on the network
	
	- A network connection to the MS Mail database
	
	- A fax board installed
	
	For more information on compatible fax boards, query on these words in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  "fax" (without the quotation marks) and "boards" (without the quotation
	  marks) and "Fax Gateway" (without the quotation marks)
	
	If you are using one of the Intel fax boards, the gateway needs a dedicated IBM
	PC/XT/AT or 100-percent compatible with at least 512K of memory. If you are
	using the GammaLink GammaFax board, the gateway needs an IBM PC or compatible
	386 with a minimum 2 MB of memory.
	
	The gateway also needs an outside telephone line.
