	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	An MS-DOS-based application that has been added to the LOAD= line of the WIN.INI
	file may not have the same icon as the same MS-DOS application started from
	Windows version 3.1 desktop.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Windows 3.1, when an MS-DOS-based application is minimized it retains the
	same icon as portrayed on the desktop.
	
	If the same MS-DOS-based application is started from the LOAD= line and from the
	desktop, and if both are minimized, the one started from the LOAD= line may have
	a different icon than the one started from the desktop.
