	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	GRID Systems has confirmed that the Windows 3.1 VGA video driver may not work on
	some GRID 1550sx laptop computers when running in 386 enhanced mode. The
	computer may hang when exiting an MS-DOS-based application running in a full
	screen in Windows 3.1.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use the VGA (version 3.0) driver included with
	Windows 3.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The cause of the problem is related to a proprietary BIOS chip GRID places in
	the 1550SX that works in tandem with a CIRRUS BIOS. There are at least two
	different releases of the GRID BIOS.
	
	For additional information, contact GRID Systems technical support.
