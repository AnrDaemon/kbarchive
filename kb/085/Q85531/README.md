	ANSI characters are not display in Windows 3.0 Write when input from a macro
	created and run by Recorder. Examples of the ANSI character set are currency
	symbols, mathematical symbols, and fractions. These are characters not typically
	found on a normal keyboard, and are entered by pressing the ALT key plus a
	combination of numbers.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows operating
	system version 3.0. This problem was corrected Windows version 3.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When using Recorder with Write to create a macro to input ANSI characters into a
	document, the characters are displayed in Write during the recording process.
	When the macro is played back, the ANSI characters are not displayed in the
	Write document. Using Recorder with Notepad works correctly.
