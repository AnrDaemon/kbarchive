	Introduction
	------------
	
	When you install the Pure Black and White Printing Add-in files
	included with this Application Note, you can quickly print your
	PowerPoint for Windows 95 presentations in pure black and white.
	Printing in pure black and white eliminates object fills as well as
	background colors and shading, while making your slide text and object
	borders and lines black. As a result, your presentations will print
	more quickly and have sharper, cleaner lines.
	
	NOTE: Imported graphics and OLE objects will not print in pure black
	and white, nor will objects that were previously customized for
	black and white printing using the PowerPoint Black And White drop-
	down menu. For more information, see the "Troubleshooting Pure Black
	and White Printing Problems" section later in this Application Note.
	
	Installation
	------------
	
	To add the Pure Black and White Printing Add-in to PowerPoint for
	Windows 95, do the following:
	
	1. If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk
	  in drive A.
	
	  If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
	  skip to step 2. This procedure assumes that you have already
	  downloaded and extracted the compressed file.
	
	2. If you are running Windows 95, click the Start button, and then
	  click Run. (If you are running Windows NT(TM), choose Run from the
	  File menu in Program Manager or File Manager.)
	
	3. In the Open text box (or the Command Line box in Windows NT), type
	  the following, and then click OK
	
	     <source>:\setup
	
	  where <source> is the location of the Pure Black and White
	  Printing Add-in files. For example, if you are installing from the
	  Application Note disk in drive A, type the following:
	
	     a:\setup
	
	  Or, if you downloaded and expanded Wt1249.exe from an online
	  service to C:\Download, type the following:
	
	     c:\download\setup
	
	4. When Setup starts, it will ask if you want to install the
	  PowerPoint Print Pure Black and White feature.  Answer yes by
	  typing "y" (without the quotation marks) and pressing ENTER.
	
	The Pure Black and White Printing Add-in is now installed. When you
	run PowerPoint, the Print Pure Black And White command should be
	located on the File menu. If you were running PowerPoint when you
	installed the add-in, you will need to quit and restart PowerPoint for
	the installation to take effect.
	
	Printing in Pure Black and White
	--------------------------------
	
	To print your presentation quickly in pure black and white, do the
	following:
	
	1. On the File menu, click Print Pure Black And White. (If this
	  command is unavailable, see the preceding "Installation" section.)
	
	2. In the Print dialog box, select the print options you want.
	
	3. Make sure the Black & White check box is selected. (By default,
	  this option is selected if you are printing to a black and white
	  printer. If you are printing to a color printer, the option will
	  not be selected, and you will have to click it to select it.)
	
	4. Click OK to print the presentation.
	
	  NOTE: There may be a delay when printing, especially with large
	  presentations.  Additionally, grouped PowerPoint objects may not
	  print in pure black and white. To ensure pure black and white
	  printing, ungroup grouped PowerPoint objects before printing.
	
	Troubleshooting Pure Black and White Printing Problems
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	There are three types of objects in PowerPoint presentations that
	won't print in pure black and white:
	
	  - Imported graphics, such as bitmaps
	  - OLE objects
	  - Objects that have been previously customized for normal black
	    and white printing
	
	There is no way to print imported graphics and OLE objects in pure
	black and white. However, when normal PowerPoint objects do not print
	in pure black and white as expected, the objects may have been
	previously customized for normal black and white printing, and you can
	restore their attributes so that they print correctly.
	
	In PowerPoint for Windows 95, you can improve the way an object will
	look when printed in black and white (without using the Pure Black and
	White Printing Add-in). To customize the black and white view and
	printing results for an object, you would do the following:
	
	1. On the View Menu, click Black And White.
	
	2. Select the object you want to customize, and then click the right
	  mouse button.
	
	3. Point to Black And White. A menu appears from which you can select
	  the preferred black and white display and print attributes for the
	  selected object.
	
	If you previously modified an object by changing its black and white
	attributes, PowerPoint cannot print it in pure black and white. To
	print a previously customized object, use the preceding steps and
	select Automatic in the Black And White drop-down menu in step 3. This
	clears the custom setting so that the object can be printed in pure
	black and white.
