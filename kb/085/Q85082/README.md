	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you run a slide show using the PowerPoint Viewer included with Microsoft
	PowerPoint for Windows, you may find that you have less memory available than
	you did before the slide show.
	
	
	NOTE: This problem does not occur with the Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Check your available memory. From the Help menu in Program Manager, choose
	  About Program Manager. Note the amount of free memory listed.
	
	2. Run a slide show using the PowerPoint Viewer.
	
	3. Check your available memory again. It should have decreased by between 4K and
	  32K.
	
	4. Run the same slide show again using the PowerPoint Viewer.
	
	5. Check your available memory again. It should have decreased again (by the
	  same increment in step 3).
