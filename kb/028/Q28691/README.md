	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	For Versions 2.13 and 2.14 of Flight Simulator, the command-line switches are as
	follows:
	
	  Command    Graphics Card
	  -------    -------------
	
	  FS         Standard IBM CGA
	  FS H       Hercules Monochrome Graphics Card
	  FS E       Standard IBM EGA
	  FS M       Standard IBM EGA in Monochrome Mode
	
	Versions 3.00 and Version 4.00 of Flight Simulator do not have any command-line
	switches. Instead, start Flight Simulator by pressing "FS". A menu appears
	prompting you for the kind of graphics card you have.
