## Q28515: Cipher Data Tape Drive Conflicts with Bus Mouse

	Article: Q28515
	Product(s): See article

	The Cipher Data Tape Drive can be set to use I/O address 220-23F;
	however, this setting causes the drive to forward and reverse every
	time the Bus mouse moves.
	   The Tape Drive can reportedly use another I/O address to resolve
	the conflict. This is not a problem with the serial mouse.
