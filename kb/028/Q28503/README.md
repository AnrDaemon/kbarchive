## Q28503: Compaq Portable 3 Compatibility

	Article: Q28503
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 1.00
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 6-SEP-1988
	
	The Compaq Portable 3 has built-in hardware that includes a serial
	port and an expansion chassis slot. The serial mouse should work
	properly in the standard serial port. The bus mouse will not fit in
	the only slot available for the expansion chassis, but should fit in
	the expansion chassis slot (this has not been tested).
