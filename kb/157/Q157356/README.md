	must switch to normal view, page layout view, or print preview.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 for Windows provides a new document viewing option called
	online layout view. This view optimizes the layout to make online reading
	easier. Text appears larger and wraps to fit the window, rather than the way it
	actually prints.
	
	To switch to online layout view, on the View menu, click Online Layout.
