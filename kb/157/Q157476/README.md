	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you convert a Word 97 document that contains equation objects to
	WordPerfect 5.x for Windows format, and then reopen the document in Word 97, the
	equation objects appear to be missing. If field codes view is turned on, you
	will see the {Embed.Equation.3} fields; however, if field codes view is turned
	off, you do not see the equation objects.
	
	The document appears correctly when opened in WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x. However,
	when you edit and save the document in WordPerfect and then reopen the document
	in Word 97, the objects appear to be missing.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The objects are still present in the document, but it may be difficult to locate
	them. Turn on field codes view to determine where they are located, turn off
	field codes view, and then double-click the equation object to update it.
