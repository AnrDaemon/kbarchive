	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you have linked text boxes in Odd/Even Headers and Footers, the Next Text
	Box button may produce inconsistent results. The Previous Text Box button works
	correctly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
	beginning of this article.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 for Windows allows you to link text boxes. With this feature,
	text can start in one text box and flow into the next linked text box. A good
	example of this feature is a newsletter. The text of an article can start on
	page one and flow to the next text box on page three (or any other page) to
	complete the article.
	
	Text boxes have full functionality when you use them in the body of the document.
	If you place them in Odd/Even Headers, the functionality of advancing to the
	next text box is not the same as when they are in the body of the document. The
	previous text box functionality is the same as it is in the body of the
	document.
