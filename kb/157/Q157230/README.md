	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are upgrading a computer to Windows NT 4.0, you may receive the
	following error message:
	
	  The procedure entry point NTDiskeeper could not be located in the dynamic
	  link library Ntdll.dll.
	
	This error can be generated by either the Dkfat.exe or Dkntfs.exe module, and can
	occur even if the services are stopped before you begin the upgrade process.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you are upgrading a computer on which DisKeeper 1.1
	by Executive Software is installed. DisKeeper 1.1 replaces the Windows NT kernel
	with a modified version.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, uninstall DisKeeper 1.1 before you upgrade the
	computer to Windows NT 4.0.
