	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Remote Mail feature of Microsoft Exchange to download headers
	from MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may be disconnected from MSN even though
	you have not enabled the "Disconnect after updating headers from remote mail"
	option.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, start MSN and then use Remote Mail to down- load
	headers. Note that you need to either open Microsoft Exchange and then start MSN
	or disable the "Download mail when e-mail starts up from MSN" option to avoid
	having mail automatically downloaded.
