	The following is the procedure to allow remote users to install the Microsoft
	Exchange MS-DOS client:
	
	1. The Microsoft Exchange Administrator copies all of the MS-DOS client install
	  files to multiple floppy disks and gives them to the user.
	
	2. The user copies all these files to their hard disk drive.
	
	3. The user then runs the Setup.exe program from their hard disk drive.
	
	The MS-DOS client install does not use CAB files like the Windows client install.
