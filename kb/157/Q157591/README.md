	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses improving Golf performance on machines with 8 MB of RAM.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If performance is slow on your computer with 8 MB of RAM, the following tips may
	help:
	
	- Close some of the Golf windows (for example, if both Main View and Green View
	  are displayed, then close Green View).
	- Reduce the size of Main View.
	- Modify options in the Display Options dialog box such as:
	
	  1. Click No for Draw Shadows.
	
	  2. Click No for Texture Terrain.
	
	  3. Set the Terrain Details to all minimums.
	
	  When you turn off Texture Terrain and reduce the Terrain Detail levels, you
	  affect the appearance of the course. Do this only if speed is more important
	  than appearance.
	
	NOTE: On some machines, having all the graphic and sound features turned on may
	cause a significant delay in task-switching from one application to another.
	This delay may adversely affect time- critical applications such as
	communications and e-mail packages. It is highly recommended to close
	time-critical applications before playing Golf. To improve task-switching from
	Golf, you can turn off the Background, Ambient, and Commentary Sounds, as well
	as lower the Terrain/Texture Display settings.
