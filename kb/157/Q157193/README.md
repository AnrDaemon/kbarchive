	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The "ActiveX Controls Overview" topic in the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Help and Online
	Documentation incorrectly lists Comctl32.ocx as one of the .ocx files shipped
	with Visual FoxPro. The file name should be Comctl32.ocx.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Issue the following command from the Visual FoxPro Command window to locate the
	topic in Help:
	
	     HELP ActiveX Controls Overview
	
	For Online and hard-copy Documentation, go to the "ActiveX Controls Overview"
	section under the "Programming" chapter of the Technical Reference.
	
	In the topic, look at the very first file in the table that lists the .ocx files
	that ship with Visual FoxPro. This file should be Comctl32.ocx.
