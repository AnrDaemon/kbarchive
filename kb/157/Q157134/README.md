## Q157134: WD97: 3-D Page Border is not Applied

	Article: Q157134
	Product(s): Word 97 for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:97
	Operating System(s):

	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select the 3-D preset border style, Word displays all line styles
	including those that do not apply a 3-D border. For example, if you select one
	of the first twenty line styles in the Style list box, Word applies a
	one-dimensional border to your page even though you clicked the 3-D preset. (To
	locate this option, click Borders and Shading on the Format menu and click the
	Page Border tab.)
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Word does not display a list of line styles based on the type of preset you
	select. The 3-D preset works only with special line styles. Currently, you can
	apply a 3-D border using either of the last two line styles in the Borders and
	Shading Dialog box.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To apply a 3-D page border, select one of the last two styles in the Style list
	box in the Borders and Shading Dialog box.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
