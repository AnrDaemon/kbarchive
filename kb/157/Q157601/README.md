	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses Golf version 3.0 game play issues. Use the following tips
	to ensure proper game performance:
	
	- It's recommended that you do not change screen resolutions during gameplay.
	
	- If for some reason you're having trouble moving the swing control or if it
	  disappears, click the Views menu, then click Layout. Select a layout and
	  click the Use button. If this doesn't work, save your game and restart Golf.
	  Then select a new layout again.
	
	- Some of the advanced features of the Microsoft Intellipoint 2.0 Mouse
	  software may interfere with the swing control in Golf 3.0. The ClickSaver,
	  Snap To, Focus, Smart Speed, and the Clicklock features should be turned off
	  before playing Golf 3.0.
	
	- When you pause a recorded player using the onscreen Waiting for Shot alert
	  dialog box, the dialog box subsequently disappears. To activate the player,
	  simply click the Swing Control.
	
	- Running both Golf 2.0 and Golf 3.0 simultaneously from the same machine will
	  cause both versions to run incorrectly.
	
	- Recorded players from previous versions of Golf will be converted when added
	  to Golf 3.0; however, this conversion will sometimes cause some player
	  attributes (such as gender) to change.
	
	- If Harbour Town or Banff Springs disappear from your course selection list,
	  run Setup again and select the reinstall option.
	
	- If ambient background sounds stop during your game, choosing Help or running
	  a flyby usually resets the sound. If not, you can save the game, restart
	  Golf, and resume the game.
	
	- Setting the aggressiveness of computer players to extreme values (1 or 10)
	  may cause strange behavior by the computer player. You should avoid these
	  settings if possible.
