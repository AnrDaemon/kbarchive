	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses troubleshooting video problems you may encounter when
	running Golf 3.0.
	
	DISPLAYING 256 COLORS
	---------------------
	
	Your computer must display 256 colors to run Golf 3.0.
	
	If you don't have the necessary 256-color driver, or if you aren't sure that your
	video card supports 256 colors, contact your video card manufacturer.
	
	To display 256 colors in Windows 95/98:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the Display icon.
	
	3. Click the Settings tab.
	
	4. In the Color Palette or Color drop-down list, click 256 Color.
	
	5. Click OK.
	
	RESOLVING OTHER VIDEO DRIVER CONFLICTS
	--------------------------------------
	
	If you install different video drivers after installing Golf 3.0, it may change
	the performance of the game.
	
	If you experience distorted colors, ghosting or other irregular video problems
	you should consult the Display.txt or Readme.txt file packaged with Windows
	95/98 or Windows NT 3.51/4.0 for hardware specific display problems. Most video
	issues can be resolved by updating the operating system's display drivers.
	Consult your OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for a possible display driver
	upgrade.
	
	Some systems may have display problems when using incorrect or generic Windows
	video drivers. Be sure you have installed the correct video driver for your
	video card.
	
	Contact your video-card manufacturer for verification of the latest video driver,
	and for information about obtaining the latest driver.
