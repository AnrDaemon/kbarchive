	- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores Inside the Earth for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The main focus of the Magic School Bus Explores the Earth is to help Arnold find
	missing rocks in his collection. As rocks are picked up in the different areas,
	they are automatically placed in front of the Rock Box on the Geotable. They
	appear in the box with a question mark for a label if they are not tested before
	leaving the table. They can be studied later to find out what type of rock they
	are.
	
	NOTE: Rocks in the box with labels can be removed and looked at under the
	magnifying glass, but not retested.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To get to the Geotable from inside the front of the bus:
	
	1. Click the mirror with Ms. Frizzle in the upper-left area.
	
	2. Once you are in the rear of the bus, click the table on the lower-left corner
	  with the pick-hammer on top.
	
	The Geotable
	------------
	
	There are five main areas of the Geotable: the Rock Box, the Sponge, the
	Magnifying Glass, the testing tools, and the Streak Test.
	
	The Rock Box
	------------
	
	The rocks picked up are found on the table outside the rock box or by clicking
	the arrows on the lid of the box until the label has a question mark.
	
	Select the unknown rock to be tested by clicking it, and it moving to the center
	of the table.
	
	The Sponge
	----------
	
	Use the sponge to clean the rock and determine whether it is a rock or mineral
	when viewed under the magnifying glass.
	
	To use the Sponge:
	
	1. Click the sponge.
	
	2. Move the sponge to the rock, and click as you move the sponge over the rock
	  to wash it.
	
	The Magnifying Glass
	--------------------
	
	Click the magnifying glass to activate it. It will swing into motion, telling you
	whether you have a rock or mineral. It automatically swings back during testing,
	but it can be used to look at all the stones in the box close up.
	
	Use the Scratch Tools to determine the hardness of the rock. The Scratch tools,
	from hardest to softest, are the pin, the quarter, and the pocket knife.
	
	NOTE: The hammer and the vinegar are for amusement only.
	
	To determine the hardness:
	
	1. Click the pin to pick it up.
	
	2. Position it over the stone and click to test.
	
	3. Move the pin back to its original position.
	
	4. Click to replace the dropper in the jar.
	
	5. Repeat steps 1-5 with the quarter and the pocket knife.
	
	Use the Streak test to see what residue, if any, is left by the rock.
	
	To use the Streak test:
	
	1. Click the rock to pick it up.
	
	2. Move it to the smudge test paper.
	
	3. Click to test the stone on the paper.
	
	4. If the stone leaves a mark, find the mark at the bottom of the table with the
	  same color. Put an x in the square to the left of the squiggle with the same
	  streak color.
	
	After all tests are completed, Arnold will tell you what rock or mineral you have
	found.
