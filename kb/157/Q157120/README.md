	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you first select and then right-click on a text box you get one of two
	shortcut menus. This problem does not occur if the text box is not selected
	before you right-click. For example, if you right-click on the edge of the text
	box, the shortcut menu displays the following commands:
	
	  Cut
	  Copy
	  Paste
	  Edit Text
	  Grouping
	  Order
	  Create Text Box link
	  Set AutoShape Defaults
	  Format Text Box
	
	If you right-click in the center of the text box, the shortcut menu displays
	these commands:
	
	  Cut
	  Copy
	  Paste
	  Borders and shading
	  Format Frame
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To select the shortcut menu to format the text box, select the text box and then
	right-click the border of the text box.
	
	To select the shortcut menu for the text that you typed inside the text box,
	click once inside the text box and then right-click the text you want to format
	in the text box. The shortcut menu displays the following commands. (Note that
	some of the commands listed below may be unavailable if text is not selected
	inside the text box.)
	
	  Cut
	  Copy
	  Paste
	  Font
	  Paragraph
	  Bullets and Numbering
