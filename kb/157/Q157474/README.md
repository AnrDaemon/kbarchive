	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you click Links on the Edit menu and then click Change Source in the Links
	dialog box, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  The linked file was unavailable and could not be updated.
	
	This error occurs if the file your presentation is linked to is in a folder with
	an exclamation point (!) in its name.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is caused by a problem in Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.51. Other programs
	may also have problems linking to files in folders with this kind of name. This
	problem does not occur in Windows NT 4.0.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Do not link to files that are stored in a folder with an exclamation point in
	its name.
