## Q157019: XADM: Changing X400 Country Code Toggles Between SE and SG

	Article: Q157019
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to edit the properties
	of a Microsoft Exchange mailbox, the country code within the X.400 address might
	change. If the country code is set to SE (Sweden) you might see it change to SG
	(Singapore), and vice versa. The problem can also be seen when you edit Custom
	Recipient, Site Address, or Address Space details. Again, only country codes set
	to SE and SG will be affected.
	
	
	STATUS
	======

	version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
