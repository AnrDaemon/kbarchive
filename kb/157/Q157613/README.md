	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you save a Word 97 document that contains bullet characters to Word for the
	Macintosh 5.x format, and then reopen the document in Word 97, the bullets
	display as boxes. The document opens correctly in Word for the Macintosh 5.x.
	However, if you edit and save the document in Word for the Macintosh 5.x format
	and then reopen it in Word 97, the bullets display as boxes. This problem occurs
	in Word 97 when you apply bullets using the Bullet button on the Formatting
	toolbar, or when you choose the Symbol command on the Insert menu and select the
	Symbol font.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, choose the appropriate method:
	
	Method 1. In Word 97, create the bullets using the Symbol command on the Insert
	menu and the normal text font.
	
	Method 2. After you open the document in Word for the Macintosh and make changes,
	save the document in Interchange Format (RTF).
