	The following graphic filters are installed during a typical Setup of either Word
	97 or Office 97. These filters convert graphics on import with the exception of
	the WordPerfect Graphics/DrawPerfect and CompuServe GIF converters. These two
	converters are used by the WordPerfect and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
	text converters, respectively.
	
	
	- Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)
	
	- Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
	
	- WordPerfect Graphics/DrawPerfect (Imports WPG 1.0, 1.0e, and 2.0)
	
	- WordPerfect Graphics (Export only)
	
	- Macintosh PICT
	
	- CompuServe GIF (import/export) used by the HTML converter.

	The following graphics filters are not installed during a typical Setup. To
	install these filters, rerun the Setup program, click Add/Remove, and then

	supported by Word for Windows only.
