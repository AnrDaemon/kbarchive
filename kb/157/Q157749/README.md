	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 has 20 callouts that you can use in a Word document. Callouts
	are used to focus the reader's attention to a particular part of the document.
	There are two types of callouts in Word: line and bubble.
	
	A line callout is a line box that has a leader directing the reader's attention
	to a specific area of the document. There are 15 line callouts available, as
	follows:
	
	  Line Callout 1
	  Line Callout 2
	  Line Callout 3
	  Line Callout 4
	  Line Callout 1 (Accent Bar)
	  Line Callout 2 (Accent Bar)
	  Line Callout 3 (Accent Bar)
	  Line Callout 4 (Accent Bar)
	  Line Callout 1 (No Border)
	  Line Callout 2 (No Border)
	  Line Callout 3 (No Border)
	  Line Callout 4 (No Border)
	  Line Callout 1 (Border and Accent Bar)
	  Line Callout 2 (Border and Accent Bar)
	  Line Callout 3 (Border and Accent Bar)
	  Line Callout 4 (Border and Accent Bar)
	
	A bubble callout is a shape that does not have a leader. The shape has a pointer
	as part of the shape, but it is not considered a leader. There are four bubble
	callouts available, as follows:
	
	  Rectangular Callout
	  Rounded Rectangular Callout
	  Oval Callout
	  Cloud Callout
	
	Inserting Callouts
	------------------
	
	To insert a callout, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click Drawing.
	
	2. On the Drawing toolbar, click AutoShapes, point to Callouts, and then click
	  the callout you want.
	
	3. Draw the callout at the location you want in the document.
	
	Formatting Callouts
	-------------------
	
	To format the attributes of a callout, follow these steps:
	
	1. Right-click on one of the sides of the callout (a four-ended arrow should be
	  present on the mouse pointer). This brings up a shortcut menu.
	
	2. On the shortcut menu, click Format AutoShape.
	
	3. In the Format AutoShape dialog box, select the "Colors and Lines," "Size,"
	  "Position," or "Wrapping" tab, and select the settings you want for the
	  callout.
	
	4. In the Format AutoShape dialog box, click the Text Box tab. If the callout
	  you selected is a line callout, the Format Callout button is available.
	  However, if the callout you selected is a bubble callout, the Format Callout
	  button is unavailable.
	
	5. If the Format AutoShape button is available, click the button. In the Format
	  Callout dialog box, set the Type and Options that you want for the Leader and
	  Callout, and then click OK.
