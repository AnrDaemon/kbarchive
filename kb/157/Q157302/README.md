	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you import Personal Address Book (PAB) entries more than once using a
	Microsoft Exchange client, duplicate entries will be created.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Administrators who want to distribute a PAB to their users for occasional
	imports will typically maintain a single PAB, making modifications to it and
	sending it to their users. When those users import the PAB, duplicate entries
	will be created for every entry that already exists.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
	Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
