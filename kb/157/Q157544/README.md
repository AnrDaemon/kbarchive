	Increase the size of your existing text boxes to hold more text without the need
	for additional linked text boxes.
	
	1. Click the text box whose size you want to change.
	
	2. Drag a sizing handle until the text box is the size you want.
	
	Method 2: Change the Text Point Size
	------------------------------------
	
	Decrease the point size of the text in the linked text boxes.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can link two or more text boxes so that text flows between them as you type.
	You can also create text box links among shapes, such as circles, banners, and
	flow chart shapes. A text box or shape can have only one forward, or next, link
	and one backward, or previous, link. The maximum number of links you can have in
	one sequence is 31, linking together 32 text boxes or shapes.

	Search. Click the topic "Flow text to another part of my document with linked
	text boxes".
