	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you reopen a saved master document, the following buttons on the Master
	Document toolbar are dimmed or unavailable:
	
	- Create Subdocument
	
	- Remove Subdocument
	
	- Insert Subdocument
	
	- Merge Subdocument
	
	- Split Subdocument
	
	- Lock Subdocument (If insertion point is within a subdocument)
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design in Microsoft Word.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, use the following appropriate methods for your
	situation.
	
	Method 1: Expand the Subdocuments
	---------------------------------
	
	You are viewing the master document in collapsed view. Expand the subdocuments in
	the active master document by clicking the Expand Subdocuments button on the
	Master Document toolbar.
	
	Method 2: Unlock the Subdocuments
	---------------------------------
	
	The subdocuments are expanded but locked. Unlock the subdocuments by clicking
	within the subdocument and press the Lock Document button on the Master Document
	toolbar.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you reopen an existing master document, you are in collapsed view. In
	collapsed view, instead of seeing the contents of the subdocuments, you will see
	the file name and path of each subdocument. To work with subdocuments you must
	first expand them.
	
	If the subdocuments are also locked, you must unlock them before you can make
	changes. You cannot edit a locked subdocument in the master document, and when
	you open a locked subdocument in its own window, it opens as read- only. A
	locked subdocument is indicated by a small lock figure under the subdocument
	icon to the left of the subdocument.
