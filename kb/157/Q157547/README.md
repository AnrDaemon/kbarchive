	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create a Web page using the Web Page Wizard, extra copies of the
	graphics are saved in the same folder where you save your Web page.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The images, bullets, and horizontal rules in the original page are embedded;
	Word copies these to the folder where you save your web page establishing a
	relative link to the graphic images.
	
	If your Web page will be moved to a server, you can copy the entire folder and
	its contents to the new location. This helps ensure that your images display and
	hyperlinks work when others view your Web page.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	There is no workaround currently available.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
