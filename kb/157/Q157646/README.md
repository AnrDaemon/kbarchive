	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange for Windows 95, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When performing a Custom Install to create a client install point on a server,
	even when you uncheck every option, the Setup program continues normally and
	only installs the Exchngcl.stf file. This Exchngcl.stf file is the setup script
	file used during installation to create the client installation point. No error
	message is generated indicating that you should choose one of the clients to
	install.
	
	This behavior is by product design.
