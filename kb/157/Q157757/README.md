	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The color background does not print or appear in page layout view or in print
	preview. It appears correctly in online layout view.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you want to print a color background with a document, use the drawing tools.
	Use the following steps:
	
	1. Open the document in Word.
	
	2. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.
	
	3. On the View menu, click Zoom. Select Whole Page, and then click OK.
	
	4. On the View menu, select Toolbars, and then click Drawing.
	
	5. On the Drawing toolbar, click the Rectangle button (the seventh button on the
	  drawing toolbar). Using the mouse, draw a box the entire size of the page.
	
	6. On the Format menu, click AutoShape. On the Colors and Lines tab, choose a
	  Fill Color, and then choose a Line Color of No Line. On the Wrapping tab,
	  select None for the Wrapping Style. Click OK.
	
	7. Right-click the document page. In the shortcut menu, select Order, and then
	  click Send Behind Text.
	
	8. If you want to add headers and footers to the document, do it now. Otherwise,
	  click the Close button on the Header and Footer toolbar.
	
	You should now have a color background that appears in page layout and print
	preview only, and the color background prints.
	
	NOTE: The area around the edge of the page may not have the color background.
	This is because most printers cannot print right to the edge of the page.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 for Windows provides a new feature: online layout view. This
	view optimizes the layout to make reading online easier. Text appears larger and
	wraps to fit the window, rather than the way it will print. To switch to online
	layout view, click Online Layout on the View menu.
	
	To make your document more visually appealing to read online, you can add
	background colors and textures to it. You can see these backgrounds only in
	online layout view, and you can't print them.
	
	To add a background color for online reading: on the Format menu, select
	Background. Click the color you want.
