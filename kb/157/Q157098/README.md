	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article provides questions and answers to frequently asked questions about
	using page borders in Microsoft Word 97.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. Why don't the borders that I add to my document appear on every page?
	
	  A. If your document contains sections, Word applied the border to the current
	  section only. To apply borders that appear on every page of the document,
	  follow these steps:
	
	  a. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading, and then click the Page
	     Border tab.
	
	  b. In the Apply To list, click Whole Document.
	
	  c. Click OK.
	
	2. Q. Why is the border missing on one or more sides of the page when I print my
	  document?
	
	  A. The minimum amount of space needed between the margin and the edge of the
	  page varies by printer (the distance between the page border and the text may
	  be greater than this margin width). To correct this problem, change the
	  margins of your document.
	
	3. Q. Why are page borders lost when I convert my Word document to HTML?
	
	  A. There is no equivalent element in HTML. To simulate this effect in HTML,
	  create a full page table and apply a border to the table.
	
	4. Q. Why are page borders lost when I convert my Word document to earlier
	  versions of Word or to a non-Word format?
	
	  A. The page borders feature is new to Word 97. It is not supported by
	  converters to earlier versions.
	
	5. Q. Can I add custom border art to the border designs that ship with Word?
	
	  A. No. The border art is stored as a collection of designs in a *.bdr file in
	  the \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Borders subfolder.
	
	  These images are not available in individual graphics formats such as Windows
	  Metafile (WMF), Tag Image File Format (TIFF), or other graphic formats. In
	  addition, you cannot insert these images into a Word document by inserting
	  from a file (on the Insert menu, point to Picture, and click From File).
	
	6. Q. I applied a border to a page, but I don't see it when I am in normal view.
	  Why?
	
	  A. Objects placed on the drawing layer in Word do not appear in normal view.
	  Word displays page borders in print preview or page layout views only.
	
	7. Q. How can I get the page border to move when I adjust the margins?
	
	  A. You can change the page border measurement to be in relation to the text
	  rather than the edge of the page, by following these steps:
	
	  a. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading, and then click the Page
	     Border tab.
	
	  b. Click the Page Border tab.
	
	  c. Click Options.
	
	  d. Change the Measure From setting to Text and click OK.
	
	  The page border should now move with the margins as you adjust the margins.
