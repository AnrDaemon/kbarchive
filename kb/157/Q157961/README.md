	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When Out of Office is enabled, only one reply is sent to each sender, even if
	you receive multiple messages from that person.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Out of Office Assistant sends an automatic reply to notify users who send
	you messages that you are away from the office. Your reply is only sent once to
	a message sender. This is reset when you toggle the Out of Office in the client.
	In other words, Microsoft Exchange clears the internal "sent o" list when you
	disable the Out of Office that is currently enabled.
	
	If you would like to have a reply sent for every message, use Inbox Rules instead
	of Out of Office.
