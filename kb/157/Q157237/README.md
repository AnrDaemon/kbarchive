	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Changes made to the message format of a fax that is sent by printing to the Fax
	printer do not affect the actual fax sent.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This occurs because the fax has already been rendered. Changes made to the
	message format have no effect. The paper size, print quality, and orientation
	are all set by the program used to create the document.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.
