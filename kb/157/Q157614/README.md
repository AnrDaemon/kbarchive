	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you crop a Word Document object, the object's scale changes.
	
	This problem occurs when you attempt to crop an object that you inserted using
	the Object command on the Insert menu, and the object is inline. This problem
	does not occur when the object is floating.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, select the Float Over Text option before you insert
	the Word document object.
	
	NOTE: Adding the Float Over Text property to an inserted inline object does not
	prevent the object from scaling when you crop it.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
