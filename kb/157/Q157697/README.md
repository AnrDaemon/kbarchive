	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If the Windows 95 screen saver starts on top of a Schedule+ appointment
	reminder, you cannot use the keyboard to dismiss the screen saver. However, you
	can still use the mouse to dismiss the screen saver.
	
	This issue has also been reported when using Microsoft Outlook 98.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0
	Windows 95 client. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	All keystrokes used in an attempt to dismiss the screen saver are actually
	processed by the reminder dialog box. Therefore, if you press either the ENTER
	or ESC key, the reminder is removed, and you may miss the appointment
	altogether.
