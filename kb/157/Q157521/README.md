	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The first row of each Agenda Topic on the minutes page created by the Agenda
	Wizard may not align correctly.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, follow these steps:
	
	1. Select the cell that extends past the right edge of the table.
	
	2. On the Table menu, click Cell Height And Width.
	
	3. Click the Column tab. In "Width of Column 3:," change the number to the same
	  value as column 1, and then click OK.
	
	  NOTE: To determine the value of column 1, in the Cell Height And Width dialog
	  box, click the Previous Column button twice. This should give you the value
	  for the "Width of Column 1:." Then click the Next Column button twice to
	  return to the "Width of Column 3:."
	
	4. Repeat this procedure for the first line of each Agenda Topic you may have.
