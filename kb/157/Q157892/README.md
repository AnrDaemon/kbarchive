	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Font changes made to the Delivery Address or the Return Address on the Envelopes
	tab may not be saved between instances of the Envelopes And Labels dialog box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This functionality is by design. You can change the formatting of the current
	envelope Delivery Address or Return Address. If you want the changes to be
	permanent, you need to change the Envelope Address style or Envelope Return
	style.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the following steps to permanently change either the Envelope Address style
	or the Envelope Return style:
	
	1. On the Format menu, click Style.
	
	2. In the Style dialog box, under List, select All styles. Under Styles, select
	  the either the Envelope Address or Envelope Return style, and then click
	  Modify.
	
	3. In the Modify Style dialog box, click to select the Add to template check
	  box, click the Format button, and then click Font.
	
	4. In the Font dialog box, select the font and properties desired.
	
	5. Click OK twice to return to the Style dialog box.
	
	6. Click Close.
