## Q157552: WD97: Fill Color Extends Through Border Formatting

	Article: Q157552
	Product(s): Word 97 for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:97

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you apply a fill color or pattern to a text box that has a double or
	triple-border line style, the fill extends to the outside border of the text
	box. In contrast, when you apply a fill to a table or paragraph bounded by the
	same type of border, the fill does not extend to the outside border.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this, use one of the following methods:
	
	Method 1:
	
	Create three text boxes and layer one on top of the other. Add the fill to the
	text box that appears in front of the other two boxes.
	
	Method 2:
	
	Use a table rather than a text box.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
