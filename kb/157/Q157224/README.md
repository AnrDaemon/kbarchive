## Q157224: WD97: Horizontal Rule and Other Web Elements Limited to 6.5 Inch

	Article: Q157224

	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Word to browse a World Wide Web page that has a horizontal rule,
	the horizontal rule appears to be approximately 6.5 inches long and is aligned
	to the left. In contrast, when you view the same page in a Web browser, such as
	Internet Explorer, the length of the horizontal rule is the full width of the
	screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the converter that Word uses to view a Hypertext
	Markup Language (HTML) document assigns a fixed width for a horizontal rule
	because it can not determine the width of the Word window.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you browse Web pages in Word, the widths of other elements, such as tables
	and marquees, are also limited to 6.5 inches.
