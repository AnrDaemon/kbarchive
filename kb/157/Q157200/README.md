	Product(s): Word 97 for Windows

	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you apply a border to a paragraph that is inside a bordered text box, the
	paragraph border may intersect the right border of the text box. Or, the
	paragraph border may extend beyond the right and left borders of the text box.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, change the left and right indents of the paragraph
	that is inside the text box. This repositions the border to appear inside the
	text box.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The amount by which the paragraph border may overlap the text box borders
	depends on the point size of the line style you used for the border. For
	example, when you use the 1/2-point line style, the paragraph border intersects
	the right border of the text box. When you use a heavier point style, for
	example the 3-point line style or a shadow paragraph border, the left and right
	sides of the paragraph border extend beyond the boundary of the left and right
	sides of the text box.
