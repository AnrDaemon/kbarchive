## Q157741: PPT7: OLE Object Icon Doesn't Display at All Zoom Percentages

	Article: Q157741
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:7.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create a blank slide that contains OLE object placeholders and then
	zoom out to a small zoom percentage, the icons in the placeholders disappear.
	When you zoom in again, the icons reappear.
	
	This effect is most noticeable with the Four Objects AutoLayout.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The icons that appear in placeholders always display the same size on your
	screen regardless of what zoom percentage you are using. PowerPoint does not
	display the icon if the image of your slide is so small that the icon doesn't
	fit entirely within its placeholder (there has to be room for the placeholder
	text, too). The placeholder text appears at all zoom percentages.
