	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the Newsletter Wizard, Word places the mailing and return address
	information in the wrong location in relation to the fold of the printed
	newsletter.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, run the wizard, and then move the address
	information such that it prints above the fold when you fold the printed
	document.
	
	NOTE: The address information is placed inside a table. To move the address
	information, select the table and then cut and paste the table to the
	appropriate location above the fold of the printed newsletter.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
	beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Newsletter Wizard allows you to add mailing address information to the
	newsletter. This is a feature that is not available in earlier versions of the
	Newsletter Wizard.
	
	The Newsletter Wizard places the mailing address information on the last page of
	the document. When you fold the printed document, the address is located below
	the fold.
	
	According to U.S. Postal requirements, the bound edge must be the bottom edge of
	the mailing piece, parallel to the lines of the delivery address. The top edge
	of the mailing piece must be closed.
