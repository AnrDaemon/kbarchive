	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses setting up your joystick, game pad, mouse, or keyboard
	for playing Soccer.
	
	Soccer is easiest to play with game pads such as the Microsoft SideWinder game
	pad or the Gravis Multiport Gamepad, but some computers are not automatically
	compatible with these devices yet.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can set up game pads and joysticks through the Control Panel. For example,
	to set up the Microsoft SideWinder game pad:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Gaming Devices.
	
	3. Select the Microsoft SideWinder game pad from the list of devices.
	
	4. Select Settings and/or Test as needed.
	
	Soccer can also be played with the keyboard and/or mouse. However, when selecting
	your input device(s) from the User Controls screen, you may want to choose the
	Customize button to specify keys and buttons other than the defaults, which are
	listed in the booklet that comes with your Soccer compact disc.
	
	You can change game controls while you are setting up a single, tournament, or
	multiplayer game. However, you cannot change the game controls during a game.
