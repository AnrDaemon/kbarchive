	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Performance Optimizer to analyze drives and suggest which drives
	the databases should be moved to, Performance Optimizer does not check for
	sufficient disk space before suggesting a drive. Sometimes the move to a
	location suggested by Performance Optimizer is unsuccessful because of
	insufficient disk space.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
