	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you manually enter an access number in Connection Settings for MSN, The
	Microsoft Network, MSN may continue to dial the previously used number but
	display the new number in the Sign In screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The access number was not entered in the correct format.

	1. On the Sign In screen, click Settings.
	
	2. Click Access Numbers.
	
	3. In the Primary or Backup number box, type the phone number with the
	  appropriate carrier ID. The correct format is:
	
	  +1 (619) 3380612:<carrier id>
	
	  NOTE: You must enter the area code even if you are using a local number. Not
	  entering the area code will result in the symptoms described above.
	
	  The carrier IDs are as follows:
	
	     AT&T                               :A
