	SUMMARY

	The word administrator is misspelled in the message received by a Microsoft
	Exchange user when they have exceeded their Mailbox storage limit.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If a Microsoft Exchange user exceeds their Mailbox storage limit, they will
	receive a message similar to:
	
	  From: System Administrator
	  Sent: Wednesday, July 10, 1996 8:00 PM
	  To: USERNAME
	  Subject: Your mailbox is over its size limit
	  Importance: High
	
	  You are exceeding the size limit set on your mailbox by the system
	  adminstrator.
	
	  Your mailbox size limit is XXXXX Kbytes
	  You are currently exceeding this limit by XXXXX Kbytes
	
	  You may not be able to send new mail until you reduce your mailbox size. To
	  free up space, delete any items that you are no longer using or move them to
	  your Personal Folders. Items in all of your mailbox folders including the
	  Deleted Items and Sent Items folders count against your size limit. You must
	  empty the Deleted Items folder after deleting items or the space will not be
	  freed.
	
	Please see the Deleted Items Folder Help topic for more information.
