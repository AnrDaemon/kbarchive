	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The slide master may contain objects that are overlapped by the AutoLayout
	placeholders. If you want to adjust the placeholders so that they no longer
	overlap, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, point to Master, and then click Slide Master.
	
	2. Hold down the SHIFT key and click the placeholder that you want to resize or
	  move.
	
	3. Adjust the size of the placeholder by dragging one of the black handles on
	  the placeholder (handles are located at each corner and at the midpoint of
	  each side).
	
	4. To move the placeholder, click the shaded outline and drag it to the desired
	  new position.
	
	With the exception of the Title Slide layout, every slide based on an AutoLayout
	has the placeholders adjusted automatically.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In PowerPoint 4.0, slides based on the Title Slide layout have to be adjusted
	manually for each slide. In PowerPoint 7.0 the Title Master can be adjusted as
	well. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, point to Master, and then click Title Master.
	
	2. If Title Master is unavailable, click Slide Master, then click the New Title
	  Master button at the bottom of the slide.
	
	3. Once in the Title Master, adjust the appropriate placeholder as described in
	  the Summary section of this article.
