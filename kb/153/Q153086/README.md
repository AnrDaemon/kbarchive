	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you spell check a document, the custom dictionary (Custom.dic) file is not
	used when it makes suggestions for misspelled words. This behavior is not
	consistent with Microsoft Word version 7.0, which allows a user the ability to
	include (or exclude) the Custom.dic file for suggestions for misspelled words.
	
	NOTE: The Custom.dic does suggest capitalization changes, but no actual
	misspellings.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The CUSTOM.DIC file may be located in one of the following locations:
	
	  C:\<windows directory>\MSAPPS\PROOF
	
	-or-
	
	  C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof
