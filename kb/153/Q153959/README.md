	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have been invited to attend a meeting and have accepted the meeting
	request, you won't be able to view other attendees.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	After you have received a meeting request and accepted that request, you can't
	view others in attendance by selecting the Attendees tab of the meeting
	properties. When you view the meeting's properties and select the attendees tab,
	nothing will appear in the list. This is by design.
