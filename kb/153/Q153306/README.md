	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are in the design environment placing controls on a form, it is often
	useful to size a set of controls to the same size or align a set of controls to
	the same Top or Left edge. The triple click feature in Visual Basic 4.0 and
	later gives you this functionality. The step-by-step example in this article
	shows how to set the left alignment and size properties for a set of text boxes
	to the same values.

	Step-by-Step Example
	--------------------
	
	1. Start a new Visual Basic project. Form1 is created by default.
	
	2. Place three text boxes on Form1 named Text1, Text2, and Text3.
	
	3. Position and size the text boxes so that they are different sizes and don't
	  line up on the left edge.
	
	4. Select one of the text boxes. Hold down the CTRL key, and click the other two
	  text boxes. All three text boxes should be highlighted.
	
	5. Press F4 to show the Properties window. Go to the Left Property and
	  triple-click the word Left. All the text boxes should now have the same Left
	  property and therefore line up on the left side.
	
	6. In the Properties window, triple-click the word Height, and then triple-
	  click the word Width. All the text boxes will now be the same size.
