## Q153508: DOC: User's Guide Gives Wrong Required Windows NT Version

	Article: Q153508

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows 
	- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Visual SourceSafe User's Guide states that to run on Windows NT that version
	3.5 or later is needed. Visual SourceSafe will run on Windows NT 3.5, but you
	cannot perform the initial installation on Windows NT 3.5 due to the setup
	program, and you must have Windows NT 3.51 or later.
	
	Microsoft is aware of this behavior and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Systems Requirements on the back of the Visual SourceSafe package state that
	Window NT 3.51 or later is required. However, page 3 of the User's Guide, under
	System Requirements, states that Windows NT 3.5 or later is needed. This can
	cause some confusion as to which version of Windows NT Visual SourceSafe needs.
	The answer is that Visual SourceSafe will run under Windows NT 3.5 and you can
	also do a Netsetup to install the client on Windows NT 3.5, but you must have
	Windows NT 3.51 or later if you plan on doing the initial installation under
	Windows NT.
