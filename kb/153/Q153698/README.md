	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you print a Microsoft Word document at 600dpi in either PostScript or PCL,
	and it contains tables, it will create a very large spool file. Microsoft Word
	document tables that have a grid border with a line type of three-quarter point
	dots or dashes will cause the spool file to contain an image; consequently, the
	spool file is very large and takes a long time to generate.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
