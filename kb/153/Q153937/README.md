	SUMMARY

	create a local schedule file (.SCD file). This article describes how to
	subsequently create a local off-line schedule file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you start Schedule+ for the first time, you'll see a Welcome screen that
	gives you the following options for configuring an off-line Schedule file:
	
	I want to create a new schedule file
	
	I want to use an existing schedule file
	
	I do not want a schedule file on this machine
	
	If you choose not to use a schedule file, you will not be presented with this
	dialog box again, unless you reinstall Schedule+.
	
	To create a new off-line .SCD file or use an existing .SCD file, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Open the Schedule+ client.
	
	2. On the Tools menu, click Options.
	
	3. In the Options dialog box, click the Synchronize tab.
	
	4. Click to select the "Work primarily from local file" check box.
	
	This will cause Schedule+ to use a local .SCD file. You will have the opportunity
	to create a new .SCD file or choose an existing .SCD file to use for a local
	schedule file.
