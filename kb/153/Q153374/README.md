	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Certain voice modems may not disconnect immediately if you click the Hang-Up
	button before all digits have been dialed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some modems, if issued both a dial and hang-up command too quickly, fail to
	respond again until the computer is restarted. Microsoft Phone delays sending
	the hang-up command to avoid this problem.
