	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the Japanese version of Windows 95 and MSN, The Microsoft
	Network, and you select a country other than Japan in the Regional Settings tool
	in Control Panel, the access numbers displayed when you click Connection
	Settings in MSN may not be the correct numbers for the selected region. As a
	result, you may inadvertently select a long distance phone number.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click Regional Settings.
	
	2. On the Regional Settings tab, click Japan, and then click OK.
	
	3. Go to Connection Settings and select an access number.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This problem occurs only in MSN 1.0 and is fixed in later versions. Therefore,
	this problem is an issue when you are signing up for MSN using the version of
	MSN included with Windows 95. However, if you select an incorrect access number
	during sign-up and then upgrade to a later version of MSN, MSN continues to dial
	the incorrect access number unless you return to Connection Settings and select
	another access number.
