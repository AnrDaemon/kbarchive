	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
	   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If the host tries to start an outbound bracket while an RUI application is in
	the middle of sending a chain that comprises a single bracket (BBI = BB, EBI =
	EB), the RUI library subsequently rejects the negative response sent by the
	application in response to the SDI message generated by the SNA Server with a
	return code of RESPONSE_REQUIRED.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is due to SNA Server internally changing state to In Bracket during
	reception of the chain.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 2.0, 2.1,
	2.11 and 2.11.sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server
	2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
