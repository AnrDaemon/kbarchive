	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Word displays or prints an embedded object on a single page (even if
	the embedded object could span multiple pages).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In Word, embedded objects are limited to one page.
	
	This behavior is by design. Microsoft Word is unable to divide the display
	representation of embedded objects larger than one page.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Objects of the Word document class display or print one page of an embedded
	object. When double-clicked, the entire object appears in the object window.
	Objects of the Microsoft Excel worksheet class display all of the information in
	the object but truncate the text when printed.
	
	Additional query words: truncated cut off cropped crop chop chopped missing
