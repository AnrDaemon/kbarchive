## Q197009: WD97: Tabs and Paragraph Commands Unavailable in Some Views

	Article: Q197009

	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word, the Tabs and Paragraph commands are unavailable (dimmed) on
	the Format menu in master document or outline view.
	
	In contrast, the Tabs and Paragraph items are available on the list that appears
	when you click Format in the Modify Style dialog box. (To open the Modify Style
	dialog box, click Style on the Format menu and then click Modify.) However, if
	you select Tabs from the list that appears when you click Format, nothing
	happens. If you select Paragraph from the same list, the Format Paragraph dialog
	box appears. If you then click Tabs, however, the Format Tabs dialog box does
	not open, and the Format Paragraph dialog box closes.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The availability of many Word commands depends on settings such as the view you
	select on the View menu or the options you set under the View tab in the Options
	dialog box under the Tools menu. For example, many commands are unavailable if
	you lock your document by clicking the Lock Document button on the Master
	Document toolbar. If a command is inappropriate or not applicable to a
	particular view, it is unavailable when you are in that view.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you want to apply Tabs or direct paragraph formatting, switch to normal or
	page layout view.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are certain direct paragraph formatting commands that you can access, such
	as Borders and Shading, when in outline or master document view. When you select
	the formatting, it is not shown on the screen and is not printed but it is shown
	on the screen in print preview.
