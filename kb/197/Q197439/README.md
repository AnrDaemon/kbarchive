	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you are performing a find-and-replace operation on a selection and choose
	Replace All after having chosen Replace or Find Next, Word continues replacing
	past the selection to the end of the document.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you select a range of text and then, in the Replace dialog box, click Replace
	All or any combination of Replace and Find Next, replacing only takes place
	within the selection. You then see a dialog box asking if you want to continue
	replacing beyond the selection.
	
	If, however, you select a range of text and then click Replace or Find Next,
	followed by Replace All in the Replace dialog box, Word does not stop after the
	selection but replaces to the end of the document.
