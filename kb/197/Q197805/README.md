	=======
	
	This article describes how to use aircraft from Flight Shop and Microsoft Flight
	Simulator in Combat Flight Simulator.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Imported Flight Simulator 98 aircraft and converted Flight Shop or Flight
	Simulator 5.1 or 6.0 aircraft use a default damage profile file (Default.dp)
	that provides generic weapons placement.
	
	Microsoft does not support making changes to the Default.dp file.
	
	NOTE: Microsoft does not support the Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator Converter
	(Cfsconv.exe) included with Combat Flight Simulator, aircraft converted using
	the Combat Flight Simulator Converter, or the use of third-party aircraft in
	Combat Flight Simulator.
	
	If a converted third-party aircraft does not work in Combat Flight Simulator,
	please contact the software manufacturer of the aircraft for support.
	
	To use aircraft from Flight Shop, Flight Simulator 5.1, or Flight Simulator 6.0
	for Windows 95 in Combat Flight Simulator, you must use the Microsoft Flight
	Simulator Converter tool (Cfsconv.exe) to convert the aircraft to a format that
	is compatible with Combat Flight Simulator.
	
	To use aircraft from Flight Simulator 98 in Combat Flight Simulator, copy the
	folder and files for the aircraft into the Combat Flight Simulator\Aircraft
	folder.
	
	To convert or import aircraft from Flight Shop or Flight Simulator, use the
	appropriate method for the version of the aircraft that you want to use.
	
	Flight Shop and Flight Simulator 5.1/6.0 Aircraft

	NOTE: Combat Flight Simulator supports multi-engine instrument panels in
	converted multi-engine aircraft so you can see the instrumentation for all
	engines in the aircraft at once.
	
	To view a multi-engine instrument panel for a converted aircraft, point to
	Instrument Panel on the Views menu, and then click the panel that you want to
	see, or press SHIFT+<number>, where <number> is the number
	associated with that instrument panel. To view the multi-engine instrument panel
	of a converted aircraft based on the Cessna or Lear template, press SHIFT+5. To
