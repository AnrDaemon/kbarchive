	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Word, a password-protected document cannot be recovered if the
	password for that document is lost or forgotten. Microsoft does not offer a
	service to retrieve documents to which passwords have been added, nor does it
	offer any information regarding such services or processes.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This policy is to prevent any damages to Microsoft Word users who rely on the
	security that their passwords provide. To recover a password-protected document,
	you must remember the assigned password.
	
	NOTE: Remember that passwords are case sensitive. If you used a combination of
	uppercase and lowercase letters when you set up your password, you need to use
	the same combination when you use the password to access your document. Also,
	before you type your password, verify that CAPS LOCK is not active.
