	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The ruler in Word 97 is accessible only by using a mouse.
	
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	As the result of customer feedback, Microsoft increased the functionality of the
	ruler starting with Word 6.0. To prevent too much complexity, the additional
	mouse functionality required a loss of keyboard functionality. As a result,
	there is no longer a ruler mode you can activate to allow setting tabs and
	indents directly from the keyboard.
	
	New functions and changes to the ruler:
	
	- The indent and margin modes were combined.
	
	- You automatically switch to table mode when in a table.
	
	- Page layout view now has a vertical ruler.
	
	- You can set all indents using the mouse without keyboard intervention.
	  (Previously you had to hold down the SHIFT key to drag the body indent
	  triangle.)
	
	- You can choose the type of tab from the ruler.
	
	- The visual style has been improved to make it easier to use.
	
	To set all paragraph settings using the keyboard, click either Paragraph or Tabs
	on the Format menu.
