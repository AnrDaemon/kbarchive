{% raw %}

	Article: Q197470
	Product(s): Word 97 for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:97
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Word cannot display all aspects of true WYSIWYG ("what you see is what
	you get") all the time, because the screen resolution is much lower than the
	printer resolution. Words may appear compressed in certain views due to the
	difference in resolution.
	
	NOTE: This is a display problem only. The text is printed correctly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The positions of words on the page and line lengths are exactly preserved in
	Word.
	
	In addition, Word performs smooth letter spacing rather than strictly positioning
	every character according to its exact position on the printer.
	
	Additional query words: scrunched truncated truncate garbled fixed width preportional proportional
