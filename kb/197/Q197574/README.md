	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you finish playing an event in Motocross Madness and you achieve a score
	that is higher than a previously saved track record, the score may not be saved.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you have already saved 10 track records for the event
	and track combination you played.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, delete the saved track records for the event and
	track combination you played. To do this, delete the high score file associated
	with this event and track combination.
	
	The following table lists the high score file names associated with each event
	and track combination.
