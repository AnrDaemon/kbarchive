	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Excel, if you copy cells that are formatted for center or bottom
	vertical alignment, and you paste the cells into a Word document, the height of
	the cell remains the same, but Word places the text at the top of the cell. In
	other words, the vertical alignment formatting is lost.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Versions of Word for Windows earlier than Word 97 do not support vertical
	alignment for table cells. Word 97 does support vertical table cell alignment;
	however, the vertical formatting is lost when cells are pasted from Microsoft
	Excel.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use the Center Vertically button on the Tables And
	Borders toolbar to re-apply the vertical centering. To do this, use the
	following steps:
	
	1. If the Tables And Borders toolbar is not visible, point to Toolbars and click
	  Tables And Borders on the View menu.
	
	2. In the table, select the cells to format for vertical centering.
	
	3. On the Tables And Borders toolbar, click Center Vertically.
