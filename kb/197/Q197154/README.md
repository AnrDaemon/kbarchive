	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you merge revisions or changes between two documents in Microsoft Word, an
	added table in the document being merged causes all revisions following the
	table not to be merged with the original document. When this problem occurs, you
	receive the following error message.
	
	  The merged documents contain unmarked changes. Do you want to merge up to the
	  first untracked change?
	
	If you click OK, Word merges the changes up to the table in the original document
	but does not merge anything after the table. If you click Cancel, Word cancels
	the merge and leaves the two documents in their original state.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
