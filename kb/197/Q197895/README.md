	Article: Q197895

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the HTMLA Web Administration forms in Internet Information Server,
	if you click the properties of a Web site and view the home directory section,
	it appears that you can modify the application starting point entry. However,
	you cannot edit the information found in this field.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The field appears to be modifiable because the Web Administration forms are
	created using HTML 3.0.
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	
	Additional query words: Admin
