	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the Shrink to Fit button on the Print Preview toolbar, Word may
	repaginate your document several times. It may appear that Word is repaginating
	your document in an endless loop.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Sometimes Word must perform several repagination operations to maximally reduce
	the number of pages in a document. If you choose the Shrink to Fit button and
	Word is unable to reduce the number of pages in your document after repaginating
	the document several times, one of the following messages may appear:
	
	  After several attempts, Word was unable to shrink the document by one page.
	
	-or-
	
	  Word could not shrink the document by one page because the document is
	  already one page.
	
	Additional query words: repagination multiple endless loop continuous infinite looping
