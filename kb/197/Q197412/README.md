	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to start Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia after you upgrade
	Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to Microsoft Windows 95/98, you may
	receive the following error message:
	
	  An unknown error has occurred while initializing Encarta Encyclopedia Please
	  restart Windows and try again. If you still have a problem, run Setup again
	  from the CD-ROM.
	
	CAUSE

	  NOTE: If you have the Standard edition of Encarta 97 Encyclopedia, there is
	  only one Encarta CD-ROM.
	
	  If Encarta 97 Encylopedia Setup does not start automatically, follow these
	  steps:
	
	  a. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	  b. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK
	
	        <drive>:\setup.exe
