	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you add headings to a table by clicking Headings on the Table menu, Word
	does not display the headings at the top of each page on which the table appears
	in normal view. Word only displays the headings at the top of the table.
	
	In contrast, Word displays the table headings at the top of each page on which
	the table appears in page layout view or print preview.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you use the Headings command, Word treats the table heading rows like
	headers instead of table rows and, as with normal headers, Word does not display
	them in normal view.
