	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	3-D window 2 is not visible when activated with the ] (right bracket) key in the
	Boeing Field Runway 13R mode. 3-D window 2 has a lower priority in this mode,
	causing it to display behind 3-D window 1.
	
	To make 3-D window 2 topmost, press the ] key followed by the ' (apostrophe)
	key.
