	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	On the altimeter there is a smaller barometric pressure window that reads 3001.
	In Flight Simulator, this window is too small to plot the digits, so the window
	always reads 3001.
	
	MORE INFORMATION

	To adjust barometric pressure, point to the knob marked "A" and click the left
	mouse button, or press A on the keyboard.
