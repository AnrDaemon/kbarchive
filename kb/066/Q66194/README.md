	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Flight Simulator checks for successive physical serial ports when selecting a
	serial port above Com1. For example, to use Com4, the port must be a physical
	port in the computer, and four physical ports must exist in the computer.
	
	Logical serial ports may not be recognized correctly. For example, some internal
	modems can create a logical serial port. Flight Simulator was not tested with
	logical serial ports, and therefore, cannot be guaranteed to function correctly
	with such hardware.
