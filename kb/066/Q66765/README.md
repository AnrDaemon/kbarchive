	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To engage or disengage the thrust reversers, press SHIFT+U.
	
	In early printings of the "Aircraft & Scenery Designer User's Guide," pages
	68 and 74 incorrectly list SHIFT+BACKSPACE as the key combination to disengage
	the thrust reversers. SHIFT+BACKSPACE pans the view for the active window.
