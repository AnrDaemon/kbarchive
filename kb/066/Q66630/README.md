## Q66630: ASD: Flight Timing Gate Scoring

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The timing gate feature of the Aircraft & Scenery Designer functions best
	when gates are placed a fair distance apart. Closely spaced gates (for example,
	1/2 mile) may give confusing statistics.
	
	Example
	-------
	
	Time        Speed        Score
	----        -----        -----
	001.2       246          150
	001.8       289          149
	
	In this example, the second time is slower even though the speed is faster; this
	is due to the way that time and distance are measured by Flight Simulator.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Flight Simulator measures time in 1/18-second intervals. Distance is measured
	each time the screen is updated. The degree of accuracy depends on the speed of
	the computer.
