	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To remove the map (navigation display) from the 747 enhanced control panel in
	Flight Simulator version 4.00 with Aircraft & Scenery Designer, press
	SHIFT+SPACEBAR. This will replace the map with the radio magnetic indicator
	(RMI). If you press SHIFT+SPACEBAR again, the RMI will display with the map
	underneath it.
	
	The navigation display cannot be toggled with NUM LOCK like regular maps. For
	more information concerning the navigation display and the RMI, see page 72 of
	the "Microsoft Flight Simulator Aircraft & Scenery Designer User's Guide."
