	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The label on the 5.25-inch disk of the Windows Entertainment Pack incorrectly
	states that to set up the Entertainment Pack, you should "type SETUP at the
	A:> prompt."
	
	Setup for the Windows Entertainment Pack is Windows based, and should be run from
	within Windows as follows:
	
	1. From the File menu in Program Manager, choose Run.
	
	2. Type "A:SETUP" (without the quotation marks) in the dialog box that appears.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows Entertainment Pack
	version 1.00.
