	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Aircraft & Scenery Designer (ASD) cannot move, alter, or modify any existing
	scenery component of Flight Simulator version 4.00 (or any SubLogic scenery
	disk).
	
	However, additional static and dynamic components can be added to the default
	version 4.00 scenery (or SubLogic scenery) and edited using ASD. For example,
	you can add instrument landing system (ILS) capability to an existing airport.
	
	Most of the Seattle area scenery included with ASD can be edited, because it was
	created using ASD.
