	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Flight Simulator allows unlimited conversion of Sublogic scenery disks for use
	on a hard drive. However, the Scenery Library (option 5, 2) will only list the
	first six converted files.
	
	To access more than six different Sublogic scenery disks from the Scenery
	Library, files must be rearranged. Sublogic scenery files can be stored in
	separate subdirectories and copied to the FS directory as needed to work around
	the six-file limit.
