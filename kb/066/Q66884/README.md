	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	SubLogic makes scenery disks that may be used in place of the default Flight
	Simulator scenery. These scenery disks can be used with Aircraft & Scenery
	Designer (ASD) version 4.00 without any adverse effects. It is therefore
	possible to add scenery to existing SubLogic scenery.
	
	Note that each SubLogic scenery disk varies in its representation of the world.
	This may cause the location of ASD scenery to vary depending on which SubLogic
	scenery is being used.
	
	To avoid discrepancies, load the Scenery disk first, then create custom scenery.
	Use custom scenery only in conjunction with the SubLogic disk it was created
	for.
