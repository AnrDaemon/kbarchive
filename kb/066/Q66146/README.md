	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following are options saved between sessions of Tetris in the Microsoft
	Windows Entertainment Pack volume 1:
	
	  Sound
	  Piece Preview
	  Track High Scores
	  Starting Level
	  Number of Starting Rows
	
	The Option menu's 2-Player mode is not saved between sessions of Tetris. By
	design, Tetris will always start in 1-Player mode because this is more common
	than 2-Player mode.
