	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you run the Learning Microsoft Windows program included in the Microsoft
	Productivity Pack for Windows, you cannot use the CTRL+ESC or ALT+ESC keystrokes
	to switch out of the tutorial. If you attempt to use these keystrokes, you do
	not switch out of the program. Instead, you receive a tutorial message such as
	the following:
	
	  To choose a section of the tutorial, press the number in the upper-left hand
	  corner of the section you want, or click the section. To exit the tutorial,
	  press X.
	
	  -or-
	
	  Press space bar to go on, or hold down the Ctrl key and F1 to see the
	  tutorial controls.
	
	The message varies depending on where you are at in the Learning Microsoft
	Windows tutorial.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Switching out of Learning Windows is not possible because Learning Windows
	utilizes Windows emulators that provide realistic demonstrations and practice
	environments. Because of this architecture, context switching out of Learning
	Windows is not possible. This limitation is also stated in the Learning Windows
	courseware.
