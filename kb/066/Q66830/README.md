	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To clear the current scenery, from the Static Scenery Library, select Create New
	File (press 1, J, 1, K, C). Make sure that the scenery file you want to delete
	is not the active file (shown by a + [plus sign] or listed after number 1);
	otherwise, it will not be deleted.
	
	Follow the menu prompts to enter and save a new scenery filename.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The above steps clear scenery created with the Aircraft & Scenery Designer.
	Remaining scenery is part of the Flight Simulator (FS) default scenery or a
	SubLOGIC scenery disk. For example, creating a new scenery file while at Boeing
	Field removes the gray runway, but not Mt. Rainier. Mt. Rainier is part of the
	FS version 4.00 default scenery.
