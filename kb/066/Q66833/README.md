	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	With the 747 panel, the NAV1 radio is normally used to track the localizer and
	glideslope for Instrument Landing System (ILS) landings. The NAV2 radio is used
	to track VORs because it has a special needle on the navigation display that
	points directly toward the VOR station.
	
	If you want to track a VOR with the NAV1 radio, you must use the localizer
	located below the attitude indicator. To the right of the localizer is a TO-FROM
	indicator. The NAV1 course selector knob is located at the top left of the panel
	next to the NAV1 frequency. It is labeled "OBS" (Omni-Bearing Selector).
	
	These gauges are used together just as the Cessna panel's Omni- Bearing Indicator
	(OBI) is used. This procedure is described on page 116 of the "Microsoft Flight
	Simulator Information Manual and Flight Handbook" for version 4.00.
