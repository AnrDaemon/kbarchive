	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The runways at some airports, such as O'Hare International, are displayed as
	green with white outlines. Not all runways are gray, as in the Chicago Meigs
	field scenery.
	
	In Flight Simulator 4.00, some airports are not defined with the same runway
	detail as the Chicago Meigs field runway.
