	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When running Flight Simulator 3.x or 4.x on a system with a liquid- crystal VGA
	display, choose option D [Liquid Crystal Display (CGA)] when you're asked what
	display type is being used in the Flight Simulator start-up menus.
	
	Currently, CGA is the highest resolution supported by Flight Simulator on
	liquid-crystal displays (LCDs).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For example, when Flight Simulator is run on an NEC ProSpeed 386 laptop with VGA
	LCD display, and option M (VGA 16 color 640 x 350 Enhanced) is chosen, pull-down
	menu options are not visible in Flight Simulator, and the sky will appear black.
	Using display option D corrects these problems.
