	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Windows version 3.0 runs properly in all modes on a computer using the
	OptiStar WORM driver version 4.01. OptiStar drivers, which are made by Corel
	Corporation, are used on a wide variety of WORM optical drives. WORM drives
	(Write Once Read Many) are SCSI host-adapter drives used for permanent storage
	of data. Data is "burned" onto the removable optical disk.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Attempting to access the drive while running the driver version 3.01 under
	Windows in enhanced mode returns the error "This application has violated system
	integrity." Upgrading your OptiStar software to version 4.01q (or later) should
	resolve this problem.
