	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When the IdleWild screen saver blanks the screen under Windows, the mouse
	pointer is not concealed, and will be the same shape that it was when the screen
	blanked.
	
	If the mouse is moved after IdleWild blanks the screen, the movement will be
	detected and the normal screen will be restored. IdleWild has no effect on the
	mouse cursor.
