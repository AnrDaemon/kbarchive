	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows Entertainment Pack Volume 1 game Minesweeper presents you with a
	grid-like mine field, with your objective being to locate all of the mines as
	quickly as possible. To accomplish this task, you step on uncovered squares by
	clicking the active mouse button, either revealing a number, a blank space, or a
	mine.
	
	The number represents the amount of mines located in the eight squares
	surrounding the number. A blank space will clear a specific area, revealing
	either numbers or more blank spaces. A mine means that you are dead and the game
	is over.
	
	If you think you know where a mine is located, you can click the opposite mouse
	button to mark that cell with a flag. The counter in the upper left-hand corner
	keeps track of how many mines are still available. Minesweeper gives you three
	options of play: Beginner, which is an 8 x 8 grid with 10 mines; Intermediate,
	which is a 16 x 16 grid with 40 mines; and Expert, which is a 16 x 30 grid with
	99 mines. Also available is a custom option that allows grids anywhere from 8 x
	8 to 24 x 30, with mines ranging from 10-667.
