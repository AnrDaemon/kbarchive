	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	It is not possible to run two or more different Windows applications with the
	same executable filename at the same time. When you attempt to start the second
	application, an additional instance of the first application is started instead.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior occurs when you attempt to run different versions of the same
	program at the same time, such as Microsoft Excel 2.10c and 2.10d. Renaming one
	of two versions of the same application to a different name gives you the same
	results.
	
	Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a win30
