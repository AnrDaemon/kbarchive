	=======
	
	Page 14 of the "Microsoft Flight Simulator, Aircraft & Scenery Designer
	User's Guide" for version 4.00 states the following:
	
	  While working in the Static Scenery Designer, press the BACKSLASH key to
	  switch to the Design Preferences Menu.
	
	This information is incorrect. You should press FORWARD SLASH to switch to the
	Design Preferences menu, not BACKSLASH.
