	INSTALLING AND RUNNING MICROSOFT PRODUCTIVITY PACK FOR WINDOWS
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Set Up & Learn
	--------------
	
	Start by setting up Microsoft Productivity Pack for Windows on your
	computer's hard disk.
	
	Caution: Do not try to set up Learning Windows while using Windows.
	You must quit Windows before using Setup.
	
	1. Turn on your computer.
	
	2. When you see the DOS prompt on the screen (C>, for example),
	  insert the disk labeled Disk 1-Setup into Drive A.
	
	3. To change from Drive C to Drive A, type "a:" (without the quotation
	  marks) and then press the ENTER key.
	
	4. At the DOS prompt (A>, for example), type "setup" (without the
	  quotation marks) and then press the ENTER key. Follow the
	  instructions on your screen to complete set up.
	
	Now Begin Learning
	------------------
	
	Learning Windows, an online tutorial, makes it fun to become a Windows
	user. Start the tutorial by double-clicking the open book icon in the
	Productivity Pack group window. After reading the welcome screen of
	the tutorial, click the Getting Started box.
	
	If you haven't used a computer before, begin with lesson one,
	"Introducing Windows," and complete each lesson in order.
	
	If you have used a computer before, be sure to read, "Getting the most
	from this tutorial" to find out how to tailor this tutorial to your
	needs.
	
	You can complete an entire lesson, watch only the demo, do the
	practice, or skip straight to the summary. Click the tutorial controls
	in the lower right-hand corner of the screen to move around easily
	within a lesson.
	
	Solve & Improve
	---------------
	
	Got a problem?
	
	If you have a problem using Windows with your printer, your network,
	or an application, you might find the answer to your problem in Quick
	Troubleshooter. Double-click the target icon in the Productivity Pack
	group window to start Quick Troubleshooter.

	to suit your work style. Double-click the owl icon in the Productivity
	Pack group window to start Working Smarter.
	
	PROBLEMS RUNNING SETUP IN REAL MODE IN WINDOWS VERSION 3.0
	----------------------------------------------------------
	
	If you run Windows version 3.0 in real mode, you may see the message
	"Cannot open program group file" while Setup is trying to install
	groups into Program Manager.
	
	To continue installing Productivity Pack, exit the Setup program and
	delete some of the groups in Program Manager. Then run Setup again.
	
	COMPRESSED FILES ON THE SETUP DISKS
	-----------------------------------
	
	Most of the files on the Setup disks are compressed. These files
	are not usable until they are expanded and copied to your hard
	disk by Setup. The compressed files have file extensions that
	end with $.
	
	USING THE LEARNING WINDOWS TUTORIAL
	-----------------------------------
	
	This section describes some problems you might have running the
	Learning Windows tutorial.
	
	TSRs
	----
	
	Terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) interfere with Learning
	Windows. You should not activate a TSR while running Learning Windows.
	
	386 Enhanced-Mode Application Shortcut Keys
	-------------------------------------------
	
	386 enhanced-mode application shortcut keys can interfere with
	Learning Windows. You should not switch to a non-Windows application
	by pressing an application shortcut key while running Learning
	Windows.
	
	Toshiba T-5100 Laptop Computer
	------------------------------
	
	If you start Learning Windows on a Toshiba T-5100 laptop, and cannot
	see any instructions on the screen, try changing your display driver
	from EGA (the suggested driver) to COMPAQ Portable Plasma. This driver
	will not work properly in 386 enhanced mode, so you must start Windows
	in real mode or standard mode.
	
	To start Windows in real mode or standard mode:
	
	1. Quit Windows.
	
	2. At the DOS prompt, type one of the following:
	
	     Type This       To Run in this Mode
	     ---------       -------------------
	
	     win /r          real mode
	     win /s          standard mode
	
	3. Press ENTER.
