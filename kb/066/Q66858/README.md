	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When the Drop Out screen saver is selected in the Windows Entertainment Pack
	IdleWild game on a computer running Microsoft Windows in standard or 386
	enhanced mode with a Radius two-page display, the screen saver will terminate
	with an Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE) as soon as the screen saver is
	activated.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
