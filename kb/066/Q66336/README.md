	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Unlike Flight Simulator, proper installation of Aircraft & Scenery Designer
	(ASD) requires that you run an Install program. If the contents of the ASD Disk
	are copied directly to the Flight Simulator directory, the Flight Simulator
	program will appear unchanged. When properly installed, the Mode menu (1)
	contains option I for Aircraft Design and option J for Scenery Design.
