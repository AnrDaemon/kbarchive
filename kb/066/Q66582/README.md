	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you place custom navigational aids with Flight Simulator Aircraft &
	Scenery Designer (ASD), the following accuracies can be expected:
	
	Navigational Aid      North/South      East/West
	----------------      -----------      ---------
	VOR                   128 meters       1 meter
	ILS                   No variance      No variance
	NDB                   No variance      No variance
	Audible markers       128 meters       128 meters
	
	Using the Longitude/Latitude feature may introduce additional variance due to the
	complexity of the conversion algorithm. The Flight Simulator coordinate system
	provides the highest degree of accuracy.

	================
	
	To confirm the positional accuracy of navigational aids, use the following
	steps:
	
	1. Boot Flight Simulator 4.00 with ASD.
	
	2. Press 1 (Mode).
	
	3. Press J (Scenery Design).
	
	4. Press 1 (Static Scenery).
	
	5. Press C (Add Buildings, Objects).
	
	6. Press A (Total Length) and type 100.
	
	7. Press ENTER.
	
	8. Press B (Total Width) and type 100.
	
	9. Press ENTER twice.
	
	10. Press A (to add object).
	
	11. Press ESC.
	
	12. Press H (Add Navigational Aids).
	
	13. Press 1 (to choose navigational aid).
	
	14. Press ENTER.
	
	15. Press A (to add Navigational aid).
	
	16. Press ESC.
	
	17. Press J (Edit Static Scenery).
	
	18. Press A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and I (do NOT press H).
	
	19. Press TAB (Find Next Object).
	
	The navigational aid just created should be selected. Note the location of the
	navigational aid in relation to the building. Knowing that the building is
	100-by-100-feet square, you can estimate the placement accuracy.
