	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When a layer of scattered or broken clouds is set up under an overcast layer,
	the overcast layer will disappear. Once enough altitude is obtained to enter the
	overcast layer, white flashes will appear on the windshield approximately every
	two or three seconds.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Set a bottom-level layer of broken or scattered clouds from 1000 to 1500
	  feet.
	
	2. Set a top-level layer of overcast clouds from 1700 to 2000 feet.
	
	3. Take off and climb above 1700 feet.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 4.00. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
