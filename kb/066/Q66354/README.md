	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows Entertainment Pack Volume 1 game Taipei is a modern, solitaire
	version of the ancient oriental game Mah-Jongg. The game begins with one of
	seven different configurations of tiles, with the object of the game being to
	remove all of the tiles from the playing area by matching identical tiles
	together.
	
	If a tile is available to be chosen, the mouse pointer will turn into a cross
	when it is positioned over that specific tile. There is a solution to every
	game, and there are a total of 32,767 different configurations. Taipei gives you
	the option to backup if you want to change prior moves, bring up old games by
	typing in the game number, and Taipei will even give you a hint on your next
	move when you press the H key.
