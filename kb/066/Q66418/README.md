	One-key macros can be used to allow single keys to function as two
	keys pressed simultaneously (for example, SHIFT+CTRL). This ability
	may be of particular interest to people unable to press more than one
	key at a time.
	
	For example, a macro can be used to execute the CTRL+ESC key
	combination when you press the F11 key, which is rarely used by
	applications.
	
	A macro file containing such a macro, or a collection of similar
	macros, can be entered on the LOAD= or RUN= line of the WIN.INI file,
	allowing the macros to be immediately available upon entering Windows.
