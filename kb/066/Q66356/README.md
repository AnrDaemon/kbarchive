	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The object of Windows Entertainment Pack Volume 1 Tetris is to manipulate
	falling blocks in order to form solid rows. Once a solid row is formed it
	vanishes, thus allowing the player to extend his or her session. The game ends
	when there is a stack of blocks at the top of the playing area.
	
	Blocks can be manipulated by using the arrow keys to move right to left and down,
	and the 5 key on the numerical keypad or the UP ARROW key to rotate the blocks
	counter clockwise. As your skill increases, the speed of the falling blocks
	increases.
	
	This game is for one or two players.
