	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you configure Office version 4.3 as a shared application and initially
	install it, the Clipart Gallery is downloaded the first time you imbed a
	picture. After the Clipart Gallery is downloaded, an ARTGALRY.INI file is
	created on your client computer to point to the local copy. However, if you quit
	Windows, restart Windows, start an Office application, and choose to embed
	clipart, the Clipart Gallery is downloaded again.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
