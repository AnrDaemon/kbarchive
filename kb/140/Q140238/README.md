	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Mastering Visual FoxPro demos and video clips exhibit erratic behavior, or demos
	or expert point of view video clips do not run.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Mastering Visual FoxPro is incompatible with some features of video cards such
	as the Mach32 chip set running the ATI drivers.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	For Mastering Visual FoxPro to run on the ATI driver, set the 256 color palette
	control in the Advanced features of the ATI Control Panel to ON. If you still
	encounter some problems, try installing the Microsoft Super VGA driver.

	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	REFERENCES
	==========

	driver. See your Windows documentation for more information on the Microsoft
	Super VGA driver.
