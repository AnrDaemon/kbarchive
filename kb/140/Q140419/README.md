	Article: Q140419
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:3.51,4.0
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When shutdown is initiated on a Windows NT computer running TCP/IP, Name Release
	notification for NetBIOS Names used by the Workstation Service
	COMPUTERNAME<00>, Messenger service COMPUTERNAME<03> and the
	Domain<1C> are never sent to the WINS server.
	
	WINS displays these names as active when in fact the computer was shut down.
	Proper registration and release of names help avoid WINS replication problems.
