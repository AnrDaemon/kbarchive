	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Lines appear next to slides on printed handouts, but the lines do not appear on
	the Handout Master.
	
	The lines appear by design. The seven lines appear next to the slides so notes
	can be made on the handouts. They do not appear on the Handout Master and appear
	only when you print handouts (three slides per page).
