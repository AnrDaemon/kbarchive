	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Systems Management Server, if there are only two items in the XNF file list
	box, the scroll arrows are very small and difficult to see. When you add more
	items, the scroll arrows get larger, but only two items show up in the list box.
	We can scroll down, but we should expect to see more than just two items.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2.
