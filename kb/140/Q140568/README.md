	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you manually adjust the free space on a compressed drive using DriveSpace 3,
	the amount of free space reported may be only half the amount you specified.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if you are using the No Compression (Fastest) option in
	DriveSpace 3.

	To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:
	
	- Adjust the free space using the Adjust Free Space slider in DriveSpace 3.
	
	- Do not use the No Compression (Fastest) option. Instead, use the HiPack or
	  Standard compression method. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	  1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
	     System Tools, and then click DriveSpace.
	
	  2. On the Advanced menu, click Settings.
	
	  3. Click either the HiPack or Standard compression option.
	
	  4. Click OK.
	
	  5. Adjust the free space again.
