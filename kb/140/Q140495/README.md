	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In regard to future development, Microsoft Corporation does not plan to release
	any new versions of ODBC components for 16-bit Windows operating systems. For
	all outstanding issues with ODBC components that occur on 16- bit platforms, the
	following procedure for problem resolution will occur:
	
	1. Microsoft Product Support Services will assist customers with identifying and
	  isolating problems they are having with ODBC 16-bit components.
	
	2. If Microsoft Corporation identifies a problem to be isolated within an ODBC
	  16-bit component, Microsoft will attempt to replicate the problem behavior
	  with the latest released versions of ODBC 32-bit components.
	
	3. If Microsoft Corporation identifies a problem to be isolated within an ODBC
	  32-bit component, it will proceed to resolve that issue in the 32- bit
	  component. Upon request of the customer, Microsoft will attempt within the
	  best of its resources to provide customers with workarounds within the 16-bit
	  ODBC environment, but please note that the recommended resolution for all
	  problems identified in a 16-bit ODBC component which are resolved in a 32-bit
	  ODBC component will be to migrate to the 32-bit ODBC component.
