	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The help file for Microsoft TCP/IP-32 contain an entry in the help topics
	called: "SNMP, Installing and Configuring," but the instructions for installing
	SNMP are left out.

	or Windows NT Server comes with a SNMP agent.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft TCP/IP-32. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
