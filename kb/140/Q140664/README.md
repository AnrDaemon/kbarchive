	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses troubleshooting steps you can try when you have sound
	problems with any of the products listed at the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Common areas to check when you troubleshoot sound problems include the
	following:
	
	Sound Control Panel Setting
	---------------------------
	
	Verify that the Sound Control Panel volume is set to maximum. Also check the
	following:
	
	1. Open the Sound Control Panel.
	
	2. Select Sound In from the drop down menu.
	
	3. Press the Options button.
	
	4. Under Input Source, select both Internal CD and Playthrough.
	
	Virtual Memory
	--------------
	
	Try running your Macintosh with virtual memory reduced or turned off.
	
	To change the virtual memory setting, do the following:
	
	1. On the Apple menu, point to Control Panels, and then click Memory.
	
	2. For programs designed for the Power Macintosh, reduce the amount given to
	  Virtual Memory to the lowest setting allowed. For non-Power Macintosh
	  programs turn Virtual Memory off.
	
	3. Close the Memory control panel and then restart the computer.
	
	Low Memory Situation
	--------------------
	
	- Free up available memory by quitting all other programs.
	
	- Reset your display to a different color depth monitor. For example, instead
	  of running millions of colors, select 256 colors. You can change this setting
	  in your Monitor Control Panel.
	
	- Allocate additional memory to the program.
	
	  To assign more memory to the program you are using:
	
	  1. Restart the Macintosh.
	
	  2. On the Apple menu, click About This Macintosh.
	
	  3. Note the Largest Unused Block entry.
	
	  4. Locate the program on your hard disk.
	
	  5. Click the program icon to select the program.
	
	  6. On the File menu, click Get Info.
	
	  7. Change the number next to Preferred (or Current) size, so this number does
	     not exceed the number you noted in step 3 above.
	
	Audio playback problems due to a low memory may affect all Macintosh models.
	However, Audio playback problems caused by hardware limitations are most common
	on Macintosh models utilizing a 20MHz 68030 processor or lower.
	
	Extensions Conflict
	-------------------
	
	Restart the computer with only the extension items the system needs to mount the
	CD-ROM drive and the extension items the product requires.
	
	For additional information, refer to the product's Readme file for a list of
	required extension items.
	
	Incorrect Version of Sound or Sound Manager
	-------------------------------------------
	
	Check the version of Sound or Sound Manager that the program you are using
	requires, and validate that you have the correct version installed in your
	Extensions folder.
	
	For additional information, refer to the product's Readme file.
	
	Slow CD-ROM Drive
	-----------------
	
	Check to ensure that all cables are connected correctly and that the CD-ROM drive
	is running optimally.
	
	Apple Updates
	-------------
	
	There have been several reliability and performance enhancements added since
	System 7.5.3 that improve performance, particularly on launch and when switching
	between applications. If you already own System 7.5.3, these updates are
	available for download at no charge from the following Apple sites:
