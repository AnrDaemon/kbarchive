	Article: Q140941

	Keyword(s): kbusage
	Last Modified: 15-MAR-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Exchange version 4.0, the Microsoft Exchange client does not
	display which version of the client (US, French, German, International, and so
	forth) is installed. This makes assessing whether the installed client complies
	with current US export law (regarding encryption methods) more difficult.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
	version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
	in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 2. For information on
	obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
	
	  S E R V P A C K
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Once the service pack is applied, you can view the currently installed version
	by clicking the Tools menu, clicking Options, and clicking the Security tab. It
	will be reported as either the "North American version" or the "International
	version".
