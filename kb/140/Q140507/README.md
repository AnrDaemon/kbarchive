	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Golf for Windows, multimedia edition, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article gives instructions for a minimal installation of Golf.
	
	An installation of the multimedia edition of Microsoft Golf requires a minimum of
	10 megabytes (MB) of hard disk space. More space may be necessary, depending on
	the Setup options you select and the version of Windows installed on your
	computer.
	
	The Setup program gives you the option to install only required Golf elements on
	your computer and access additional information such as courses, tips, tours,
	and flybys from the compact disc.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To perform a minimum installation of Golf, do the following:
	
	1. Start Setup. Setup might start automatically if you have Windows 95 and
	  CD-ROM software that supports Autorun. If it does not start automatically,
	  follow the Setup instructions included with the compact disc.
	
	2. Click Custom Installation.
	
	3. Remove the check mark from the Help and Demos check mark box.
	
	4. Remove the check mark from Firestone Course check mark box.
	
	5. Remove the check mark from the Torrey Pines Course check mark box.
	
	6. If you are using Windows 95, remove the check mark from the PlayerNet check
	  mark box.
	
	  NOTE: PlayerNet must be installed if you plan to use the game over a network.
	
	Setup creates a file called msglfcrs.ini located in the folder where you
	installed Microsoft Golf. This .ini file is used to keep track of the locations
	of courses, tips, flybys, tours and demos.
	
	The compact disc must be in the CD-ROM drive to access any Golf features that you
	do not install on your computer.
