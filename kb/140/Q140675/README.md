	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On your Windows NT version 3.51 computer, when you connect to an OS/2 1.3 LAN
	Manager version 2.2b server and view a directory in File Manager, not all files
	are displayed. At the command line, if you execute the DIR command on this
	directory, a "File not found" error message appears.
	
	This only happens when there are many files in the directory (>1000) and only
	with a distinct number of files. The number of files differ from one Windows NT
	boot to the next.
