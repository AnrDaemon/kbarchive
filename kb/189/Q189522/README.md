	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On a computer that does not have Remote Access Service (RAS) installed,
	including a network drive letter in the System Path variable may cause an SMB
	search request for Rasadhlp.dll. This only happens when GetHostByName() is
	invoked from a sockets application such as ping. On a computer that does have
	RAS installed, you may see a search request for Rtutils.dll.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	WinSock2 tries to load the RAS auto dial helper dll without checking if RAS is
	running or not.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
