	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Adding a large number of DHCP reservations (570+) in a single scope will cause
	one client to disappear from the list of Active Leases. This makes the client
	unmanageable from DHCP Manager. The Resource Kit utility, Dhcpcmd.exe, also
	fails to list reservations beyond the 570th one.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Windows NT 4.0 DHCP service and management tools exhibited a problem with
	enumerating large numbers of clients.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
