	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the installation program for the online book from the \Ebook
	folder, the installation program title will be "Running Microsoft Office 97,
	Updated Edition," not "Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications."
	
	The icon created on your desktop will be labeled "Running Microsoft Office 97,
	Updated Edition."
	
	In the Add/Remove Programs applet of the Control Panel, the program will appear
	as "Running Microsoft Office 97, Updated Edition."
	
	If you run the electronic book from the "Running Microsoft Office 97, Updated
	Edition" icon, the "Microsoft Manual of Style" electronic book will appear and
	run normally.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The title string was incorrectly set in the installation program for the
	electronic book.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To change the icon so that it reads correctly, follow these steps:
	
	1. Right click the "Running Microsoft Office 97, Updated Edition" icon.
	
	2. Click Rename.
	
	3. Type "Microsoft Manual of Style" (without the quotation marks) and then press
	  ENTER.
	
	To uninstall the program, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Click Add/Remove Programs.
	
	3. In Add/Remove Programs, click to select "Running Microsoft Office 97, Updated
	  Edition" and then click Add/Remove.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Manual of Style for
	Technical Publications, Second Edition.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can still run the Microsoft Manual of Style electronic book without any
	problems. The information on the CD-ROM is for the Microsoft Manual of Style,
	not for "Running Microsoft Office 97, Updated Edition." Only the installation
	program is incorrect.
