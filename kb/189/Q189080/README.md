{% raw %}

	Article: Q189080
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): WinNT:4.0
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When transferring large amounts of TCP data between two computers, the
	connection may be aborted. This has been observed primarily in multiple vendor
	networks when interoperating with other operating systems and TCP stacks.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Windows NT 4.0 TCP stack may get out of sequence. Examination of a network
	trace shows TCP sequencing and windowing problems. After sequencing is lost, the
	TCP connection is reset.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
