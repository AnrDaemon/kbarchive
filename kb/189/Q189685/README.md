	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click a menu item on any article screen in Microsoft Encarta, the
	program may stop responding (hang).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the versions of the Mfc40.dll and Msvcrt40.dll files
	installed on your computer do not match, or if either file is missing or
	damaged.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, download and install the Windows Libraries Update. To do
	this:
	
	1. Visit the following Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.asp?
	
	2. In the Search By area, click Keywords.
	
	3. In the Keywords box, type "libraries update" (without the quotation marks).
	
	4. In the Operating System box, click the appropriate operating system, and then
	  click Find It.
	
	5. Click the link that is returned, and then follow the instructions on the
	  screen to install the Microsoft Libraries Update.
	
	The Microsoft Libraries Update resolves an issue that can cause some third-party
	software to behave unexpectedly after the installation of Microsoft Works Suite
	99, Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 99 (US only), Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe
	99, Microsoft Graphics Studio Greetings 99, or other third-party software.
