	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Page 82-83: IERemove.exe is not included in IE4 SP1 or later
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Page 82-83:
	
	The project editors have reported that IERemove.exe is not included in IE4 SP1 or
	later. References to this tool should be eliminated from future editions of the
	Resource Kit, or a note added to the text indicating that the tool is not
	included in IE4 SP1 or later.
	
	
	Page 83: First paragraph, delete third sentence
	-----------------------------------------------
	
	Page 83, first paragraph:
	States that when ieremove.exe is run, an uninstall log.txt is created. This is
	incorrect. IERemove does not create a log file.
	
	Delete third sentence:
	"When it is run, an uninstall log.txt is created."
	
	
	Page 404: Editable and Installable Font Descriptions Switched
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Page 404, bullet points 3 and 4:
	Change to read as follows:
	
	- Installable fonts can be embedded without the restrictions imposed on print
	  and preview fonts. These fonts are installed in users' fonts folder.
	
	- Editable fonts are treated as installable fonts by Internet Explorer 4, but
	  editable fonts will not be installed in a user's fonts folder. This helps
	  prevent users' fonts folders from becoming filled with fonts that they do not
	  want.
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
