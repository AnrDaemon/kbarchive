	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you drag your pointer to build a wall in Age of Empires, your villagers may
	build the wall in the opposite direction from the direction in which you dragged
	the pointer. In addition, the wall may extend to the far side of the map.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur when you attempt to build a wall if you drag the pointer
	into the black border that surrounds the game screen.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This issue is resolved by the Microsoft Age of Empires 1.0c update file.
	
	For additional information about how to obtain this update file, click the

	To work around this problem, when you build a wall, do not drag the pointer into
	the black border that surrounds the game screen.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Age of Empires
	versions 1.0, 1.0a, and 1.0b.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Before your workers finish building a section of wall, you can delete it. To
	delete a section of wall before your villager finish building it, click the
	section of wall, and then press DELETE. The building site disappears, and the
	game returns half of the materials used to build the wall to your stockpile.
