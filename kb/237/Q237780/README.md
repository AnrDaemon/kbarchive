	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run a program that uses a Graphics Device Interface (GDI) subsystem on
	a computer running Windows NT 4.0 in VGA mode, the computer may stop responding
	(hang) and the following error message may be displayed:
	
	  Access to invalid address.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the GDI code directs two rectangles to converge in
	an empty intersection, and the two rectangles appear as a very large, single
	rectangle to the video adapter driver.
