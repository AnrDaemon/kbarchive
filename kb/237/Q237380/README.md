	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use a shortcut key to start a program, the wrong program may start or
	no program may start.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the same shortcut key is assigned to more than one
	program. There is no warning message to indicate that a shortcut key is already
	assigned to another program.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, change the shortcut keys for the affected programs so
	they are not the same.
