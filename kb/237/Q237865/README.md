	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you make changes to a folder's appearance, and then you open another
	folder, the folder you opened does not use the changes you made.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this behavior, follow these steps:
	
	1. Double-click My Computer.
	
	2. Change the folder's appearance.
	
	3. Press and hold down CTRL+SHIFT, and then click the X in the upper-right
	  corner of the window.
	
	4. Open the folder again. When you open another folder from this folder the
	  settings you use are retained in the new folder.
