	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open an article in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2000, the article may
	take an unexpectedly long time to appear on the screen or the program may stop
	responding.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the microprocessor (CPU) installed in your computer
	meets or only barely exceeds the minimum system requirements needed to run
	Encarta Encyclopedia 2000.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, install a faster microprocessor in your computer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia
	2000.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If a CD-ROM changer is installed in your computer, you may be able to improve
	performance by inserting only one Encarta Encyclopedia compact disc in the
	CD-ROM changer at any one time.
	
	When you are prompted to insert the other Encarta Encyclopedia CD-ROM into the
	CD-ROM drive, remove the Encarta CD-ROM that is currently in the CD-ROM changer
	before you insert the other disc.
