	- Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2000 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you start Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2000 Deluxe Edition with both
	compact discs inserted in a CD-ROM changer and then attempt to remove one of the
	compact discs, you may be prompted to insert a compact disc.
	
	When you insert the compact disc in the CD-ROM changer, the screen on your
	computer may turn white and remain white for a long time before it is redrawn.
	
	NOTE: This prompt is often preceded by a blue screen. In addition, you may be
	prompted to insert the compact disc that remains in the CD-ROM changer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you remove the compact disc from the drive in the
	CD-ROM changer that is not in use.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent this issue from occurring, use one of the following methods:
	
	- If you start Encarta Encyclopedia 2000 Deluxe Edition with both compact discs
	  inserted in the CD-ROM changer, do not remove either of the compact discs
	  until you quit the program.
	
	- If you start Encarta Encyclopedia 2000 Deluxe Edition with only one compact
	  disc inserted in the CD-ROM changer, use this drive exclusively while you run
	  the program. If you are prompted to insert the other Encarta disc, eject the
	  inserted compact disc and replace it with the disc you are prompted to
	  insert.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia
	2000.
