	- Microsoft NFL Fever 2000, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the Flee Flicker play in Microsoft NFL Fever 2000, you may be
	unable to follow the execution of the play well enough to manipulate the play
	manually before it is completed by default.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the speed of the game is set to Medium or High.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, set the speed of the game to Low:
	
	1. On the Main screen, click Options, and then click Settings.
	
	2. Next to "Speed of Play," click to select Low.
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Flee Flicker play involves a feigned end run by the halfback who stops
	suddenly after several steps, pivots 180 degrees, and passes the ball back to
	the quarterback.
	
	The halfback performs this action so quickly that you may be unable to track the
	ball carrier and play direction before the play is completed by default.
	
	NOTE: You may be unable to follow the execution of any play that involves a
	sudden, quick reversal of play direction, such as that which occurs in the Flee
	Flicker play.
