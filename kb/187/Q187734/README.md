	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view the WINS database with the WINS Administration utility, you may
	see a large number for the Highest ID that is not completely visible on the
	screen. Although this does not appear to be causing problems, it makes WINS
	troubleshooting very difficult.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the
	following fix, or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
	
	Windows NT 4.0
	--------------
	
	This fix should have the following time stamp:
	
	  10/29/97  05:03p               254,224 Winsadmin.exe  (Intel)
	  10/29/97  05:00p               406,800 Winsadmin.exe  (Alpha)
	
	NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying this
	fix.
	
	Windows NT 3.51
	---------------
	
	This fix should have the following time stamp:
	
	  11/18/97 01:17p               183,808 Winsadmin.exe  (Intel)
	  11/18/97 01:16p               254,224 Winsadmin.exe  (Alpha)

	fix.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and
	4.0.
	
	
	A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
	should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
	are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
	wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
