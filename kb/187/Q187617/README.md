	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Chapter 12 of "Microsoft Office 97 Integration Step by Step," deals with
	publishing Office documents on the World Wide Web, and makes extensive use of a
	program called Microsoft FrontPage. A note on page 236 states that you can
	download FrontPage from a Microsoft Web site. However, the Web site does not
	include an area to download FrontPage.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Microsoft has recently changed its distribution policies for FrontPage.
	FrontPage is no longer available as a free download from the Web.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	As of June 10, 1998, Microsoft is currently offering a 45-day trial version of
	Microsoft FrontPage 98. This trial version offers the full functionality of
	FrontPage, but will expire 45 days after the program is installed.
	
	For information on the trial version of FrontPage, please see the FrontPage Web
	site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/FrontPage/
	
	NOTE: Because the trial version of FrontPage currently offered is FrontPage 98,
	not FrontPage 97, there may be some differences between the product and the
	description in the text.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft Press has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Office 97
	Integration Step by Step."
