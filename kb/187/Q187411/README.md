	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You are unable to drag the Outlook shortcut and Install IIS shortcut using the
	right mouse button and choosing Move Here.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When logged in as administrator, all icons on the Terminal Server console can be
	moved on the desktop by dragging the icon using the left mouse button. If you
	drag most shortcut icons with the right mouse button, you get an option menu
	that includes Move Here. Most icons are movable. However, the Outlook shortcut
	and the Install IIS shortcut will not move with the right mouse button and the
	Move Here option. You can drag them around the screen, but they always return to
	their starting position.
	
	This same behavior is noticed on Windows NT 4.0 SP3.
