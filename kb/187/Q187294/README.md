	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you run the Emergency Recovery Utility (ERU) wizard in Windows 95, you may
	use a formatted floppy disk even though the wizard prompts you to insert a
	formatted system disk.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you use a formatted floppy disk instead of a formatted system disk with the
	ERU wizard, you can not use this disk as a bootable disk. Other than this disk
	not being bootable, it is the same as if you use a system disk.
