	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Although you can set the length of quarters to anywhere from one to twelve
	minutes, Microsoft NBA Inside Drive 2000 calculates statistics in a simulated
	game as if each quarter were 12 minutes in length.
	
	This method of calculation can lead to inaccuracies in the post-game statistics.
	For example, if you play a simulated game with five-minute quarters, post-game
	statistics may show that certain players played for longer than 20 minutes.
