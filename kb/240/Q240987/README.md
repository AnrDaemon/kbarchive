	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Pandora's Box, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Pandora's Box, the colors on the screen may briefly
	become distorted when you start or quit the game, or when you switch to or from
	different programs.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if an older video adapter is installed in your computer,
	and the Microsoft Windows color palette setting is set to 256 colors.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, increase the Windows color palette setting. To do this:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Display.
	
	3. Click the Settings tab.
	
	4. In the Colors or Color Palette box, click High Color (16 bit), True Color (24
	  bit), or True Color (32 bit), and then click OK.
	
	  NOTE: If none of these settings is available, your video adapter does not
	  support higher color palette settings.
	
	5. If you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.
	
	If the issue continues to occur, contact the manufacturer of your video adapter
	to inquire about how to obtain and install the latest version of the video
	driver for your video adapter, or consider purchasing a new, DirectX-compatible
	video adapter.
