	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article explains the server size limits for an MSN e-mail account.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	10 megabytes (MB) of data can be stored on the MSN e-mail servers at any given
	time for an individual MSN e-mail account. This does not, however, include data
	that has been downloaded. Once an e-mail is downloaded, it is no longer stored
	on the server and therefore clears up space on the server.
