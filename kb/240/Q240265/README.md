	================
	
	CD-ROM: Copy Readme.txt File To Hard Drive
	------------------------------------------
	
	The sample code applications for this book are complex, and the instructions for
	using the code vary from chapter to chapter. There are specific notes in the
	Readme.txt file that will assist you in running the sample code from your hard
	drive. It is recommended that you copy the Readme.txt file to your hard drive so
	that you can easily refer to it when needed.
	
	
	Chapter 8: Solution For This Chapter Does Not Work
	--------------------------------------------------
	
	Symptoms:
	
	When you first open the Chapter 8 solution on the CD, it appears to work
	correctly. You can create and edit a timesheet. When you submit a timesheet,
	everything seems to be working fine. However, when you try to retrieve the
	submitted timesheet, the program fails. The timesheet was not actually saved.
	The spreadsheet area of the web page may appear white instead of with its usual
	formatting. If you quit and reopen the page, the spreadsheet area once again
	appears white.
	
	Resolution:
	
	Replace the ..\Chap08\Timesheet.asp file with this revised version.

	Chapter 10 Files Updated To Accommodate Change In Microsoft Investor

	The files in chapter 10 may not work correctly due to a change in the Microsoft
	Investor web site. The self-extracting archive file mentioned above includes a
	fix for this problem.
	
	Chapter 12 Files Missing From CD-ROM
	------------------------------------
	
	The Chapter 12 files were missing from the CD-ROM included with the first
	printing of "Programming Microsoft Office 2000 Web Components." The
	self-extracting archive file mentioned above includes those missing files.
