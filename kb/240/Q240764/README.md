	Page 48: Delete Step 5 Of Procedure
	-----------------------------------
	
	On page 48, in the section titled "Link Two Documents Using Paste Special",
	delete Step 5: "On the Standard toolbar, click Cut."
	
	
	Page 49: Steps Out Of Order
	---------------------------
	
	On page 49, in the section titled "Finish the lesson", clicking the Save button
	does not ask you if you want to save changes. The note about the 'Save Changes'
	message boxes should appear below Step 3.
	
	Change:
	
	1. On the standard toolbar, click the Save button.
	  To save your changes to Book Fair 02 and Logo Practice 02, click Yes when
	  the message boxes ask if you want to save changes.
	
	2. On the File menu, click Close.
	
	3. On the File menu, click Exit.
	
	To:
	
	1. On the standard toolbar, click the Save button.
	
	2. On the File menu, click Close.
	
	3. On the File menu, click Exit.
	  To save your changes to Book Fair 02 and Logo Practice 02, click Yes when
	  the message boxes ask if you want to save changes.
	
	
	Page 84: Error In Image
	-----------------------
	
	The illustration on page 84 is not consistent with the text. Step 3 above the
	illustration says to set the left margin to 1.25", but the illustration shows
	the margin set at 1.26". This results in a 5.96" area rather than the 6.0".
	
	The image should be changed to reflect the 1.26"-6.0"-1.25" ratio that the text
	describes.
	
	
	Page 128: Change "Column" To "Row"
	----------------------------------
	
	At the bottom of page 128, in the section titled "Add a row", correct step 2 as
	follows.
	
	Change:
	"The new column appears above row 5."
	
	To:
	"The new row appears above row 5."
	
	
	Page 144: Image Is Incorrect
	----------------------------
	
	The image on page 144 will not match your computer screen, as it shows the
	Lesson01 files in the search results. The Lesson01 files do not contain the
	"Invoice" keyword, so they should not appear in the image.
	
	
	Page 231: Missing Workgroup Only Icon For "Retracting an email message" Section
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The "Retracting an email message" exercise on page 231 applies only to the
	Workgoup/Corporate installation of Outlook 2000. As a result, the Workgroup Only
	icon should appear by this exercise. The email recall feature is not available
	in the Internet Only installation of Outlook 2000.
	
	
	CD-ROM: Audio Is Very Low
	-------------------------
	
	The audio in the movie files contained on the companion CD-ROM is very low. This
	is true of the FrontPage, Internet Explorer, and Publisher movie files.
	
	Microsoft is aware of this problem and will apply appropriate corrections in
	future editions.
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
