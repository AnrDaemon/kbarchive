## Q240652: Profile Quotas May Cause Terminal Server Session to Hang

{% raw %}

	Article: Q240652
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Implementing profile quotas may cause Terminal Server sessions to stop
	responding (hang). This behavior occurs when the terminal connection is set to
	run a program instead of running the default desktop.
	
	In this case, when you quit the specified program, the Terminal Server session
	does not terminate. An administrator must kill the hung session on the server
	before the user can use his or her account again.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Profile quota implementation is not supported in the initial program
	environment. A fix has been generated to disable profile quotas if the
	connection is set to run a program instead of the default desktop.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
	phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

	NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
	be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
	update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
