## Q236128: Deleting the Last User Privilege Deletes the Group Object

	Article: Q236128
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix
	Last Modified: 20-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use programs to modify user rights and permissions to delete a
	privilege, the group is deleted even if it still has rights to the computer. For
	example, if you use Security Manager (Secedit.exe) and delete the Users group
	from the "Shut down the Machine" privilege, the group would no longer be listed,
	even if it had system rights such as "Log on Locally."
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the Local Security Authority Server Trusted Client
	Library deleted the group when the last privilege was removed even though there
	were rights still associated with the group.
