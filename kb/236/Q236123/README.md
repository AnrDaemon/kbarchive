	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	LUs that are added to pools by means of the SNA Manager may not be dynamically
	picked up by clients if the SNA Server configuration file is very large. The
	following error message is displayed when a client attempts to open a session:
	
	  No LU in LU Group Free.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The problem is caused when the dynamic updates time out while they are waiting
	for a response. This problem can occur when you save a very large SNA Server
	configuration file (such as Com.cfg) as it will generate a large number of
	dynamic status updates. This problem occurred on a customer configuration that
	had 56,000 objects and a Com.cfg file size of 7 MB.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
	4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Restarting the SNA Service resolves the problem.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
	3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2. This problem was
	first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.
