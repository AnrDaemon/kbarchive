## Q236944: Write Protect Error Occurs After Program Is Run from Floppy Disk

	Article: Q236944
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix
	Last Modified: 20-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run a program from a write-protected floppy disk and then quit the
	program, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  System - Write Protect Error
	
	  The disk cannot be written to because it is write protected.
	  Please remove the write protection from the volume in drive A:.
	
	If the floppy disk is not write-protected, the error message does not occur.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When a program is run from a floppy disk, Windows handles the program file like
	a modified page. After the program is quit, the modified page should be removed
	without file input/output (I/O). The problem occurs because Windows attempts to
	write the page to the floppy disk like a modified data page.
