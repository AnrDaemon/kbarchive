## Q236330: Event Not Reset in ScsiClassGetInquiryData in SCSI Class Driver

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using some third-party SCSI filter drivers, you may receive error
	messages that refer to either the SCSI class drivers or the third-party filter
	driver. The exact stop code will vary, with "STOP 0xA" and "STOP 0x1E" being the
	most common.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Windows NT SCSI Class driver does not properly handle a notification event
	when sending SCSI_IOCTL_GET_INQUIRY_DATA, so an underlying filter driver that
	handles the request asynchronously may cause an error message on a blue screen
	(STOP screen).
	
	This happens because the event being used to signal that the asynchronous request
	has been fulfilled is not reset properly on a retry of the request, causing the
	next I/O packet to be set before the request is finished.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
