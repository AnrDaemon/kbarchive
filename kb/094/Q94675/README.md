	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When printing to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M, horizontal and vertical
	lines (black or white) may appear throughout the image if the printer has low
	memory. This problem occurs when W1 Image Adapt (LOSSY) compression mode is
	engaged with an application that performs its own banding (such as Microsoft
	Paintbrush).
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use any of the following three methods to avoid this problem.
	
	- Try printing the file at a lower resolution. Selecting a lower resolution
	  requires less printer memory.
	
	- Make the image smaller.
	
	- Add more memory to the printer.
