	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you scan a Flight Simulator version 3.0 or 4.0 disk with the Norton
	Anti-Virus version 2.1, you are notified that the MtE virus is infecting the
	following files:
	
	  EGA1.GRA
	  EGB1.GRA
	  MONO.GRA
	
	The files are not infected, but they apparently match the pattern of the virus
	scanned for by Norton Anti-Virus.
