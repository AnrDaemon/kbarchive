	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M
	(HPPCL5E.DRV) version 1.03 or 1.04 and Adobe Type Manager (ATM) versions earlier
	than 2.5, text formatted for ATM fonts may not be aligned correctly. The text
	may not print in the font for which it was formatted and gray bands may also
	appear behind the text.
	
	This problem has been reported to Hewlett-Packard for all version of ATM earlier
	than 2.5. Upgrading to ATM 2.5 seems to correct the problem.
