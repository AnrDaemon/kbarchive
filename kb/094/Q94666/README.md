	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Data General machines may have difficulty accepting input from the F5 and F8
	keys, which are used to bypass or step through the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
	files.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You must press the F5 or F8 key immediately after hearing the first beep from
	your computer BIOS at system startup. You may have to press the F5 or F8 key
	many times.
	
	(On most computers, you have a few seconds to press the F5 or F8 key after you
	see the "Starting MS-DOS..." prompt and hear the beep.)
