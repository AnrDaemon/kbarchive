	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When setting the options in the Options dialog box of the Hewlett-Packard
	LaserJet 4/4m driver, HPPCL5E, the option to create line art halftones is not
	available when the resolution is set to 600DPI.
	
	Line art halftone processing is designed as a compromise to optimize some black
	and white bitmaps when printing at 300DPI. The setting is not needed at 600DPI.
	
	If the line art halftone processing was set under 300DPI and then the driver is
	switched to 600DPI, the halftone creation will be automatically changed to
	Photographic halftone processing.
