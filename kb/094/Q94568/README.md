	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows detects the FORMS virus, the following
	generic message is displayed:
	
	  The virus infecting this disk has not been analyzed by Central Point
	  Software. As a result, the virus cannot be removed. See your "MS-DOS 6 User's
	  Guide" for information about updating Microsoft Anti-Virus so you can detect
	  and remove the latest viruses.
	
	Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows cannot clean the FORMS virus but the
	MS-DOS-based version of Microsoft Anti-Virus (MSAV.EXE) can.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you do not have the MS-DOS-based version of Microsoft Anti-Virus installed,
	run SETUP /E to install the optional utilities. For more information on SETUP
	/E, see page 4 of the "MS-DOS 6 User's Guide."
