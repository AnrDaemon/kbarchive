	When running Broderbund's Vegas Games with Microsoft Windows 3.1, you may
	receive the following error messages when exiting certain games:
	
	  <application name> destroy cursor fails
	
	  Application error: Application requested abnormal termination
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	According to Broderbund technical support, this error is caused by the advanced
	functions used for the mouse pointer. Choosing the OK button when closing should
	not harm any of the other running applications. The games that generate the
	error message are Poker, Blackjack, and Keno. The other games included with the
	package usually close without any problems.
