	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you print in either mode of Windows using the Okidata 24-pin driver
	(OKI24.DRV), you may have problems printing from an MS-DOS command prompt or
	from MS-DOS-based application in Windows.
	
	These problems include:
	
	- All MS-DOS printing is triple-spaced on an Okidata ML 393 after printing in
	  Windows
	
	- All MS-DOS printing has extremely small line feeds, and an entire page prints
	  in only a few lines on an Okidata ML 393 Plus after printing in Windows.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The problems occur with the OKI24.DRV version 1.0 dated 3/10/92 that ships with
	Windows 3.1. The Windows driver does not appear to be properly resetting the
	printer after use.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
