	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M
	(HPPCL5E.DRV) and the TrueType Screen Fonts Installed check box located in the
	driver's setup dialog box is selected, the driver will not enumerate the
	internal Intellifont fonts for an application's font list.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This option is provided in the driver so that if equivalent TrueType fonts are
	installed, the fonts do not show up twice in the font list. If the equivalent
	TrueType fonts are not installed and the TrueType Screen Fonts check box is
	selected, no Intellifont fonts will be displayed in the font list.
