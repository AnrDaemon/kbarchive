	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When running LaserTools PCPanel version 2.2, it may not be possible to print to
	a file with Windows 3.0.
	
	PCPanel (Printer Control Panel) does not prompt you for an input filename.
	Instead, the Now Printing dialog box will appear, and the printer will not print
	or it may eject a blank page.
	
	This is a confirmed problem with version 2.2 of PCPanel. This problem has been
	corrected in PCPanel version 2.3.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	PCPanel is a memory-resident application that looks for PCL and PostScript
	output, and directs it to the appropriate device.
	
	PCPanel is currently being shipped by three original equipment manufacturers. It
	comes with all NEC printers, Okidata 830 and 840 printers, and the Adobe
	PostScript cartridge. Each has its own respective version, which is at present
	2.3x (where "x" is an N for NEC, O for Okidata, or an A for Adobe).
	
	If you are experiencing the above problem, call your respective manufacturer for
	an upgrade to version 2.3.
	
	PCPanel is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
	implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
