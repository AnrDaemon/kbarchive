	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows informs you that older
	entries have exceeded the "archival period," it is a reminder to archive
	old information in the Schedule+ calendar file when the calendar contains
	information that is six months old (the default). You should keep your
	calendar file as small as possible by keeping current information in the
	calendar file and archiving the older information.
	
	You can change the 6-month default to anywhere from 1 to 99 months by
	starting the Schedule+ Administrator program and following this procedure:
	
	1. From the Administration menu, choose Schedule Storage.
	
	2. Type the number of months (1 to 99) you want to pass before Schedule+ reminds
	  you to archive the information in your calendar.
	
	3. Press the ENTER key.
	
	To archive old information, create an archive file by choosing Create
	Archive from the File menu of Schedule+. To view the information in an
	archive file, choose Open Archive from the File menu. Once the archive file
	is open, it behaves as if it were another calendar file.
