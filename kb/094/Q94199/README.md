	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When running Andrew Tobias' TaxCut for Windows (tax year 1992) under Windows
	versions earlier than version 3.1, you may receive the following error:
	
	  Cannot find COMMDLG.DLL.
	  Verify that the path is correct or insert in drive A:
	
	Andrew Tobias' TaxCut is a trademark of Meca Ventures, Inc. The package is
	updated each tax year. The currently released version is for tax year 1992 and
	is called Headstart TaxCut for Windows. This version, as all other tax-year
	versions, will have a final update shipped to the user before April 14th of the
	following year (1993).
	
	Trying to launch the program from within Windows 3.0 displays the following error
	message:
	
	  Cannot find COMMDLG.DLL.
	  Verify that the path is correct or insert in drive A:
	
	Neither solution works because this file is a Windows 3.1 file and does not exist
	in earlier versions of Windows. The program will not display a message
	indicating that it requires Windows 3.1 or later to run.
	
	The only solution to this problem is to upgrade to Windows 3.1 or change to
	TaxCut for MS-DOS.
