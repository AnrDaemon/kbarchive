## Q94767: WFWG: Schedule+ May Not Print Entire Appointment Field

{% raw %}

	Article: Q94767
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0,3.1,3.11

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print with version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ or Windows for Workgroups
	Schedule+, the text in the appointment fields may be truncated. There is no
	method to customize the printout so that all information is displayed.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only way to work around this limitation is to export the data to a text file
	and then import it to another application, such as Notepad or another word
	processor, to be printed.
	
	Schedule+ prints approximately 29 characters of the appointment field when
	printing the Pocket size page, 96 characters when printing the Junior size, and
	116 characters when printing the Standard size. Schedule+ indicates that there
	is more information by adding ellipsis (...) to the end of the line.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a limitation of Windows for Workgroups
	Schedule+ included with versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this problem
	and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
