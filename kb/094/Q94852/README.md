	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you reach level 5 in Pipe Dream, the playing field has blocks or areas that
	are raised above the playing field to show that you cannot use them. On an EGA
	system these raised areas of the blocks are not visible. This can make it very
	difficult to play levels beyond level 5.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Pipe Dream in the Windows
	Entertainment Pack Volume 2.
