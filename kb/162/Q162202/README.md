	- Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to use one of the Encarta Online Features, you get the
	following error message:
	
	  Web Browser Setup
	
	  Encarta Encyclopedia cannot connect to the World Wide Web.
	
	- If you've connected to the web from this computer before, click Browse and
	  locate your Web browser.
	- If you've never connected to the Web before, click Help for more information.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Encarta cannot start your Web browser. There are several reasons why this
	occurs:
	
	- You do not have an Internet account and a working Web browser. The Online
	  features in Encarta require that you have a working Internet Web connection.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Your Web browser is an internal component of another program. There are some
	  Web browsers that are not separate programs, but rather components of other
	  software. Encarta will not be able to open these "internal" browsers. An
	  example of this browser is AOL for Windows, which is included with America
	  Online.
	
	  -or-
	
	- You are using a Windows 3.1 or 16 bit Web browser. You need to tell Encarta
	  where this program is by clicking on the Browse button.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Your Web browser is not installed correctly. If you are using Internet
	  Explorer for Windows 95, or Netscape Navigator for Windows 95, install the
	  browser again to make sure that it is properly registered in Windows.
