	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to print one page of a multiple-page document from WordPad to a
	PostScript printer, a blank page may be printed instead of the page you
	expected. This problem occurs only if you attempt to print a page other than the
	first page of a multiple-page document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Windows 95 PostScript printer driver (Pscript.drv) does not properly print
	individual pages of a multiple-page document from WordPad.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, print more than one page of the document.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
