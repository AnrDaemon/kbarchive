	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You are unable to control the swing of a player and after the swing dialog box
	appears with the following message:
	
	  Player will swing in # seconds.
	
	where # is the number of seconds.
	
	This occurs when you are playing a game with one or more computer players. When a
	computer player is at the tee, the words "Recorded Player" will appear below the
	swing control.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To remove a computer player from the game, wait until a non-computer player's
	turn, exit the game and start a new one.
	
	If only computer players are selected to play this game, you can exit the game
	and select different players by doing the following:
	
	1. When the dialog box appears with the message "Player will swing in #
	  seconds", click Pause.
	
	2. From the Game menu, click Welcome Screen.
	
	3. Click Yes to exit the current game.
	
	4. Click New Game.
	
	5. Remove the unwanted computer players from the Selected players list and add
	  non-computer players.
	
	NOTE: Computer players can only be seen if the Show Players setting is set to
	Yes. All computer players have a camera to the left of the name and all
	non-computer players have a golf ball to the left of the name.
	
	If there are only computer players available, click the Create button to create a
	new player.
