## Q162176: Thumbnail Image Doesn't Appear on Expected Gallery Page

	Article: Q162176
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
	Version(s): 3.0; WINDOWS:97

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Clip Gallery for Windows 95, version 3.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
	- Microsoft Publisher 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you add clips to the Clip Gallery, by choosing Import Clips on the Clip
	Gallery window, you can't control which page (tab) the thumbnail appears on. For
	example, if you are currently viewing the Clip Art page and you insert a clip
	for a graphic with an .bmp extension, the thumbnail appears on the Pictures
	page.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. Clip Gallery uses the term "clip art" to refer to any
	vector-based graphic and places thumbnails for these files on the Clip Art page.
	Clip Gallery uses the term "picture" to refer to any raster-based graphics and
	places those thumbnails in the Picture page.
