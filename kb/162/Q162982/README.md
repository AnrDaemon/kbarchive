	SYMPTOMS

	but the document on the screen will not be refreshed.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	After you save the document, close and then reopen the file. When the document
	is reloaded, the updated version will be displayed.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word version 97.
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you save a document as HTML, Word will save the document as HTML, close the
	open document, and then reopen the HTML version of the document. This is done
	because HTML does not support many of the formatting options available in Word.
	By closing and reopening the HTML document, Word can accurately update the
	displayed document to provide an accurate representation of the HTML document.
	
	With the default file type set to HTML Document, clicking the Save button on the
	Standard toolbar or clicking Save on the File menu will automatically save the
	current document as HTML. However, saving as HTML in this manner will not
	refresh the current document.
	
	A problem may arise when the current document has formatting that is not
	supported by HTML. If the document is not refreshed, the open document not
	reflect what the HTML document will look like.
