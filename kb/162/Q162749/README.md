	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following article tells how to activate single-click online access from
	16-bit Windows 3.1 programs such as Encarta 97 with America Online.
	
	To enable single-click Online access from Windows 3.1, do the following:
	
	1. If you are using an older version of AOL, upgrade to "AOL 3.0 for Windows."
	  This is available from America Online.
	
	2. Install a standalone Web browser, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape
	  Navigator.
	
	3. Start the AOL software, and let it dial and connect.
	
	4. After connecting, minimize AOL.
	
	  NOTE: Do not exit from AOL. You must leave AOL running to provide the Internet
	  connection.
	
	5. Start your Windows 3.1 program. All online features should now work
	  automatically using the standalone Web browser.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	AOL's software provides the Internet connection using a proprietary Windows
	16-bit "Winsock" interface. This is compatible with other 16-bit programs that
	use Internet access, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 for Windows 3.1.
	
	NOTE: You need to start AOL 3.0 for Windows manually to provide the Internet
	connection. Let AOL dial and connect to the Internet before using online
	features of other Internet-enabled programs.
	
	Browser Dialing Settings
	------------------------
	
	You do not need to configure your standalone browser to dial AOL's access phone
	number. As long as AOL is running, the browser will have an Internet connection
	to work with.
	
	Proxy Settings
	--------------
	
	If you used Internet Explorer with a proxy server previous to installing AOL 3.0
	for Windows, you need to disable the proxy settings. Contact your network
	administrator for details.
