	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The computer screen becomes distorted if you try to manipulate the Open Database
	Connectivity (ODBC) manager on a computer running S3 video with Windows NT 4.0,
	Microsoft Office 97, and Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) installed. Applying
	Service Pack 1 or 2 does not solve this issue. The only way to restore the
	computer screen when it becomes distorted is to restart your computer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
