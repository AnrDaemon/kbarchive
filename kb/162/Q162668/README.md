	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the Windows\Options and Windows\Options\Cabs folders in
	OEM releases of Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If Windows 95 was preinstalled on your computer, there may be Windows\Options
	and Windows\Options\Cabs folders on the hard disk. The files in these folders
	serve the following purposes:
	
	- If you did not receive a Windows 95 CD-ROM with your computer, these files
	  are used by the Create System Disks program to create a floppy- disk backup
	  of the Windows 95 installation disks, should you need to reinstall Windows 95
	  in the future.
	
	- When you add or remove a Windows 95 component using the Add/Remove Programs
	  tool in Control Panel, Windows 95 Setup uses these files to complete the
	  process instead of prompting you to insert your Windows 95 floppy disks or
	  CD-ROM.
	
	If you have not created your floppy-disk backup of Windows 95, do not delete
	these files until you have done so.
	
	If you already have a floppy-disk backup of Windows 95 (or if you received
	Windows 95 on a CD-ROM), these files are provided as a convenience to you. If
	you delete the files, you need to have your Windows 95 floppy-disk backup or
	CD-ROM available whenever you change your Windows 95 system configuration.
