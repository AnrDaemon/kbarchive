	merge main document if the data source is saved on a Banyan network.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When a mail merge data source is created and saved to a Banyan network drive,
	the file appears to be saved correctly. After the file is saved, the mail merge
	feature will not prompt you to edit the data source and the data source will not
	be attached to the mail merge main document.
	
	The data source was saved to the Banyan network drive and you are able to open
	the file as a regular document in Word. However, you can't attach the file as a
	data source and no error message is presented.
