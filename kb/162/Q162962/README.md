	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the new features of the Microsoft Office 97 Developer
	Edition Tools (ODE Tools) compared to its predecessor, Microsoft Access
	Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0 (ADT 7.0).
	
	For a list of features included with Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit,
	version 7.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	ODE Tools offer the following new features compared with ADT 7.0:
	
	Setup Wizard
	------------
	
	- A new Tips button on the initial screen of the Setup Wizard helps you avoid
	  common problems and mistakes creating setup images with the Wizard.
	
	- The ODE Tools Setup Wizard supports the use of dependency files (.dep), which
	  makes it easier to redistribute ActiveX controls by automatically including
	  required ActiveX support files with your application.
	
	New ActiveX Controls
	--------------------
	
	- The Animation control allows you to create buttons on your forms that display
	  animation (.avi files).
	
	- The Winsock control provides access to Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) and
	  User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to allow you to stream data between two
	  computers using TCP/IP protocol.
	
	- The Internet Transfer control provides access to HTTP and FTP Internet
	  protocols so you can connect to World Wide Web servers to retrieve HTML
	  documents and upload or download files on FTP servers.
	
	NOTE: The Data Outline control is not included with Microsoft Office 97 Developer
	Edition Tools; however, an updated control for Microsoft Access 97 is available
	free from the Microsoft Download Center. For information about obtaining the
	updated Data Outline control, please see the following article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base:

	  Center
	
	Replication Manager
	-------------------
	
	- The ODE Tools Replication Manager allows synchronization via the Internet or
	  an intranet.
	
	- You can use Synchronizers (formerly Transporters) to synchronize replicated
	  databases directly if both replicas to be synchronized can be opened at the
	  same time. Using a Synchronizer to manage a network dropbox folder for
	  indirect synchronization is still an option.
	
	- Improved user interface allows you to view any replicated database in the
	  Synchronization window. You can also see the status and history of replicas
	  managed by other Synchronizers or replicas that are not managed by any
	  Synchronizer.
	
	Source Code Control
	-------------------
	
	- ODE Tools supports the use of version control (also known as source code
	  control) software, such as Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version 5.0. Version
	  control software gives developers the ability to track and maintain changes
	  within their source code, and is often used on projects where multiple
	  programmers work on source code simultaneously.
	
	Other New Features
	------------------
	
	- The Microsoft ODE Tools Sampler contains technical information and code
	  samples from the Microsoft Developer Network.
	
	- The Replication Manager White Paper discusses how to create and manage
	  replicated databases.
	
	- The Source Code Control White Paper provides an overview of the source code
	  control component of ODE Tools.
	
	- Improved Help Workshop for creating custom Help files for your application.
	
	- Microsoft Office 97 Visual Basic Programmer's Guide and Building Applications
	  with Microsoft Access 97 user manuals.
