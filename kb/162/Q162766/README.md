## Q162766: WINS Records Are Timestamped Incorrectly

	Article: Q162766
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:3.51,4.0
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If a WINS extinct (also called tombstone) record is replicated, the record's
	Expiration Date is set incorrectly on the replication pull partner.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	WINS is making no distinction between active and tombstone replicas and is
	adding verify interval (which could be up to 576 hours) to the current time for
	tombstones, instead of Extinction Timeout.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
	to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
	destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
	implementing this fix at this time.
	
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
	problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
	version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
	following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
