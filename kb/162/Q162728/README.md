	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using the Systems Management Server Administrator program to open a chat
	session with a Systems Management Server client, the client can chat with the
	system that initiates the session. However, when the server attempts to chat
	back, the text typed is not visible to the client.
	
	This is an intermittent problem that does not occur on every remote chat session.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
	Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
