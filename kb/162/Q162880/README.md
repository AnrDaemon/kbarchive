	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you run the Edbutil utility with the /d and /r switches to repair a corrupted
	EDB file, the following error message may be generated by the Edbutil.exe
	application:
	
	  -1305 Jet_errObjectNotFound
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This error message may be generated if you run the Edbutil utility with the /d
	and /r options. During the repair process one or more data tables is discarded
	due to corruption. To verify that this is the case, check the application event
	log for the following event ID:
	
	  Event ID: 44
	  Source: EDB
	  Type: Warning
	
	  Description: The database engine lost one table called <datatablename>
	
	This error message means that the Edbutil utility discarded this particular table
	during the repair process. If this table is one of the required tables, such as
	the Deleted Messages, Mailbox, or Folder Tombstone tables, the store may not
	start and the "-1305 Jet_errObjectNotFound" error message may be generated.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Because "-1305 Jet_errObjectNotFound" is an unrecoverable error message, you
	must restore from a valid backup to recover.
