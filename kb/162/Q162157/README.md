	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows NT does not return the correct character set (charset) information for
	the Cyberbit unicode font. For example, an application attempts to map to one of
	the multiple character sets of this font, such as Greek, but Windows NT is
	unable to find that character set.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
	problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
	version 4.0 For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
	following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
