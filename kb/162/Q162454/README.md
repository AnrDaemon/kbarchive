	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Dial-Up Networking, the Operator Assisted and Manual Dial options may be
	disabled.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The modem type is set to Standard Modem.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The Standard Modem setting is for modems that do not have specific drivers. The
	capabilities of a modem using the Standard Modem setting are limited.
	
	To modify the driver your modem is using, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.
	
	2. Check the list of installed modems for a modem labeled "Standard Modem."
	
	3. If Standard Modem is the only entry in the list, click Add, click Do Not
	  Detect My Modem, and then click the modem's manufacturer in the Manufacturers
	  box.
	
	4. If the manufacturer is not listed, or the correct model does not appear when
	  the manufacturer is selected, contact the manufacturer of the modem for
	  information about a driver for the modem.
