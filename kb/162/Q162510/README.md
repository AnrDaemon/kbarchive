	At the beginning of the installation of the patch, you will receive the
	following warning message:
	
	  This patched version of Monster Truck Madness is not Multiplayer compatible
	  with the retail version of Monster Truck Madness. To play multiplayer once
	  you've installed the patch, your opponents have to install the patch too. Do
	  you wish to continue?
	
	The installation of the patch will make your version of Monster Truck Madness
	(MTM) unplayable in a multiplayer mode with a retail version of MTM not using
	the patch. You are warned at the time of download, at the time of installation,
	and in the patched version of the Readme.txt in the Monster Truck Madness patch
	section.
	
	This patched and non-patched version incompatibility will not generate an error
	message, you will simply not be able to see each other in any form of
	multiplayer game. The solution is to either remove the patched version of
	Monster Truck Madness and reinstall the program from the compact disc, or have
	your opponent install the patch.
