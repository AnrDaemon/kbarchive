	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you have an Internet account and a Web browser, the programs listed at the
	top of this article can automatically open Web sites using your existing
	Windows-compatible web browser. These Microsoft programs cannot open America
	Online's "AOL for Windows 3.0" Web browser.
	
	The AOL Web browser included with "AOL for Windows 3.0" is not a standalone,
	separate Web browser. This AOL browser is an internal component inside the main
	AOL program. There is no way for the Microsoft programs to open the AOL browser.
