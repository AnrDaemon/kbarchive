	Article: Q302920

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may see an incorrect maximum mailbox size in MSN Explorer for a free
	(non-MSN Internet Access) account. You sign in to MSN Explorer, click the E-mail
	icon, click the Show Folders button, and then click the Organize folders link at
	the bottom of the list of folders. The mailbox size limit appears under the
	"Size" column, next to Total size of the folders on MSN. The limit for a free
	account should be displayed as "max: 2000" in the lower right corner of the
	screen. However, some users may see "max: 10000". "10000" is the limit for a
	paid MSN Internet Access account. Even though the limit is displayed
	incorrectly, you will receive a warning message if your mailbox size exceeds
	2000 KB.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known issue.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Only paid MSN Internet Access subscriber accounts have a limit of 10000 KB. All
	free accounts have a size limit of 2000 KB, regardless of the limit number that
	may appear in MSN Explorer.
