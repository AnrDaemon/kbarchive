	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After changing the age setting on the account to 13 years or younger, you cannot
	sign into MSN Companion.
	
	CAUSE

	By changing to age to the age of a minor (under the age of 13), MSN Companion
	recognizes the user as a Kid Passport account, and the MSN Companion does not
	utilize Kids Passport.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue
	
	- Access your MSN account through a PC and correct the setting there. If you do
	  not have access to a pc, please contact Customer Service.
	
	Note: The MSN Companion product team is working to incorporate Kids Passport on
	MSN Companion.
