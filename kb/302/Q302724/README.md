	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You sign in to MSN Explorer 6.1 on a computer equipped with Windows XP, and you
	use the account manager's user tile (the user tile associated with an MSN
	Internet Access account). You quickly switch to a guest sign in, without signing
	out (the dial-up connection is still active). You try to sign in to MSN Explorer
	while logged in as a guest. An error message appears stating that the "modem is
	not working properly or is already in use".
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known issue.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	- When using MSN Explorer with Window XP, you may use any MSN Explorer user
	  tile, but you cannot sign in as a guest.
	
	This issue will be resolved in a later release of MSN Explorer.
