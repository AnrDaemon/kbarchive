	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You run ZoomText (the screen magnification program) version 7.06. You start MSN
	Explorer 6.1, and then proceed through Setup. On the Do you want MSN Internet
	Access screen, you choose "No, I already have Internet Access". A dialog box
	appears indicating that there was a problem with MSN Explorer, and that MSN
	Explorer must be restarted.
	
	CAUSE

	This is a known issue with ZoomText software.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Turn off Active Accessibility option within the ZoomText software. This option
	can be safely turned back on once the initial account setup has been completed
	in MSN Explorer.
	To turn off the Active Accessibility option in ZoomText
	
	1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then point to ZoomText.
	
	2. Click Profiler.
	  The profiler window appears.
	
	3. Clear the Active Accessibility box, and then click the OK button.
	  You can now safely complete the setup of MSN Explorer. After the MSN Explorer
	  account has been successfully set up in, you can follow the steps above to
	  run the Profiler and select Active Accessibility box, if you wish to
	  re-enable this feature.
