	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You install MSN Explorer (version 6.1) on a computer that also has Internet
	Explorer 5.0 and one of the following programs installed: Microsoft Office,
	Microsoft Word, or Microsoft Works. You right-click the butterfly icon in the
	system tray (the area next to the clock on your computer), and then click System
	Information.
	
	Note: You can also reach this screen by signing in to MSN Explorer, clicking More
	Choices, clicking About MSN Explorer, and then clicking Configuration.
	
	E-mail spellcheck is listed as installed and available, even though this feature
	is not available to use.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Internet Explorer 5.5 is not installed on the computer. The spellcheck option is
	not available because it requires Microsoft Office, Microsoft Word, or Microsoft
	Works and Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher. This is a known issue.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you want spellcheck in MSN Explorer, upgrade to the latest version of
	Internet Explorer at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie.
