	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MSN Explorer may stop responding when you click the Forward button while reading
	an e-mail message in MSN Explorer, select a portion of the text in the message,
	and then press the DELETE key on the keyboard. This is a known issue.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You will be able to resolve this issue by downloading and installing either
	Internet Explorer 5.5 (SP2) or Internet Explorer 6.0 (when these versions are
	available). To check on the availability of Internet Explorer releases, go to
	http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie.
	
	In the meantime, you can also forward the entire message without deleting any of
	the text.
	
	In addition, if you must forward the message with portions of the message
	deleted, you can go to http://www.hotmail.com and forward the message from the
	Hotmail Web site. This will allow you to delete text from the message without
	experiencing the issues described above.
