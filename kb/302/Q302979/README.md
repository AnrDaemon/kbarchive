	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You install MSN Explorer 6.1, specify that you have an existing MSN Internet
	Access account, and then select MSN dial-up as the connection device. You enter
	a Hotmail.com account (the account has been previously upgraded to a paying MSN
	Internet Access account). You proceed through Setup until you reach the
	Additional Information page (this page follows the page that displays access
	phone numbers). You click the Back button, and you are taken back to the Enter
	Account Information page. You click the Continue button, and you are taken to
	the Additional Information page. The page displaying the access numbers was
	skipped.

	This is a known issue.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To view the access numbers that are set up for your account
	
	1. Complete Setup and then, after MSN Explorer signs you in, click the Sign Out
	  button.
	
	2. On the sign-in screen, click Connection Settings.
	
	3. Select Changing dialing options, and then click Continue.
	
	4. On the dialing options screen, click Continue.
	  The list of access numbers will be displayed.
	  Note: If you need to find access numbers for another area, follow the steps
	  above, but select Change the location you're dialing from instead of Changing
	  dialing options in step 3.
