## Q302789: When You Sort Address Book Entries By A Criteria Other than &quot;Nic

	Article: Q302789
	Product(s): The Microsoft Network
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 30-JUL-2001
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You sign in to MSN Explorer and click the E-mail icon in the top toolbar. You
	click the Address Book tab, and then you sort the entries in the address book by
	another criteria (for example, by e-mail address) by clicking on the heading for
	a particular column. You sign out of MSN Explorer and sign back in. You start
	the Address Book as described above. The entries in the Address Book are once
	again sorted by nickname.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known issue.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	By default, MSN Explorer sorts the address book entries by the Nickname. If you
	wish to view the entries sorted by another field, click the heading for that
	particular column (clicking once will sort in ascending order and place an
	upwards arrow by the field, and clicking again will sort in descending order and
	place a downwards arrow by the field). You must do this procedure each time you
	sign in.
