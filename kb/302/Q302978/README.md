	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When signing in to MSN Explorer with an MSN Internet Access account, the access
	number is dialed, and MSN Explorer returns a message stating "Authenticating".
	MSN Explorer disconnects, and then the next access number is dialed. This
	process continues until all access numbers have been dialed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The dial-up credentials for the account have been written incorrectly.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The dialing credentials for the account must be cleared and rewritten.
	
	To clear and rewrite dialing credentials
	
	1. Start MSN Explorer.
	
	2. When the sign-in screen appears, press the Ctrl+Shift+F12.
	  The Manage dialing credentials window appears.
	
	3. Select Clear all dialing credentials, and then click OK.
	
	4. In the upper-right corner of the sign-in screen, click Connection Settings.
	
	5. Click Change how you connect to the Internet, and then click Continue.
	
	6. Select MSN Dial-up Internet Access, and then click Continue.
	
	7. Select the appropriate dialing options, and then click Continue.
	  MSN Explorer will now dial a 1-800 number. After you are connected, a window
	  appears stating "Please select the account you want to upgrade to use MSN
	  Internet Access". In the center of the screen is a section labeled This is
	  the e-mail account you will be upgrading. Your primary MSN Internet Access
	  account should be listed here.
	
	8. Type your password in the box, and then click Continue.
	
	9. Type your area code and telephone number in the boxes, and then click
	  Continue.
	
	10. Select the Area Code or Dial 1 box for each number (depending on the
	  requirements of your local phone service), and then click Continue.
	  MSN Explorer will now dial the first local access number chosen and sign you
	  in.
