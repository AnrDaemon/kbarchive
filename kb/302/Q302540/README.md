	================
	
	You must first purchase a "Universal Serial Bus (USB) to Ethernet adaptor" that
	is compatible with the MSN Companion. (For a list of compatible devices see KB
	Article Q.)
	
	The MSN Companion can be added to a network several ways:
	
	- As a stand alone device to a high-speed modem.
	
	- As part of a Home Network using Home PNA or Ethernet Network.
	
	To incorporate MSN Companion into a network, simply add the approved USB to

	2.0.
	MSN Companion will auto-detect the presence of the network and should begin
	functioning accordingly.
