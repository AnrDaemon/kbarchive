	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you execute a "Failsafe" procedure, you will upgrade to MSN Companion
	Version 2.0.
	
	Here are a few things to check after you've used Failsafe:
	
	- Make sure you are using Failsafe as the last resort (if you can connect to
	  the Internet, there is no need use Failsafe).
	
	- Make sure that the "Username" box contains correct information. For example,
	  it should read "WEBC/user". If this information is incorrect, then you will
	  not be able to Failsafe.
	
	- Remove the password that automatically appears, and type your password
	  manually. If you do not know your correct password, you cannot connect to the
	  Failsafe server.
	
	- Make sure that the "s" is removed from the "https://" portion of the URL.
