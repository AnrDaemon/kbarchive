	Article: Q302441
	Product(s): The Microsoft Network
	Version(s): 6.1
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network version 6.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You sign in to MSN Explorer version 6.1. When a new e-mail message arrives, a
	box appears just above the system tray (by the clock on your computer). You
	click the link inside this box to open the new message. The message opens in a
	new window, but the window that is already open is larger, and so the window for
	the new message is hidden.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known issue. This issue will be resolved with the release of Internet
	Explorer 6.0.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Do one of the following:
	
	- Click the box (this box should appear as a butterfly followed by the title of
	  the message) in the taskbar.
	
	- Minimize the main MSN Explorer window.
