## Q302935: XADM: Truncated Text Returned If CDO Runs as a Service

	Article: Q302935
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 5.5,5.5 SP1,5.5 SP2,5.5 SP3,5.5 SP4
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbExchange550preSP5fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) application as a Microsoft
	Windows NT service, if a message body contains double-byte character set (DBCS)
	characters, the Exchange Server information store may return a truncated message
	body.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When the CDO application runs as a Windows NT service, CDO uses Unicode text to
	get the message body. Because the message body is stored as American National
	Standards Institute (ANSI) text, the Exchange Server information store converts
	the ANSI text to Unicode text. This problem can occur during the conversation if
	a DBCS character spans the 16 kilobyte (KB) boundary.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
	phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

	NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
	be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
	update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.

	later:
