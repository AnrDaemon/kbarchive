	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you read an e-mail message in MSN Explorer, Hyper-Text Markup Language
	(HTML) code is visible. The HTML is the code that is the basis for Web pages; it
	generally appears as code and text enclosed by brackets.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue is caused by an error in the e-mail program used to send the message.
	The message gets sent as a plain text message, but in fact, the message contains
	HTML code. MSN Explorer reads the message as plain text, and displays the entire
	message--including the HTML code.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To view the message correctly
	
	- Go to http://www.hotmail.com and sign in with the account name and password
	  you use in MSN Explorer.
	  Note: If you are using MSN Explorer to visit the Hotmail web site, signing in
	  will not be necessary).
