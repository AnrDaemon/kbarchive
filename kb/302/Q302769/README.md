## Q302769: Cannot Add Or Edit Address Book Entries In Offline Mode With MSN

	Article: Q302769
	Product(s): The Microsoft Network
	Version(s): 6.1
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 25-JUN-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network version 6.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Using MSN Explorer 6.1, you sign in by selecting the Read mail offline box.
	After you are signed in, you click the Address Book tab. The Add New Contact box
	is not active ("grayed out"); you cannot select it. Also, if you select a
	contact to view the information stored for that contact, you cannot update the
	contact's information.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. The Address Book in MSN Explorer is stored MSN central
	computers or "servers". This arrangement allows you to access the Address Book
	from any computer that has an Internet connection--instead of only on one
	computer. However, this also means that you must be connected to the Internet to
	update the Address Book. Because the files are stored on a central computer or
	server, you must be online so changes you make can be recorded on the server.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Go online to add or update entries in your Address Book.
	
	To go online from offline mode
	
	- Do one of the following:
	
	- In the My Stuff bar on the left side, click the Go Online button.
	
	- Click one of the inactive ("grayed out") options on the screen (such as the
	  Home button), and then click Go online.
	
	- Click Sign Out, and then sign in from the Welcome screen without selecting
	  the Read Mail Offline box.
