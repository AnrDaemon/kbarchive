	Notes about Adobe Acrobat Reader
	--------------------------------
	
	Text pasted from Adobe Acrobat Reader retains its character level formatting (for
	example, fonts, bold, italic, underline, color, and so on). However, some
	reformatting of the text after you paste it into Microsoft Word is probably
	necessary.
	
	If security has been set in a PDF file, you may be unable to select and copy the
	contents of the PDF document for use in Word.
