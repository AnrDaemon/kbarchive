## Q145902: XCLN: Pressing ESC Key Does Not Close Profiles Dialog

{% raw %}

	Article: Q145902
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 4.0 5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbother

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open the Microsoft Exchange Profile dialog box, you cannot close it by
	pressing the ESC key. You must close the dialog box by selecting the Close
	button, or by using the control box in the upper-right corner of the dialog box
	window.
	
	NOTE: The ESC key does work successfully in other sections of the Mail and Fax
	applet.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Because this window is not a child window of an application, this behavior is by
	design.
	
	Additional query words: escape cancel
