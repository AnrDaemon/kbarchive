	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to print an Overview, only the Copy option is available. The
	Print option is not available (dimmed).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, capture the screen image into the Clipboard and
	paste the graphic image into a word processing application such as WordPad.
	
	To capture the image, do the following:
	
	1. Make sure the Overview window is open.
	
	2. Press and hold down the ALT keyboard key while you press the PRINT SCRN
	  keyboard key. This copies the screen image to your Windows Clipboard.
	
	3. Paste the image into your word processing program. For more information about
	  how to accomplish this task, see the instructions for your word processing
	  program.
	
	  NOTE: The word processing application must be capable of accepting a graphic
	  image.
