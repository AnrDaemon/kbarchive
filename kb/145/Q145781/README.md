	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When a user creates a MacBinary FreeDoc file without an extension and drags the
	file to the Inbox of a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows, the system will
	display the file with a generic icon. Only after the user associates the file
	with the proper icon will the file be displayed with the proper icon.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is by product design. A MacBinary file with an extension displays the
	correct icon in the viewer. When creating the FreeDoc, detect that the file is
	MacBinary and convert it to PC format so that it can automatically use the
	correct icon.
