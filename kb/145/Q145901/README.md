	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click Copy Audio from the sound Media menu in Encarta Encyclopedia, you
	can't paste the audio into other applications.
	
	When you attempt to Paste the audio into another document or application, the
	Paste menu item is not available (grayed-out).
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The following steps describe how to create a sound resource file you can paste
	(insert) into an application.
	
	1. On the Encarta sound Media menu, click Copy Audio.
	
	2. On the Apple menu, click Control Panels.
	
	3. Open the Sound control panel.
	
	4. On the Edit menu, click Paste.
	
	5. Type a name for the sound you are pasting into the Sound control panel. Click
	  OK. The sound should appear in the list of sounds available.
	
	6. Open the System Folder.
	
	7. Open the System suitcase.
	
	8. Find the sound file you just named and drag it to the Desktop.
	
	The sound file may be successfully inserted into a document or application.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Many applications with the ability to insert a sound file stored on disk, do not
	have the ability to directly paste a sound file stored in the Clipboard into a
	document.
	
	The workaround allows you to convert the sound, as it exists in the Clipboard,
	into an actual sound file that can be manipulated and inserted into many
	different applications.
