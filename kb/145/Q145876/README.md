## Q145876: Setup Does Not Warning When Install Over Previous Installation

	Article: Q145876
	Product(s): Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:7.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 18-DEC-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Schedule+ over a previous installation, such as with Microsoft
	Office 95, the Setup program will not give you a warning if it is installing
	over the previous installation. If the directory that contains the previous
	installation is selected, the new version of Schedule+ will replace the old one.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. The data files from the previous version will be left intact,
	and the program will be upgraded to the version being installed.
