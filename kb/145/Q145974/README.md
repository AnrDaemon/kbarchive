	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Exchange 4.0 clients to connect to Microsoft Exchange
	Server via RAS/DUN, users may complain that the cancel button does not seem to
	operate correctly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The cancel button is very slow to respond due to the architecture of the
	Microsoft Exchange client. Normal download speed was preserved at the expense of
	the speed of this function.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
	clients. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
