	========
	
	When you assign the accelerate function in Microsoft Motocross Madness or

	SideWinder game controllers listed at the beginning of this article, the
	throttle control does not respond.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====

	assign functions to game controller buttons.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, assign the acceleration function to a button on your
	game controller.
	
	STATUS
	======

	listed at the beginning of this article.
