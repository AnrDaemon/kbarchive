	The Crimson Skies Update version 1.01 fixes the following issue:
	
	When you play a multiplayer game or when you customize a plane in Instant Action,
	single player saved games may be inadvertently reset to the first mission.
	
	After the saved games are reset, you cannot recover the lost mission state. You
	must replay the campaign from the first mission.
