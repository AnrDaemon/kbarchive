	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you apply Dynamic HTML effects (DHTML) to different cells in a table and
	then view the table in a Web browser, the DHTML effects may not occur as
	expected.
	
	For example, let's say you apply DHTML effects to the first two cells of a table
	to change the border color of the cell to a different color when the mouse
	pointer passes over the cell. When you view the page in a Web browser, you see
	only the DHTML effects applied to the first cell.
	
	NOTE: Some DHTML effects may not be supported by your Web browser. For more
	information about compatibility with other browsers, click Microsoft FrontPage
	Help on the Help menu, type "compatibility" (without the quotation marks) in the
	Office Assistant or the Answer Wizard, and then click Search to view the topic.

	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem and have the DHTML effects work when the mouse
	pointer passes over the cells, add text to the cells that contain the DHTML
	effects. The DHTML effects will occur when the mouse passes over the text of the
	cells when viewing the table in your Web browser.
