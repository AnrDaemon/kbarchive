	Replace all text on page (below heading but both above and below Figure 23-6)

	Another way to position a picture (or text) is to turn it into a watermark, which
	places it behind the normal text on the page and displays it in a lighter shade
	so that text or other objects show over it easily.
	
	To create a watermark, insert a picture or text when working in header and footer
	view, as follows:
	
	1. Choose Header and Footer from the View menu to display the Header and Footer
	  toolbar.
	
	2. Click the Show/Hide Document Text button on the Header and Footer toolbar to
	  hide any text or graphics in the main part of the document, if necessary. For
	  more information, see "Using Headers and Footers" on page 320.
	
	3. Insert the graphic or a text box using the Drawing toolbar. See Chapter 19
	  for more information.
	
	4. Position and format the graphic or text box so it appears where you want it
	  on the page. You're not limited to the header or footer areas - you can place
	  the object anywhere on the page.
	
	5. Click the Close button on the Header and Footer toolbar to return to the
	  standard document view. The picture or text you inserted will appear in a
	  lighter shade, and you'll find that you can insert text or graphics on top of
	  it.
