	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Universal Disk Format (UDF) file system is not supported in any release of
	Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	UDF is a file system defined by the Optical Storage Technology Association
	(OSTA) for DVD. UDF is compliant with ISO-13346 and is the successor to the
	CD-ROM file system (CDFS or ISO-9660). All DVD-based devices should be able to
	read a DVD-ROM disc, including:
	
	- Double-sided, double-layered discs, which will hold up to 17 gigabytes (GB)
	  of data.
	
	- DVD-WO (also known as DVD-R), a variation of DVD-ROM that supports one-time
	  recording capabilities, similar to CD-R.
	
	- DVD-RAM, a variation of DVD-ROM that supports multiple recording
	  capabilities, similar in function to magneto optical discs.
	
	DVD-Video (also known as DVD-Movie) is a disc that contains digital, highly
	compressed, multimedia data in the Video Object (VOB) format as specified in the
	DVD Specifications, version 1.0. This medium is used to distribute feature films
	that can be played back by either a DVD-Video player or a computer with an
	installed DVD-ROM drive. These disks require a third-party program for playback
	on a Windows 95-based computer.
