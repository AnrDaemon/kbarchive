	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you repeatedly change the private properties of the Server Message Block
	(SMB) share resource (ones that are exposed with "cluster res fileshare /priv"),
	heap corruption may occur. This may also cause an access violation error message
	to be displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This corruption occurs because the address passed to ResUtilFreeParamaterBlock
	is invalid, and this address is eventually passed to LocalFree, causing the
	access violation.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
	additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft

	first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.
