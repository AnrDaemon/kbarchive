	Page 57: Callout Pointing To Wrong Buttons
	------------------------------------------
	
	In the graphic under the "Drawing" entry, the callout text is reversed. The 3rd
	callout should point to the Draw button, and the 1st callout should point to the
	drop-down arrow. Please reverse the 1st and 3rd callouts.
	
	
	Page 62: Two Incorrect Features On Page
	---------------------------------------
	
	Two of the features under the Erasing Cells entry are incorrect.
	
	In the Erasing a Cell's Contents section,
	
	Change: "...choose Contents Del or press Delete."
	To: "...choose Contents or press Delete."
	
	Delete the entire Erasing Hyperlinks section as it is no longer correct.
	
	
	Page 76: Button Name Incorrect
	------------------------------
	
	In the procedure at the end of the Full Screen entry, a button name is incorrect.
	In the last sentence,
	
	Change: "...click the Close Full Screen toolbar button."
	
	To: "...click the Full Screen toolbar button."
	
	
	Page 102: Delete Information That Is No Longer Correct
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	In the Office Assistant, the last sentence before the graphic, beginning "Or
	click Tips, and the Assistant..." is no longer correct. Please delete it.
	
	
	Page 170: Command On Insert Menu Incorrect
	------------------------------------------
	
	Two changes need to be made to the end of the Insert Menu entry.
	
	First, the Object command is actually on the Insert Menu (not on a submenu), so
	it should be a the same level as they Hyperlink command. Please left-align it
	with Hyperlink and format it in the same way.
	
	Second, the Map command is no longer on the Insert menu. Please delete it.
