	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Multicast packets with a time-to-live (TTL) field of zero are sent from
	Microsoft Windows NT-based hosts on the network. Although these packets should
	be received by interested processes running on the sending host, the packets
	should not be sent out on the network.
	
	This behavior may cause problems with multimedia tools that use packets with a
	TTL of zero for testing purposes, or as an inter-process communication mechanism
	for autodiscovery of components in a multimedia conferencing bus.
