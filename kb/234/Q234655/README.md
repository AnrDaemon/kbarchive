## Q234655: Err Msg: Unable to Log You on Because the Netlogon Service...

	Article: Q234655
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix
	Last Modified: 16-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you restart your computer, the Netlogon service may not start and the
	following error message is displayed when you attempt to log on at the server
	console:
	
	  Unable to log you on because the Netlogon service is not running.
	
	The server may start successfully after multiple restarts.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) for the domain
	does not initialize if the locale for the computer is set to use a code page
	that uses Unicode double compression. Locales that are known to support this
	feature are Danish and Hungarian. The way string comparisons are handled for
	double compression code pages causes the problem.
