	================
	
	Page x: Misspelling Of Straightforward
	--------------------------------------
	
	In second paragraph, 3rd line down, fix spelling of straightforward. It is
	currently spelled "staightforward."
	
	
	Page 15: Toolbar Names On Menu Have Changed
	-------------------------------------------
	
	The lower screen shot should be replaced to reflect final version of software.
	The 3-D Settings and Shadow Settings toolbars should not appear on this menu.
	
	
	Page 88:  Misspelling of "Excel"
	--------------------------------
	
	Change spelling from "Excels" to Excel in line 7 of left text column.
	
	
	Page 126: Misspelling of "miniature"
	------------------------------------
	
	In line 8 of left text column, change spelling from "minature" to miniature
	
	
	Pages 150, 154: Button Name Changed
	-----------------------------------
	
	On pages 150 and 154, need to replace the lower screen shots to reflect new name
	of button. The button now reads "Press and hold..." instead of "Click and
	hold..."
	
	In addition, need to change step 5 on both pages to read:
	If you want, click the Press And Hold To View Sample button to preview your chart
	as you build it.
