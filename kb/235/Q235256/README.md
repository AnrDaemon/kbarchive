	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Page 24: Try This Is Inaccurate
	-------------------------------
	
	The "Try This" note should read:
	
	"...display the first few lines of messages in the Inbox,..."
	
	
	Page 25: Delete The Tip On This Page
	------------------------------------
	
	Remove the first Tip on the page. There is no Mail Delivery tab.
	
	
	Page 51: Button Labeled Incorrectly
	-----------------------------------
	
	In the tip, the Send/Receive button is named incorrectly. The Tip should read:
	
	"...choose Send/Receive from the Tools menu..."
	
	
	Page 84: Procedure On This Page Is Incorrect
	--------------------------------------------
	
	Please change the procedure on this page to read as follows:
	Step 1 should read:
	
	"Choose Go To from the View menu and News from the submenu. This opens Outlook
	Express."
	
	Step 2 should be:
	
	"Select Outlook Express from the Folders list if it isn't already selected."
	
	Change the current step 2 to step 3.
	
	
	Page 89: Procedure And Screen Are Incorrect
	-------------------------------------------
	
	Step 2 should read:
	
	"Click Synchronize Account"
	
	
	Page 90: Callout Line Points To Incorrect Section Of Screen
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	The callout line for the callout on the far right of page 90 doesn't point to
	anything. It should turn 90 degrees to the left and point to the part of the
	Message window that lists sender, newsgroup, and date information.
	
	
	Page 91: Procedure And 2nd Graphic On Page Are Incorrect
	--------------------------------------------------------
	
	For picture attachments (as shown in the book and as most newsgroup message
	attachments are), step 2 should read:
	
	"?and choose Save Picture As from the shortcut menu."
	
	
	Page 92: Button And Callout Names Inconsistent
	----------------------------------------------
	
	The callout on this page refers to the Attach File toolbar button, and although
	the ScreenTip for this button says Attach File, the actual button is just called
	Attach.
	
	Change: "...click the Attach File toolbar button."
	
	To: "...click the Attach button."
	
	
	Page 193: Step 1 Is Incorrect
	-----------------------------
	
	Step 1 should read:
	
	"Click the Start button, choose Programs, choose Accessories, choose
	Communications (if available), and then click Internet Connection Wizard."
