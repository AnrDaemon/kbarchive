	Page 14: Reference To Incorrect Filling Type
	--------------------------------------------
	
	On page 14, in the second paragraph, change the reference so that it corresponds
	with the last paragraph on the page.
	
	Change:
	"...Sweet Lil's has altered that recipe, changing the Candlelight Ecstasy filling
	from raspberry to marzipan."
	
	To:
	"...Sweet Lil's has altered that recipe, changing the Candlelight Ecstasy filling
	from mocha cream to marzipan."
	
	
	Page 82: Steps Are Incorrect
	----------------------------
	
	On page 82 the steps in the "Set field properties" exercise are incorrect. The
	steps should be as follows:
	
	Change:
	"Verify that the Carriers table is displayed in Datasheet view."
	
	To:
	"Verify that the Carriers table is displayed in Design view."
	
	Step 2 should be removed, and the remaining steps should remain unchanged.
	
	
	Page 124: Procedure Is Incorrect
	--------------------------------
	
	Please make the following changes to this procedure:
	
	Delete all of step 5.
	
	Renumber step 6 to step 5, and delete the result text:
	"The Link dialog box replaces the Select Index Files dialog box."
	
	Renumber step 7 to step 6.
	
	
	Page 225: Callout Line Points To Wrong Part Of Graphic
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Detail section top callout line should stop right above the name "Alpine
	Collection."
	
	
	Page 234: Confusing Typo in Step 3
	----------------------------------
	
	The first step 3 at the top of the page has a confusing error. It should say:
	"...click the New Object: AutoForm drop-down arrow..."
	
	
	Page 236: Wrong Button Pictured in Quick Reference
	--------------------------------------------------
	
	The wrong button is pictured with the "Create an "instant" AutoReport using the
	Standard format" how to. Use the New Object: AutoReport button instead.
	
	
	Page 275: "Boxes" Should Be "Bonbons"
	-------------------------------------
	
	There are multiple errors in the steps on page 275.
	
	In step3, change:
	"select Table: Boxes."
	
	To:
	"select Table: Bonbons."
	
	In step 3, change:
	"list except BoxesID"
	
	To:
	"list except BonbonsID"
	
	In step 5, change:
	"with Boxes already"
	
	To:
	"with Bonbons already"
