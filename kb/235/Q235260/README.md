	Page 17: Step 3 Is Incorrect
	----------------------------
	
	The result in step 3 is incorrect. The text should read:
	
	"This is called an AutoFill pointer."
	
	
	Page 17: Step 5 Is Missing
	--------------------------
	
	Step 5 on page 17 is missing entirely. Step 5 should read:
	
	"Drag the AutoFill handle down to cell A9."
	
	
	Page 32: Wrong Image Displayed
	------------------------------
	
	The image on the bottom of the page should be almost identical to the one
	displayed on page 33. The current image depicts a spreadsheet from a few
	chapters ahead.
	
	
	Page 34: Typographical Error
	----------------------------
	
	On page 34, step 2 change:
	"A5 though G5"
	
	To:
	"A5 through G5"
	
	
	Page 52: Error In Sidebar
	-------------------------
	
	The sidebar on page 52 states that F5 or Ctrl+F will open the Find File dialog.
	This is incorrect.
	
	F5 will open the Go To dialog.
	Ctrl+F will open the Find dialog.
	
	To open the Find File dialog, you must select Open from the File menu, then click
	the Tools button and select Find.
	
	
	Pages 59 & 60: Incorrect Instructions
	-------------------------------------
	
	The steps are incorrect and should read as follows:
	
	1. Make sure cell E26 is selected.
	
	2. No change.
	
	3. No change.
	
	4. Press Enter.
	
	5. Double-click the border between columns E and F.
	  Column E widens to fit $141.05.
	
	Your screen should look similar to the following illustration in the book.
	
	
	Page 73: 4/25/00 Should Be 4/25/2000
	------------------------------------
	
	On page 73,
	
	Change:
	"The date is properly formatted as 4/25/00."
	
	To:
	"The date is properly formatted as 4/25/2000."
	
	
	Page 124: Callout Points To The Wrong Part Of The Graphic
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	In the graphic on page 124, the Summary Row callout line should point to row 38,
	not row 35.
	
	
	Page 175: Steps Are Misnumbered
	-------------------------------
	
	On page 175, step 8, change:
	"Step 3 of 4"
	
	To:
	"Step 4 of 4"
	
	
	Page 399: Procedure Contains Incorrect Information
	--------------------------------------------------
	
	In the text describing the first procedure on this page, there is incorrect
	information. The screen settings for this book were "800 x 600" not "640 x
	480."
