	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When GroupWise users receive a contact as part of an e-mail message from an
	Exchange Server user, the resulting contact information is converted to a Rich
	Text Format (RTF) attachment with only the following information:
	
	  From
	  To
	  Cc
	  Subject
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because of a limitation in messaging features between
	Microsoft Exchange Server and Novell GroupWise server. The GroupWise system does
	not support contacts as an attachment type.
