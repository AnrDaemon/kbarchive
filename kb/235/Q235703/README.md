	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you migrate a folder with a long folder name from NetWare to a Windows NT
	domain, the permissions for the folder and any files or subfolders it contains
	may not be migrated correctly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is caused by the Nwconv.exe tool. This tool is not capable of
	enumerating rights for files or folders with long file names.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
	that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
	guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
	incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
	
	For this fix to work, you must add a REG_DWORD value named DisableAltFileName
	with a data value of 0 to the following registry key:
	
	  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NwRdr\Parameters
	
	Adding this value and setting it to 0 enables alternate file name support, which
	is necessary for this fix to work correctly.
