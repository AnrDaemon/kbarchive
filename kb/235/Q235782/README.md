	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When an application adds REG_MULTI_SZ values to the registry that has been
	repackaged with the Systems Management Server Installer, the executable that is
	generated by Systems Management Server Installer fails to recreate these
	registry entries correctly. This can cause errors when attempting to use the
	repackaged application at a later time. REG_MULTI_SZ values are normally
	terminated by two consecutive nulls. Systems Management Server Installer fails
	to insert the second null which normally indicates the end of a REG_MULTI_SZ
	value.
	
	For more information on the various value types in the registry see the following
	article:
	
	  Q101230 Definition of Registry Value Data Types.
	
	STATUS
	------
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server and
	Systems Management Installer version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the
	latest U.S. service pack for Systems Management Server and Systems Management
	Installer version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
