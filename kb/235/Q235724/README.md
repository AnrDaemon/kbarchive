	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Systems Management Server 2.0 Installer included with Systems Management
	Server Service Pack 1, includes functionality for complex expressions and
	operators.
	
	Using complex expressions and operators, you can create variables for your
	installation script that you could not otherwise create. You can also use
	complex expressions to assign an integer or a string value to a variable. You
	can use complex operators when you are using the Set Variable script item to
	assign a Boolean value to a variable. You use complex operators to present a
	conditional statement for assigning a variable.
	
	If the condition of the statement is met, then a Boolean value of 1 is assigned
	to the variable. If the condition of the statement is not met, then a Boolean
	value of zero is assigned to the variable.

	This functionality is included in versions of Systems Management Server Installer
