	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Solar System for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following are the minimum system requirements to successfully run
	Scholastic's The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System:
	
	- Computer: Intel 486 or higher or other 100-percent compatible PC systems
	  Minimum 25 MHz CPU (33 MHz and higher recommended).
	
	- Memory (RAM): Minimum of 4 megabytes (MB) RAM. If the system has less than 10
	  MB of physical RAM, you will need to create a swap file of 6 MB or greater.
	  The swap file can be either permanent or temporary.
	
	  If your swap file is too small or you don't have enough RAM, you may get the
	  following error when you try to run Magic School Bus:
	
	  Insufficient memory to run application! Quit one or more applications, or
	  free up disk space, to increase available memory (see README.TXT). Then try
	  again.
	
	- Hard Disk Space: 5 MB free disk space (more free disk space is required if
	  the system has less than 10 MB of physical RAM, see above).
	
	- CD-ROM Drive: Double-speed CD-ROM: The CD-ROM drive should transfer data from
	  the CD-ROM at 300K per second while using less than 40 percent of the CPU
	  bandwidth, and have an average seek time of less than 400 milliseconds.
	
	  MS-DOS CD-ROM Extension (MSCDEX) version 2.2 or later. Check the documentation
	  for your CD-ROM drive.
	
	  NOTE: Explores the Solar System may run on computers with an MPC Level I
	  "single-speed" CD-ROM drive; however, a double-speed CD-ROM drive is
	  recommended for consistent performance on a wide range of systems.
	
	- Video: SVGA 640 x 480 X 256 colors (local bus/accelerated video recommended)
	  Explores the Solar System requires a minimum of 256 colors.
	
	- Operating System Requirements: MS-DOS 5.0 or later Microsoft Windows 3.1 or
	  later
	
	- Sound Requirements: Any MPC compatible sound card capable of playing .WAV
	  files, such as:
	
	   - Microsoft Windows Sound System
	   - Creative Labs Sound Blaster or compatible sound card
	   - Media Vision Pro Audio or compatible sound card
	
	- Other Requirements: Stereo sound amplification (speakers) or headphones, and
	  a mouse.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to the above system requirements, for the best performance, follow
	these recommendations:
	
	- Do not use Windows hot keys while running Explores the Solar System. (Hot
	  keys are shortcut keys that execute a command.)
	
	- For faster performance, verify that the system has a permanent swap file.
