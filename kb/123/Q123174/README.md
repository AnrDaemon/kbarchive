	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Windows 95 on a HardPC system, you cannot start Windows 95.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	HardPC is a hardware/software package designed to emulate MS-DOS on an
	Intergraph Clipper Workstation (a UNIX workstation based on the Clipper
	processor); it was designed to be compatible with Windows versions 3.x. This
	product is not compatible with Windows 95.
	
	NOTE: The HardPC product includes a card that has an Intel processor and allows
	Intel-based programs to run. It also contains VGA and SVGA drivers based on
	Windows 3.x. This package works with Windows 3.1 but is unsupported by
	Microsoft.
