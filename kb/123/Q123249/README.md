	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you run the ATI Mach32 setup utility (INSTALL.EXE), you may be unable to
	start the computer except in Safe Mode.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the Windows 3.x drivers supplied by ATI conflict
	with the Windows 95 drivers.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	ATI has updated versions of the drivers available on its BBS. The updated
	drivers work only if you have previously installed an ATI Windows 3.1 driver.
	For more information about the updated versions of the video drivers, contact
	ATI.
