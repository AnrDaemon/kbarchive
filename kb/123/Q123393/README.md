	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Write application to select and use the Type 1 font
	ZapfDingbats, a different font is displayed when you type. After you select the
	ZapfDingbats font in the Fonts dialog box, the correct font is displayed in the
	Samples window. However, after you choose the OK button, the text in the
	document is displayed with the closest screen font, such as Wingdings, instead
	of ZapfDinbats.
	
	The identical font installation is used for the ZapfDingbats font and other Type
	1 fonts, but the other Type 1 fonts act as expected using the correct font in
	both the sample window and the document
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
