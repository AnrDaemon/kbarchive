	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Movie lists created in Cinemania 1994 are not available in Cinemania 1995 or
	Cinemania 1996 unless you manually copy the appropriate *.LST file to the
	Cinemania 1995 or Cinemania 1996 directory.
	
	By default, Cinemania 1995 is installed in C:\CIN95, and Cinemania 1996 is
	installed in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Multimedia\Cinemania. As neither program
	upgrades over Cinemania 1994, the .LST files are not converted.
