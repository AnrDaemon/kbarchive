	Microsoft currently has client software available to allow Windows NT to
	become a client on a Novell NetWare network. NetWare Compatible Client
	(NCC) is currently available separately for Windows NT version 3.1 and is
	included in Windows NT version 3.5. It is available for Intel-based, MIPS-
	based, and ALPHA-based platforms.
	
	NCC allows Microsoft Windows NT workstations to access files, directories,
	and printers on Novell NetWare servers. In addition, when installed on
	Windows NT Advanced Server, NCC installs a file and print services gateway
	that allows Microsoft networking clients (computers running Windows NT,
	Windows for Workgroups, or LAN Manager version 2.x) to access files on
	NetWare servers without having NetWare client software loaded.
	
	NCC requires the NetWare Link (NWLINK) transport be installed and uses
	NWLINK to provide file and print services to NetWare servers. It also
	requires Windows NT version 3.1 with U.S. Service Pack 1 or later
	installed.
	
	NCC can be customized to specify such features as the preferred server and
	printing options through the CSNW (Client Services for NetWare) icon in
	Control Panel. When installed on Windows NT Advanced Server, the icon shows
	as GSNW (Gateway Services for NetWare) reflecting the additional
	functionality of the file and print services gateway.
