{% raw %}

	Article: Q123976
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 08-AUG-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Windows NT, sequential reads from a large file should be in blocks of 64K.
	Under certain circumstances, Windows NT incorrectly reads in 4K blocks (on the
	ALPHA platform it is 8K) and performance is reduced.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
	Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
	Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
	Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
