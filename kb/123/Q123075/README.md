## Q123075: Artist: Animated Backgrounds Don't Play In Pigture Show

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you place a picture with an animated background in your Pigture Show, the
	background is not animated during the Pigture Show. Animated stickers, however,
	are animated during the Pigture Show.
	
	STEPS TO REPRODUCE PROBLEM
	--------------------------
	
	1. Go to the Painting Studio.
	
	2. Click the Paint Bucket tool.
	
	3. Click the Wallpaper roll, and select one of the first 13 backgrounds, which
	  are animated.
	
	4. Click Mona Weasel (the Sticker Picker) and select one of the animated
	  stickers. The animated stickers are located on the sticker roll with a green
	  film style border.
	
	5. Save the file.
	
	6. Exit the Painting Studio.
	
	7. Run the Pigture Show wizard.
	
	8. Place this file in your Pigture Show.
	
	9. Click the Ready button, and then play the Pigture Show. The slide displays
	  with the selected background, and the animated sticker moves across the
	  slide, but the animated background remains stationary.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is by design. The first 13 backgrounds contain animation, which is a
	constant looping pattern. Because of the repeating design, animated backgrounds
	are not incorporated into the Pigture Show Play routine. Since the animated
	pictures play only once each time they are selected, they can be easily inserted
	into the play sequence.
