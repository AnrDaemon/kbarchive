	In the Server section of Control Panel, you can set alerts to be sent to
	specific users or computers when specific conditions are met, such as an Account
	Lockout due to too many bad password attempts.
	
	After you configure the Account Lockout feature (located on the Policies menu of
	User Manager), the alerts to the specific machines or users are not sent even
	though the condition has been met for an alert to be sent.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server version 3.5.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
