	The FoxPro Migration application helps developers convert dBASE IV and Clipper
	code to FoxPro compatible syntax. FoxPro 2.6 and 2.6a have built in commands
	providing compatibility with dBASE IV, so Microsoft no longer directly offers
	the Migration application to users. However, you can still obtain the files from
	the MSL.
