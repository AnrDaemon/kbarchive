## Q123874: PRB: Section Names Truncated to Eight Characters When Linked

	Article: Q123874
	Product(s): Microsoft C Compiler
	Version(s): 2.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 11-FEB-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Linker (LINK.EXE), included with:
	   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 2.0 
	   - Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You can control the section names that the C/C++ compiler, version 9.0,
	generates by using the /ND or /NT compiler options, the code_seg pragma, or the
	data_seg pragma. However, the names generated by the compiler are truncated to
	eight-character names during linking with LINK version 2.5.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design. Section names are limited to eight characters.

	================
	
	Steps to Reproduce Behavior
	---------------------------
	
	1. Build the following sample code
	
	  test.c
	     ------
	
	     #pragma code_seg( "LongCodeSectionName" )
	     int i=7;
	
	     main( )
	     {
	        exit(i);
	     }
	
	2. Observe the long section name contained in the object file by executing this
	  command:
	
	  link -dump -all test.obj > testobj.out
	
	  Then search the output file for LongCodeSectionName. The full name is in the
	  object file.
	
	3. Observe that LongCodeSectionName is truncated to LongCode in the executable
	  file by executing this command:
	
	  link -dump - all test.exe > testexe.out
	
	Additional query words: 2.50 9.00
