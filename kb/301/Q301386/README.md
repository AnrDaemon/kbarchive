	=======
	
	This step-by-step article describes how to install MetaEdit 2.2 on a computer
	that is running Windows NT version 4.0 or Windows 2000. MetaEdit 2.2 is designed
	to help you administer IIS by providing an easy way to edit the IIS Metabase.
	
	NOTE: Editing the IIS Metabase may result in damage to your IIS configuration. Be
	sure to edit all entries carefully.

	The following items describe the recommended hardware, software, network
	infrastructure, skills and knowledge, and service packs that you will need:
	
	- Internet Information Server 4.0
	- Internet Information Services version 5.0
	
	Step 1: Download MetaEdit 2.2
	-----------------------------
	
	The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
	
	  Mtaedt22.exe
	  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/iis50/Utility/5.0/NT45/EN-US/MtaEdt22.exe)
	
	The Mtaedt22.exe file is a downloadable, self-extracting file that contains the
	IIS MetaEdit 2.2 utility. After you download the MetaEdit 2.2 installation file
	to your hard drive, you're ready to install MetaEdit.
	
	Step 2: Install MetaEdit 2.2

	1. Double-click the Mtaedt22.exe file that you just downloaded.
	
	2. Click Yes to agree with the terms of the license agreement.
	
	  The installation process extracts the files that are contained in the
	  Mtaedt22.exe file, and then runs an extracted Setup.exe file to install
	  MetaEdit 2.2.
	
	3. When you see the dialog box that tells you to close all applications, make
	  sure that all applications are closed, and then click OK.
	
	4. When the main setup process begins, accept the default installation folder or
	  choose an alternate folder, and then click the large setup button to
	  continue.
	
	5. Click Continue to add the MetaEdit shortcut to the Administrative Tools
	  Program Group.
