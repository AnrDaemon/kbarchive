	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Ad Rotator in the bottom left hand corner of the screen does not link you to
	the correct site.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This happens when you access the Internet through a broadband connection. The Ad
	Server uses the IP address of the proxy server, so you see the last
	advertisement sent through the proxy server, which is usually different.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This issue only affects those users who access the Internet through a proxy
	server. This is a known issue and there is no resolution at the present time.
