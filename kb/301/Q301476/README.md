	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You have an MSN Companion device that has been upgraded to Version 2.0, and your
	attempts to connect via Broadband are unsuccessful.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve the issue
	
	1. Make sure that the USB to Ethernet Adaptor that you are using is one that is
	  supported. See
	
	  Q301477 Broadband-Supported USB-Ethernet Adaptors
	
	.
	
	2. Check the settings in the Connection Status box. Note that if "network
	  adaptor connected" is set to "No" then all of the items will be populated
	  with "No".
	
	  To resolve this issue, check your network adaptor and make sure that it is
	  connected properly to the USB Ports on the device.
	
	3. If "DHCP or Static IP detected" is set to "No", click the "my broadband
	  connection requires more specific settings" link. The "broadband settings"
	  page opens.
	
	  Note:
	
	   - If clicking the "Obtain an IP Address automatically (recommended)" link
	     fails to populate the boxes, contact your ISP directly for more
	     information.
	
	   - If you are using a home network, you should be able to determine what
	     needs to be provided in order to get the device to function properly.
	     Note: MSN Technical Support does not provide assistance in configuring
	     home networks for customers.
