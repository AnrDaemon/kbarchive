	If the specified screen saver is set to use password protection, but the screen
	saver does not exist on the computer, the computer is not locked when the screen
	saver time-out occurs. Users can still start programs.
	
	At this point, pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE does not display the Windows Security
	dialog box. Instead, the workstation is locked and displays the Unlock Windows
	dialog box.
