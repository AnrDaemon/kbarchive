	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the Application Converter component of the Microsoft Exchange
	Application Converter for Lotus Notes to create a connection between a Lotus
	Notes database and an Exchange Server folder, you cannot set the priority of the
	connection. The buttons on the Replication tab are unavailable.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is by design. Priority can be set through the Connection Manager component
	of the Application Converter for Lotus Notes.
