## Q243597: User Account Data Not Updated on Remote Shutdown

{% raw %}

	Article: Q243597
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you change a user account and then perform a remote shutdown, the changes may
	not be retained when the computer restarts.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Local Security Authority (LSA) process is not being notified of the system
	shutdown when the request comes from another computer. This causes the Security
	Accounts Manager (SAM) database not to be flushed.
