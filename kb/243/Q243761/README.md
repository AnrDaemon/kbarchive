	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you create a connection by using the Connection Manager that is included with
	the Application Converter for Lotus Notes (ACLN), you have the option to choose
	between personal folders and public folders. The folders in a user's mailbox on
	the server are not listed as an option.
	
	If you create a connection by using the Developer component of ACLN, you have the
	option to choose between personal folders, public folders, or folders in the
	mailbox on the server.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is by product design, because an administrator who uses the Connection
	Manager does not need to set up a connection between a Lotus Notes database and
	a user's private mailbox on the server. However, a developer who uses the
	Developer component may want to use the folders in his server mailbox while
	performing the conversion and creating Outlook forms.
