	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Application Converter for Lotus Notes (ACLN) is comprised
	of two components, the Application Converter for developers and the Connection
	Manager for administrators. This article explains the system requirements for
	the Exchange ACLN and also outlines some of its limitations.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The system requirements for an Application Converter computer (developer) are:
	
	- A Pentium personal computer with 16 megabytes (MB) of random access memory
	  (RAM).
	
	- Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5 or Windows 98.
	
	- 11 MB of disk space.
	
	- 32-bit Lotus Notes client release 4.x.
	
	- Outlook 2000 or Outlook 98.
	
	- Lotus Notes 3.x or 4.x databases.
	
	- Exchange Server personal folders, local information stores, or public
	  folders.
	
	The system requirements for a Connection Manager computer (administrator) are:
	
	- A Pentium or Alpha personal computer with 16 MB of RAM.
	
	- Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.
	
	- 9 MB of disk space.
	
	- 32-bit Lotus Notes client release 4.x.
	
	- Exchange Server version 5.5.
	
	- Lotus Notes 3.x or 4.x databases.

	required.
	
	The Exchange ACLN does not support Lotus Notes version 5. Application support for
	Lotus Notes 5 is currently being reviewed, and may be released in a future
	product update.
