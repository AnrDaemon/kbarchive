	----------------------------------------------------
	
	Pages 375, 376, 381 & 382, questions 70-059.05.03.004 and 70-059.05.03.007
	each contain an error in regards to the NBTSTAT switches. The NBTSTAT switches
	are case sensitive. The -r switch lists names resolved by broadcast and via
	WINS, while the -R switch purges and reloads the remote cache name table.
	
	Replace "-r" with "-R" in both the option and explanation for choice C.
