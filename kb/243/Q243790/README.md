	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you change the screen resolution on the Sound/Graphics screen while you are
	playing Microsoft Asheron's Call, the monitor screen may turn black or become
	distorted.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you click a screen resolution that your monitor does
	not support.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, start Asheron's Call in 800 x 600 mode and then
	change the screen resolution to a setting supported by your monitor. To do this,
	follow these steps:
	
	1. If necessary, exit from the game by pressing Alt+F4.
	
	2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Asheron's
	  Call, and then click Asheron's Call.
	
	3. Click Settings, and then click 3D Settings.
	
	4. Click to select the "Run in 800x600 Mode" check box, and then click OK.
	
	5. Click OK and then click Exit.
	
	6. Start Asheron's Call.
	
	7. On the Asheron's Call game screen, click Options.
	
	8. On the Sound/Graphics tab, in the Graphics drop-down list, select a
	  resolution supported by your monitor.
	
	9. When the "Test new screen size first, for 15 seconds?" question is displayed,
	  click Yes.
	
	10. When the "Accept this setting?" question is displayed, if the screen is
	  displaying properly, click Yes.
	
	11. If the screen is not displaying properly, click No or wait a few moments for
	  the previous resolution to automatically restore itself.
	
	12. If necessary, repeat steps 9 through 11 until a supported resolution is
	  found.
