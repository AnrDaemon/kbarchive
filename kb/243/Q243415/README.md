	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use programs on your computer running Windows NT with MO drives
	attached, your computer stops responding (hangs) when transferring a large

	CAUSE

	This problem occurs because when an error (bad sector) occurs, the object the
	file system driver was working on is not released for other uses.
