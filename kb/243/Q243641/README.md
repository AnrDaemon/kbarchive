	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If your inventory is full and you attempt to exchange an item in your inventory
	for an item belonging to a computer character in Asheron's Call, the computer
	character may take your inventory item, but you may be unable to accept the item
	from the computer character.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs, because the computer character still sees your inventory
	as being full.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, make sure there is sufficient room in your
	inventory before you attempt to exchange an inventory item with a computer
	character.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Asheron's Call version
	1.0 for Zone.com.
