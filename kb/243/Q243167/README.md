	Article: Q243167
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Tcmapp.exe does not properly handle situations in which a TAPI service provider
	(TSP) removes line devices. For example, a phone is removed, the old line device
	is removed, and a new one is added. In this case, Tcmapp.exe stops enumerating
	devices, so all devices after added after this device are ignored.
