	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use Microsoft Word as the e-mail editor in the Outlook client, you can
	select an option to "Wrap to window". If you select the "Wrap to window" option
	and clients other than Outlook open your message, the message wordwraps
	correctly when it is opened, rather than displaying paragraphs as one long line.
	In Outlook 97 or Outlook 98 this option is always selected as the default and
	you cannot clear it as a default setting. If you want to clear this option you
	must clear it manually in each new mail message.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can set this option when you compose a new message; in the new message, on
	the Tools menu, click Options, and then either click to select the "Wrap to
	window" check box or click to clear the "Wrap to window" check box, as
	applicable.
	
	
	The "Wrap to window" check box can be cleared as the default in Outlook 2000.
