	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When the PRINT SCREEN key is pressed, an interrupt occurs that dumps the
	contents of the screen to the printer. This interrupt (INT 05h) is not an MS-DOS
	interrupt; it is a ROM-BIOS interrupt.
	
	The MS-DOS MODE command can redirect the MS-DOS file handle and FCB output sent
	to the LPT1: device to a serial device (that is, COM1 or COM2).
	
	However, MS-DOS has no way to redirect the output generated by pressing the PRINT
	SCREEN key, which by default goes to the device referred to as LPT1:. The only
	way to redirect the output to another serial or parallel port is to use a
	public-domain utility designed for this purpose. Public- domain utilities are
	available that redirect printer output (including output generated by pressing
	the PRINT SCREEN key) to a file and to another parallel port.
