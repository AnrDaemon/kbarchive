	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00, the autopilot will change the
	direction of flight by about 40 degrees if you set autopilot to lock on the VOR
	to which you are currently navigating. As a result, the airplane will not be
	flying to the VOR, but in a direction about 40 degrees different from the VOR.
	
	You can work around the problem by doing the following:
	
	1. Select "F" for autopilot under the NAV/COM menu.
	
	2. Select Heading Lock and type in the degree value that shows on top of the OBI
	  indicator when the vertical cross hair is centered.
	
	3. The airplane will now fly in the direction of the VOR beacon.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator Versions 3.00
	and Version 4.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here as it becomes available.
