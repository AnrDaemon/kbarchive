## Q32811: FIX: Wrong Opcode For Far Call from USE16 Seg to USE32 Seg

	Article: Q32811
	Product(s): Microsoft Macro Assembler
	Version(s): 5.1
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 04-MAY-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	MASM will generate both an address-size and operand-size override for a far call
	from a USE16 segment to a USE32 segment. Only the operand-size override is
	necessary.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 5.10. This problem was
	corrected in MASM version 5.10a.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The address-size prefix is 67h and the operand-size prefix is 66h.
	
	The following sample code demonstrates the problem:
	
	Sample Code
	-----------
	
	  ;Assemble options needed: none
	
	     .386
	
	     s32 SEGMENT USE32
	     assume cs:@CurSeg
	        p   PROC
	        p   ENDP
	     s32    ENDS
	
	     s16 segment USE16
	     assume cs:@CurSeg
	            CALL   far ptr p
	     s16    ENDS
	
	            END
	
	  The opcode generated for the far call by MASM 5.1 is as follows
	
	     67| 66| 9A 00000000
	
	  The correct opcode (generated by MASM 5.10a) is as follows
	
	         66| 9A 00000000
