	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Starting with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 5.1, symbols that are
	language names cannot be declared PUBLIC. The language names affected are Basic,
	C, FORTRAN, and PASCAL. The following error message is displayed by MASM 5.1 and
	5.1a
	
	  error A2009: Symbol not defined:
	
	Note that it does not name the offending label.
	
	The following error is the generated by MASM 6.0
	
	  error A2008: Syntax error in directive
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The use of language names as variables is allowed in MASM versions 5.1 and 5.1a,
	but not is MASM 6.0. MASM 6.0 will give the error
	
	  error A2008: syntax error: <language name>
	
	where <language name> is Basic, C, FORTRAN, or PASCAL.
	
	The following example will cause MASM 5.1 and 5.1a to correctly generate error
	A2009 on the line
	
	     public c
	
	and MASM 6.0 to correctly generate error A2008 on the following lines
	
	     public c
	     c  DB  1
	
	Sample Code
	-----------
	
	  ; Assemble options needed: none
	
	  .model small
	  .data
	  public c
	
	  c  DB  1
	
	     END
