	Codes" in Table D.1 on Page 476 of the following manuals:
	
	1. "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.00: BASIC Language Reference"
	
	2. "Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 6.00 for MS-DOS and OS/2: BASIC
	   Language Reference"

	the conditions under which each error may occur.
	
	The following explanation for error code 2, "Syntax Error," is taken
	from Page 502:
	
	   "Several conditions can cause this error. The most common cause at
	    compile time is a mistyped BASIC keyword or argument. At run-time,
	    it is often caused by an improperly formatted DATA statement."
