	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you start Flight Simulator and go through each of the menus to select your
	graphics card, etc., your choices are stored in a file called AUTOEXEC.FS3 for
	Version 3.00 and AUTOEXEC.FS4 for Version 4.00.
	
	If you start Flight Simulator Version 3.00 by typing FS3, the program uses the
	AUTOEXEC.FS3 file to select the initial start-up options. If you start Flight
	Simulator Version 4.00 by typing FS4, the program uses the AUTOEXEC.FS4 file to
	select the initial start-up options. The initial start-up options stored in
	AUTOEXEC.FS3 or AUTOEXEC.FS4 also will be used if you start Flight Simulator by
	typing FS and selecting Option 2 for the "no-questions-asked startup."
