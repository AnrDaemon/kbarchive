	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article addresses problems found when using a particular IBM 4/16 MB Token
	Ring adapter and any version of Microsoft LAN Manager.
	
	This new IBM adapter can be identified by ROM part numbers 74F9325 (ODD) and
	74F9326 (EVEN). This adapter is also 25 percent smaller than previous IBM 4/16
	Token Ring NICs.
	
	When the adapter is used, it will freeze machines intermittently when accessing
	resources in the network. This problem occurs on all versions of LAN Manager.
	
	IBM Corporation is aware of the problem in their microcode and is distributing
	new ROMs to correct the above problem. Please contact your nearest IBM
	representative to obtain upgrade ROMs.
