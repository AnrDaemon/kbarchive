	=======
	
	Sanyo has confirmed that the Microsoft Learning MS-DOS tutorial program hangs on
	the Sanyo Laptop, model 16NB. This system has an 8088 processor and 640 x 200
	Supertwist LCD video. When attempting to load Learning MS-DOS on this computer,
	the copyright screen is displayed, the screen goes blank, and the computer is
	hung and must be rebooted.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Learning MS-DOS version 2.00. We
