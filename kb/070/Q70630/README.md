	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you change Windows screen colors from the Colors dialog box that is
	accessed from the Control Panel, you cannot apply dithered colors to certain
	screen elements of the desktop. This prevents you from selecting an unreadable
	color combination.
	
	In such cases, Windows defaults to the solid color nearest the dithered color
	selected.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Windows uses a technique called "dithering" to provide a larger number of colors
	than the default for a given display type. A dithered color is actually a
	combination of available colors that gives the appearance of a new color.
	
	Dithered colors cannot be applied to the following screen elements of the Windows
	desktop:
	
	- Window text
	
	- Window background
	
	- Menu bar
	
	- Menu text
	
	- Title bar text
