	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may experience video display problems when you run Microsoft Windows version
	3.0 on an Epson 286 or 386SX laptop. Windows may appear to extend past the
	boundaries of the monitor. This problem usually occurs when you use the built-in
	LCD display, but may also occur if you are connected to an external EGA or VGA
	monitor.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Epson has a Windows video device driver, called LTWIN.DRV, that corrects this
	problem. This device driver is available from Epson dealers or the Epson
	technical support bulletin board service (BBS).
	
	This driver is only for the LT386SX machine. It is used to correct display
	problems with Windows 386, Windows 3.0, and OS/2 version 1.1. The driver is
	available on CompuServe forums for Epson. The driver file is self- extracting
	and includes readme files.
