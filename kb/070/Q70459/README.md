	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot load graphics created in formats such as TIFF or HPGL in Microsoft
	Windows Paintbrush or paste text into Paintbrush.
	
	You can work around this problem by copying the graphics or text to the Clipboard
	(using ALT+PRINT SCREEN) and pasting the image into Paintbrush.
	
	NOTE: Text pasted into Paintbrush using this procedure cannot be edited later. In
	addition, this procedure works only if the graphic or text selection is smaller
	than full screen.

	To copy a picture or text into Paintbrush:

	  a Windows bitmap.
	
	3. Minimize or close the source application.
	
	4. Start and maximize Paintbrush.
