	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A problem exists in Aircraft & Scenery Designer (ASD) when creating runways
	at the Catalina Airport (coordinates 15149 N, 5744 E, 1602 ALT). Runways may
	disappear when exiting the "Add Runways" menu and returning to the simulator;
	however, they appear when viewed from the top at altitudes above 1602 feet.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ASD. We are researching this
	problem and will post the new information as it becomes available.
