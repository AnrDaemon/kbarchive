	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to save a Microsoft MapPoint mao as a Web page to a network
	server, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  You don't have permission to save files in this location. If you are
	  attempting to save to a floppy disk, verify that the disk is not
	  write-protected.
	
	NOTE: Because you can save a folder in MapPoint to the server without receiving
	this error message, you do have permission to save files and folders to the
	server.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if your network operating system does not support long
	file names.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
