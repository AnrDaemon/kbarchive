	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MapPoint 2000 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to save a Microsoft MapPoint 2000 map to a floppy disk, you may
	receive the following error message:
	
	  The disk is full. Please delete unneeded files or save your map to another
	  disk or drive.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you attempt to save more than one map as a Web page
	to the same floppy disk.
	
	NOTE: You receive this message even if sufficient space remains on on the floppy
	disk to store the additional map.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, save only one map to a floppy disk when you save a
	map as a Web page.
	
	If you want to save multiple maps to the same floppy disk, you must save the
	additional maps in the MapPoint Map or Map Template formats.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft MapPoint 2000.
