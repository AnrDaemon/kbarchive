	When you use the Data Mapping wizard to map a Shaded Area Map in Microsoft
	MapPoint, the program may stop responding (hang).

	  quantity of data needed to map two or more Shaded Area Maps to one MapPoint
	  map.
	
	RESOLUTION

	To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:
	
	- Map only one Shaded Area Map to one MapPoint map.
	
	- Select one of the following map styles to map data in MapPoint:
	
	   - Pushpin Map
	   - Shaded Circle
	   - Sized Circle Map
