	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article provides a list of tools you can use to simulate load for your Web
	applications. By simulating load for your application, you can test concurrency
	issues as well as better understand how your application behaves under stress.
	Testing load and concurrency by refreshing a browser is not considered a valid
	test.

	Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
	posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
	servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.
	
	With these tools you can stress test your Web server to see how it reacts when
	several hundred users access your application at peak times. These tools can
	also be used to test the server-side components for performance, locks, and
	other scalability issues. A Web application that relies on databases can also be
	tested on parameters such as concurrency, transactions, number of users, locks,
	pooling, and so forth.
