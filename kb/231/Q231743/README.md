	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word 97, when you print a document with a table of contents, or
	with several lines containing dot leaders with right-aligned tabs, the dot
	leaders may not line up correctly, or the dot leaders may print over text in the
	document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because of an issue with the printer driver.
	
	This behavior can occur if all of the following conditions are true:
	
	- The dot leader lines are formatted in 11 point Arial font.
	
	- You are using a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation-based computer.
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3 is installed on the computer.
	
	- The document is printed to a Hewlett Packard (HP) LaserJet 4si or 5si
	  printer.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, or contact
	Hewlett Packard to obtain an appropriate printer driver for the LaserJet 4si or
	5si printer.
