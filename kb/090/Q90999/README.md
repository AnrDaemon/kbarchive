	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If two users attempt to open a JustWrite 2.0 or AMI Pro document at the same
	time over the network, both users are able to modify the file, and any changes
	made by one of them are lost. The intended behavior is that the first user gets
	exclusive access, and the second gets read-only access.
	
	At present, it is recommend that multiple users NOT use these applications with
	the same file at the same time, even though the AMI Pro version 2.0 is
	advertised as a "Networked" version.
