	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	One method to increase the speed of a FoxBASE+ application is to substitute the
	SEEK command for the FIND command.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The SEEK command is faster than the FIND command. The FIND command uses a macro
	substitution when it searches for a memory variable; the SEEK command does not.
	
	The FIND command is included in FoxBASE+ version 2.1 for compatibility with
	previous versions of FoxBASE+.
