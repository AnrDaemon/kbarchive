	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Leading Technology PC Partner computer with Microsoft Windows
	with the standard VGA driver installed, text is garbled after exiting Windows.
	
	The problem exists in both standard and enhanced mode. The screen continually
	displays binary characters or the video display is garbled after exiting
	Windows. The system then hangs and the only way to continue is to restart the
	computer.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Using the VGA (version 3.0) video driver supplied with Windows 3.1 corrects this
	problem.
