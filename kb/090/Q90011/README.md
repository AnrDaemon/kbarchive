	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may experience the following problems when using ClipBook Viewer to share
	ClipBook pages:
	
	Page Name Length and Display Problems
	-------------------------------------
	
	When you paste from the system Clipboard to the local Clipboard, you are prompted
	for a page name. The Paste dialog box limits the page name to 47 characters.
	However, in the local ClipBook window, the page name is displayed as a
	46-character string. Throughout the ClipBook Viewer dialog boxes, the page name
	may or may not be truncated by one or a half of a character. When you attempt to
	connect to another shared ClipBook page with a 47-character name, only about 35
	characters are visible. These problems do not prevent you from sharing pages or
	connecting to shared pages.
	
	Incorrect Positioning of Computer and Page Names
	------------------------------------------------
	
	In the Enter Network Password dialog box, the Computer Name and Page Name fields
	are not centered properly. Both names appear half a character higher than
	normal.
	
	No Context Sensitive Help in Enter Network Password Dialog Box
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When you attempt to connect to a shared ClipBook page that requires a password,
	no context-sensitive help (F1) is available. The Help button functions
	normally.
	
	Same Passwords for Full and Read-Only Access
	--------------------------------------------
	
	When you set the passwords for full and read-only access to your shared ClipBook
	pages, ClipBook allows you to use the same password for both types of access.
