	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	During installation, Windows Sound System Setup defaults to custom installation
	mode if it does not detect enough disk space to perform a complete installation.
	Even if you are only running Setup in order to add one program (for example,
	Proof Reader), you are forced into custom installation mode. All options are
	available as in a normal installation.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Sound System Setup
	version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	as it becomes available.
