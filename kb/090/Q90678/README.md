	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If your computer doesn't have an operating system installed, you can start your
	system with MS-DOS Upgrade Disk 1, but Setup won't run.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The MS-DOS Upgrade Setup Disk 1 is always bootable. In other words, The Setup
	Disk can be used to start up a computer if the hard disk drive is inaccessible,
	cannot be booted, or does not contain an operating system.
	
	However, the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade and later Setup programs do not run if there is no
	operating system on the computer. The MS-DOS Upgrade package is licensed, sold,
	and designed for users who have an existing copy of MS-DOS (or some other
	operating system) and who want to upgrade to MS-DOS 6.0 or later.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If your computer does not have an operating system installed, and you don't have
	your original operating system disks, you need to contact your computer
	manufacturer to obtain a copy of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
	version of Microsoft MS-DOS 6.2.
