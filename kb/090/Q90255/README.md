	When you choose the Network icon in Control Panel, no hardware
	detection is performed.
	
	The Network option may spend some time enumerating available
	workgroups. If you change any of the network adapter settings, or
	install any new drivers, the Network option checks for the presence of
	a disk compression utility such as Stacker or Squish and whether or
	not the Windows directory is on a compressed drive.
