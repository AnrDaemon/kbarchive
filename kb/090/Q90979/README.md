## Q90979: PPT: Slide Show Does Not Return to Previous Slide

{% raw %}

	Article: Q90979
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,4.0,4.0a,4.0c,7.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In PowerPoint and PowerPoint Viewer, the slide show keys for returning to the
	previous slide don't appear to work. For example, if the current slide is a
	build slide, pressing one of these keys returns to the previous bullet item on
	the current slide rather than the previous slide.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is normal behavior if the current slide is a build slide. The slide show
	keys actually return you to the previous screen, which in the case of a build
	slide, is a less complete build than the current slide.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To return to previous slide (screen) right-click the slide and then click
	Previous on the menu that appears or use any of the following shortcut keys:
	
	  BACKSPACE
	  P
	  LEFT ARROW
	  UP ARROW
	  PAGE UP
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You can go to a specific slide by typing the slide number on your keyboard and
	pressing ENTER. If you have PowerPoint 7.0, you can also use the Slide
	Navigator. For more information about using Slide Navigator, click the Find tab
	in PowerPoint Help, type the following text
	
	  "Slide Navigator" (without the quotation marks)
	
	and then double click "Go to a specific slide" to go to the "Go to a specific
	slide" topic.
