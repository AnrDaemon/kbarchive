	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you install Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 for a Microsoft
	compatible network and Workgroup Connections, you may receive network errors in
	Print Manager for redirected printer ports. The message "Network error" appears
	beside network print queues.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by a conflict with MSNET.DRV.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Workgroup Connections version 1.0
	and Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS version 3.11. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.
