	There is no functional difference between a Microsoft LAN Manager
	domain and a Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) workgroup. Both domain and
	workgroup refer to a logical grouping of servers and clients within a
	local area network (LAN).
	
	For example, finance domain means the same thing as finance workgroup.
