	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	You may notice that the recommended permanent swap file size is
	different in Windows for Workgroups Setup than it is in Control Panel.
	This is because Setup is running Windows for Workgroups in standard
	mode, while Control Panel is probably being run from enhanced mode
	Windows. The algorithm for calculating the recommended size of the
	permanent swap file differs in the two modes of Windows.
