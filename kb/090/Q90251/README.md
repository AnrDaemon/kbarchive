	In Hearts, when the cards are dealt, the positions of the cards that
	are passed and played can be discerned by other players. Dots appear
	adjacent to the cards to be passed, and played cards are realistically
	removed from players' hands.
	
	As your cards are always automatically sorted, it seems that you could
	predict roughly which cards other players have passed and played.
	However, this is not true. The positions that you see represent the
	other players' hands before the cards were sorted. Although the positioning
	is accurate for all players, it has nothing to do with the automatic
	sorting, giving you no real clues as to the cards your opponents are
	holding.
