	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	PSS Can Support Only WinLogin Administrators
	--------------------------------------------
	
	Microsoft PSS can support only WinLogin setup and usage when the system
	administrator is calling PSS. Microsoft requires that the system administrator
	calls so that our engineers can work with someone who has the proper tools and
	passwords to work with the WinLogin installation, to preserve the WinLogin
	security functionality.
	
	This policy DOES NOT affect Windows users who are running WinLogin and are having
	Windows usage problems.
	
	PSS Will Not Help Break WinLogin Password Protection
	----------------------------------------------------
	
	Microsoft PSS engineers will not help any user, including the system
	administrator break the password security in WinLogin. If you have forgotten
	your password, please see your system administrator. If you are the system
	administrator and have forgotten you password, your only solution is to
	reinstall the WinLogin database. This will let you define a new password, but
	will also destroy the original database and all data it contains, including user
	and workstation definitions and merge rules.
	
	PSS Will Not Help Users Disable WinLogin
	----------------------------------------
	
	In keeping with the above password security integrity, Microsoft PSS engineers
	cannot help customers, other than the WinLogin administrators, disable WinLogin
	nor do engineers tell them how to do it.
