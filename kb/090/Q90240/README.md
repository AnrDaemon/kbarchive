	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
	- Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections pop-up terminate
	and stay resident (TSR) program [started by typing "net start popup" (without the quotation marks)] does not function in a high-resolution
	graphics mode.
	
	If you attempt to start the pop-up TSR in an application such as the
	MS-DOS Shell version 5.0 in graphics mode, no pop-up dialog box
	appears.
