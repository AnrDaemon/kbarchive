	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Windows Sound System Quick Recorder, you may notice some garbled or
	unreadable text under the picture icon. The garbled text indicates that the
	digitized file has an attached label.
	
	The text actually says "Quick Recorder" in a 4-point font. This is by design. It
	indicates that there has been a label assigned to the .WAV file. There is no way
	of changing this functionality or changing the text to a larger font.
