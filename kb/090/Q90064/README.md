## Q90064: PPT: Cannot Find/Replace Quotation Marks or Apostrophe

	Article: Q90064
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
	Version(s): MACINTOSH:4.0; WINDOWS:4.0,7.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to find or replace quotation marks or apostrophes (or words
	that contain them) in PowerPoint, the search does not find any or all marks,
	even though they exist.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if the presentation contains curly (or "smart") quotation
	marks or apostrophes rather than standard (or straight) quotation marks or
	apostrophes. When you enter a quotation mark or apostrophe in the Find What box
	in the Find dialog box or the Replace dialog box, a standard quotation mark or
	apostrophe is entered rather than a curly quotation mark or apostrophe.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Windows
	-------
	
	To find smart quotes, you must type the appropriate Windows shortcut keys in the
	Find What box. To do this, use one of the following shortcut keys in the Find
	What box:
	
	  ALT+0148 (opening curly quotation mark)
	  ALT+0149 (closing curly quotation mark)
	  ALT+0145 (opening curly apostrophe)
	  ALT+0146 (closing curly apostrophe)
	
	NOTE: The character that appears in the Find What box after you press and release
	the appropriate key combination may not appear as a smart quote.
	
	Macintosh
	---------
	
	To find smart quotes, you must type the appropriate key caps combination in the
	Find What box. To do this, use one of the following shortcut keys in the Find
	What box:
	
	  OPTION+[ (opening curly quotation mark)
	  OPTION+SHIFT+[ (closing curly quotation mark)
	  OPTION+] (opening curly apostrophe)
	  OPTION+SHIFT+] (closing curly apostrophe)
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Smart Quotes feature only works with fonts (such as TrueType fonts) that
	support the ANSI characters 148 and 149.
	
	To enter curly or "smart" quotation marks or apostrophes you must turn on the
	Smart Quotes feature in PowerPoint. For more information about smart quotation
	marks, click the Index tab in PowerPoint Help, type the following text:
	
	  "smart quotes" (without the quotation marks)
	
	and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Replace straight quotes
	with smart quotes as I type" topic.
