## Q90232: Shared Folder Icons May Revert to Standard Folder Icons

	Article: Q90232
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The list of current share names, passwords, and comments is stored in a cache or
	buffer. If you share a large number of resources, the size of the share list
	exceeds the buffer size, dumping the list entirely. This results in shared
	folder icons (with hands) reverting to standard folder icons (no hands) in both
	the main File Manager directory listing and Connect dialog box. Also, the share
	confirmation dialog box no longer appears when you remove or rename a shared
	resource.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups File
	Manager version 3.1 and version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will
	post new information here as it becomes available.
