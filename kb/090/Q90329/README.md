	When connecting to a network drive in Windows for Workgroups File
	Manager, you cannot assign a local drive letter as a network drive.
	You can only assign a network drive to a drive letter after your last
	hard disk.
	
	However, this can be done by executing an MS-DOS command prompt
	through Windows, then connecting and assigning the drive using
	MS-DOS-level network connection utilities.
