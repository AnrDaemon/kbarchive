	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the Movie Listings section of Cinemania, you are allowed to use Index Filters
	to narrow the focus of your search. Within the Index Filters there is a Star
	Rating category which is based on a 1 to 4 scale. The 1 to 4 rating is based on
	"Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide 1992" which contains capsule reviews of
	over 19,000 movies.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Motion pictures in Cinemania which have a 5 star rating are in the Detailed
	Review and are listings from "The Motion Picture Guide." Cinemania contains only
	750 reviews from "The Motion Picture Guide" and are therefore not included in
	filtering. Cinemania contains content from three sources; "Leonard Maltin's
	Movie and Video Guide 1992," "The Motion Picture Guide," and "The Encyclopedia
	of Film."
