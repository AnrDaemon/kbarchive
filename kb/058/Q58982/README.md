	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When the AppleLink Comm program starts up, it checks for a folder named
	AppleLink Out Basket in the System Folder. If this folder does not exist,
	AppleLink Comm creates it. Nothing is done if it already exists.
	
	Outgoing mail messages are written in the AppleLink Out Basket folder by the
	AppleLink gateway. AppleLink Comm then connects with AppleLink to send this
	outgoing mail and to receive any incoming mail.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
	should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
	Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
	the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
	User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
	Service at (206) 936-8661, but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
	Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
	GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
	server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.
