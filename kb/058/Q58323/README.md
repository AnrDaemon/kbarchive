	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can control the default text characteristics for new objects you create by
	using the Text Tool:
	
	1. Click the Selection Tool, and then click a blank area of your slide. This
	  ensures that no objects are selected.
	
	2. To change the default alignment, use the procedure appropriate for your
	  version of PowerPoint.
	
	     PowerPoint 4.0, 7.0
	     -------------------
	
	     On the Format menu, point to Alignment, and then click the appropriate submenu command.
	
	     PowerPoint 3.x
	     --------------
	
	     On the Text menu, click Alignment and select from among the submenu
	     alignment options.
	
	     PowerPoint 2.x
	     --------------
	
	     On the Text menu, click Left, Center, Right, or Justify.
	
	The text, label, or word processor objects you create now follow the new default
	you selected.
	
	This does not affect the default alignment for Title and Body objects because
	that is controlled by the alignment formatting of the corresponding objects on
	the Slide Master and Notes Master.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can set up a default presentation, so that the defaults you select apply to
	all the new presentations you create. The default presentation can include all
	of your custom defaults for slides, notes, and handouts. If you do not create a
	default presentation file, PowerPoint uses its own defaults.
	
	In order for the changes to drawing object attributes and text object attributes
	to be saved as the defaults for new presentations, you must take one more step.
	
	For text objects:
	
	- Select the text with the desired attributes. On the Format menu, click "Pick
	  Up Text Style," click anywhere in the slide background, and then click "Apply
	  To Text Defaults."
	
	For drawing objects:
	
	Select the object after applying the attributes you want. On the Format menu,
	click "Pick Up Object Style," click anywhere in the slide background, make sure
	nothing else is selected, and then click "Apply To Object Defaults" on the
	Format menu.
	
	In PowerPoint for Windows 4.0, the default presentation is called Blank
	Presentation.pot and in PowerPoint 3.x and 4.0 for the Macintosh, the default
	presentation is called Default.ppt.
