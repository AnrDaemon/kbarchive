	If you have used all the standard procedures for installation and Microsoft
	Windows stops responding (hangs) or performs inconsistently, check the size
	of .COM and .EXE files to see if the size is within normal limits. Some
	computer viruses can increase the size of .COM and .EXE files. If Windows
	does not run properly after setting it up with the correct options, check
	these file sizes to determine if a virus has infected the system.
