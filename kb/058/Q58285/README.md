## Q58285: &quot;Ugly&quot; Colors on 512K 8514 Adapter

	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

	The Microsoft Windows 3.0 8514 driver color table is attuned to the
	256-color mode, which requires the IBM 8514 Memory Expansion Kit (to a
	total of 1 MB). The colors used may not be as pleasing to the eye when
	used on the adapter without the Memory Expansion Kit because it yields a
	16-color mode rather than a 256-color mode.
	
	Microsoft is aware of this limitation in the 8514 driver. We are
	researching this feature and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
	
	Please note that the Windows 2.x driver for the 8514 adapter requires the
	Memory Expansion Kit and will not work without it installed.
