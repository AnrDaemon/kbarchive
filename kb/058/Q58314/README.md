	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Microsoft Windows version 3.0 includes new versions of the MS-DOS mouse
	drivers MOUSE.COM, MOUSE.SYS, MOUSEHP.COM, and MOUSEHP.SYS.
	
	Normally, Windows 3.0 Setup automatically replaces older mouse drivers on
	your hard disk with the new version. However, if you choose to not let
	Setup modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, or if your mouse
	driver is not listed in your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the new
	version isn't installed.
	
	Make sure you are running the DOS mouse driver included with Windows
	3.0. This can be verified by checking file dates. Older mouse drivers
	can cause problems.
