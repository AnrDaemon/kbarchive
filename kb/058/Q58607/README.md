	In the QB Advisor online Help system for Microsoft QuickBASIC Version
	4.50, several subtopics under the "HELP: Selected Programs" topic
	incorrectly claim to contain several examples, but contain only one.
	
	To find this error, run QB.EXE Version 4.50. Press ALT+H+C to choose
	the Contents command, which displays the "HELP: Table of Contents"
	window. Choose the Selected Programs button.
	
	The following "HELP: Selected Programs" subtopics contain only one
	example, contrary to a statement in each subtopic:
	
	1. Control Flow programs
	2. Error and Event Trapping programs
	3. Graphics programs
	4. Programs that demonstrate how to construct functions
	   and procedures
	
	Note: To see additional QuickBASIC code examples for these topics, see
	the example programs shipped with QuickBASIC Version 4.50.
