	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Mail version 3.00 allows you to create personal groups of those users
	you frequently send messages to through the Personal Groups command (on the Mail
	menu).
	
	In Microsoft Mail version 2.00, a user cannot create his or her own personal
	groups unless that user is the Network Manager. However, since it is possible to
	paste text into the Names box on the addressing screen, an alternative to this
	is to save a list of names separated by semicolons in the Scrapbook, then recall
	them later when addressing a mail message.
	
	To save a list of names in the Scrapbook, do the following:
	
	1. Open a word processing program.
	
	2. Type the names of the users in the group, separating each name with a
	  semicolon. Do not insert spaces or other characters except where they appear
	  in the user names.
	
	3. Copy these names without copying the end-of-line character.
	
	4. From the Apple menu, choose Scrapbook, then choose Paste from the Edit menu.
	
	To use these names from the Scrapbook to address a mail message, do the
	following:
	
	1. From the Apple menu, choose Scrapbook and move to the screen that contains
	  the desired list of names.
	
	2. From the Edit menu, choose Copy to copy the names.
	
	3. From the Apple menu, choose Microsoft Mail 2.0 and select the type of message
	  to send.
	
	4. Click the Address icon, then press COMMAND+V to paste the names into the
	  Names box. Mail will not allow Paste to be chosen from the Edit menu using
	  the mouse.
