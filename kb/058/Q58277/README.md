	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following EGA displays are supported under Windows Versions 2.x but are not
	supported under Windows 3.0 or later:
	
	  EGA with high-resolution color display (black and white)
	  EGA with high-resolution monochrome display
	  EGA with low-resolution color display
	
	The only EGA selection for Windows 3.0 and later is "EGA Color," which
	corresponds to the Windows 2.x "EGA with High-Resolution Color Display"
	selection.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Windows 2.x works correctly with EGA cards with less than 256K of memory
	installed, including the display selections that are no longer supported.
	Windows 3.0 and later requires EGA cards with 256K of memory installed.
	
	The only workaround for EGA cards with less than 256K of memory is to select CGA.
	Note: This workaround will not work with Windows 3.1 unless you have the CGA
	driver, which does not come with Windows 3.1.
	
	Additional query words: 3.0 3.00 3.1 3.10 3.00a 3.11
