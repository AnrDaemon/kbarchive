	Article: Q58019
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 6.00 6.00b | 6.00 6.00b
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS | OS/2

	On Page 10 of the "Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.0: User's Guide," Table
	3.1 incorrectly states that NOVGA.OBJ removes support for screen mode
	3 features. The chart should actually show the following:
	
	   NOVGA.OBJ    Video Graphics Array (VGA) features (screen modes
	                11, 12, and 13) absent.
	
	This correction applies to the user's guide for Microsoft BASIC
	Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
	
	This documentation error was corrected in the documentation for
	Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for
	MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
