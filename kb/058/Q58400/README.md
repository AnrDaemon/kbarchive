	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	One of Microsoft's promotional advertisements for Flight Simulator Version 4.00
	shows a picture of the experimental aircraft that, as the caption states, has
	been modified to resemble a B-2 bomber.
	
	It is not possible to produce this design in Flight Simulator Version 4.00
	because of limits on the design parameters that were established in accordance
	with the flight equations.
