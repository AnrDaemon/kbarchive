	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Using Radio Buttons
	
	Like on your car radio, only one radio button can be selected at any one time.
	
	To change the radio buttons, simply click the appropriate button you wish to
	select. You can toggle back and forth between all available radio buttons, but
	only one can be selected.
	
	Using checkboxes
	
	With a checkbox you can select the items appropriate to what you're doing or
	describing. You can select as many or as few as apply.
	
	Checkboxes can simply be toggled by clicking the box to either enter or remove
	the check.
	
	Using selection boxes
	
	The selection box lets you choose one of a set of answers while not taking up a
	lot of space on the page. Typically, instructions will be printed inside the box
	itself.
	
	You can click the drop arrow of the box to show the list of available
	answers/options, and simply click the desired selection.
	
	Using input boxes The input box lets you manually type information into a text
	box. Typically, instructions will be printed around the box indicating the kind
	of information to type.
	
	To use an input box
	
	1. Move the cursor into the input box.
	
	2. You should see a blinking vertical line; this is your insertion point.
	
	3. Use the keyboard to type.
	
	4. If you make a mistake, use the backspace key to erase.
	
	5. When you are finished click go.
