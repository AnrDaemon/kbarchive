	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The MSN Companion is designed to remain on all the time. However, when it is not
	in use, it can be "put to sleep."
	
	When the MSN Companion unit is asleep, the unit will display a picture instead of
	just a blank screen. This gives the unit the look of a framed picture instead of
	a computer screen.
	
	You may select the picture you want to display, or you may have no picture when
	the machine is off.
