	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSN Companion, versions 1.0, 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Subscribers want to change the friendly name that displays when they send e-mail
	or instant messages. For example, a subscriber might want to change from "Robert
	Smith" to "Bob Smith".
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The name that appears in e-mail and instant messages is set by default when
	subscribers sign up for accounts. The billing name the subscriber provides is
	the default e-mail name that MSN Companion will use.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	1. Click start, and then click settings.
	
	2. Click my account, and then click change information.
	
	3. Type in the first name (e-mail) and last name (e-mail) boxes to change the
	  information as needed.
	
	4. Click the done button.
	
	5. After the page reloads and shows your newly chosen display name, click start.
	
	6. Press the power button to turn the device off, and then press the power
	  button again to restart MSN Companion.
	  Your e-mail and instant messaging display names will now be updated with your
	  changes.
