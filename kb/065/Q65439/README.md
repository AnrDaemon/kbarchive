	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may experience garbled video output when you run Microsoft Windows version
	3.0 in enhanced mode on a Northgate Elegance 386 with 64K RAM cache.
	
	This only occurs when the Northgate is in Turbo mode.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, set dip switch #4 on the video card to OFF. This will
	prevent the video from buffering the image in Turbo mode and allow Windows to
	write directly to the screen.
