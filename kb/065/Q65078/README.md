	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Texas Instruments TI 865 printer is not directly supported by Microsoft
	Windows version 3.0. It has been reported that it can emulate the Texas
	Instruments TI 855 printer. The major difference between the TI 865 and its
	predecessor the TI 855, is that the TI 865 is able to handle different sizes of
	paper.
