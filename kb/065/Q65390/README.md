	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are recording a message using the Microsoft Mail voice form, the form
	may stop recording before the time limit expires. The cause of this may be one
	of two things:
	
	1. The mouse was moved while recording. Any mouse movement automatically stops
	  message recording and returns the user to the form screen.
	
	2. A key was pressed. Pressing a key on the keyboard also halts message
	  recording and returns the user to the form screen.
