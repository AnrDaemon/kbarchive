	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The 286 desktop Zenith with the 84-key keyboard may miss or repeat keystrokes
	when you are using Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is due to a problem with the scan controller in the keyboard.
	Zenith does not plan to update the controller because the chip is not removable.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only solution is to upgrade to a different keyboard that the ROM BIOS and
	systems control processor are able to support. A Zenith 101-key keyboard or a
	compatible 84-key keyboard other than Zenith's may resolve this problem.
