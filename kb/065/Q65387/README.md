	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot create a custom voice Mail form with the Microsoft Mail Form
	Designer. A voice Mail form needs special resources in order to function. The
	Form Designer currently does not support the installation of voice Mail
	resources on a customized Mail form.
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
	release.
