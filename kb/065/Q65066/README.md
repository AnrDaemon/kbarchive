	The Microsoft Mail server beeps twice when the server INIT loads on
	start-up if the "Microsoft Mail Server Patch" file is in the System
	Folder.
	
	This "Microsoft Mail Server Patch" file was used with Microsoft Mail
	versions 1.36 and 1.37 to provide compatibility with System 6.0. This
	patch is not needed with newer versions of Mail.
	
	To eliminate the beeping, drag the "Microsoft Mail Server Patch" file
	into the Trash and restart the Mail server.
