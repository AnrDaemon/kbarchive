	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Ventura Publisher runs successfully under Microsoft Windows version 3.0 if
	Ventura is installed with the lowest resolution graphics driver and there is
	plenty of conventional memory available before you start Windows. Ventura uses
	almost 590K to run, so there is little room for anything but MS-DOS loaded upon
	boot-up.
	
	You may experience some problems getting Ventura to recognize all of the expanded
	memory allocated to it from Windows, which can make Ventura run slowly.
