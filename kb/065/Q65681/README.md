	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Windows version 3.0 help text is normally displayed as green on
	color displays. This can be difficult to read on gas plasma displays. To correct
	this problem, do the following:
	
	1. From the Program Manager, select the Main program group.
	
	2. Select the Control Panel.
	
	3. Choose Colors.
	
	4. From the Color Scheme dialog box, select Fluorescent.
	
	5. Select Color Palette.
	
	6. From Screen Elements, select Window Background.
	
	7. From Basic Colors, (starting from the upper left,), select the color in
	  column 4, row 6.
	
	8. Choose OK.
	
	Note: For easier readability, you also may want to make the title bar text the
	same color (column 4, row 6).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you find this color arrangement acceptable, save the settings. You can do
	this by going back into the Color Palette, and clicking the Save Scheme button.
	(You must first go into the color palette to "enable" this button.) Windows then
	prompts you for a name to save it under. Enter a name (such as Toshiba), choose
	OK, and the new name appears in the Color Schemes box.
