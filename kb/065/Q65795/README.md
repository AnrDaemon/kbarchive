	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The AST fastboard, which is a 386 upgrade for AST 286 boards, is compatible with
	Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and can run in enhanced mode. If you experience
	problems running Windows on a machine equipped with this board, try the normal
	compatibility troubleshooting steps. If you still experience problems, do the
	following:
	
	1. Remove the AST memory driver ASTEMM.SYS from the CONFIG.SYS file.
	
	2. Verify that you are using an AMI BIOS, dated 1988 or later. A fastboard with
	  a Phoenix BIOS may not run in enhanced mode and may cause other problems in
	  standard mode.
	
	3. The updated PAL (programmable array logic) chip must be installed. Contact
	  AST for information about proper PAL configurations.
