	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can only run one instance of Recorder with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. If
	Recorder is already running, and you try to start a second instance of Recorder,
	the first instance of Recorder becomes the active window and no second instance
	appears.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If a macro file is run when the Recorder is running, the Recorder loads that
	file. If a macro file is already in the Recorder, and has unsaved changes, the
	Recorder brings up a dialog box asking if you want to save changes.
