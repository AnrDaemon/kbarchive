	=======
	
	The Micro Display Systems Genius 420 Monitor is a full-page monochrome monitor
	and adapter. This monitor requires a special video driver, supplied by Ran-Ger
	Technologies, Inc., to operate properly with Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
	
	To obtain this driver, contact Ran-Ger Technologies. The file is available as a
	self-extracting executable called GIWIN3.EXE.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Genius Monitor may be used with Windows 3.0 without the Micro Display
	Systems driver if you do the following:
	
	1. Put the Genius Monitor in CGA mode. In the Genius directory on the hard disk,
	  there is a file named VHR.COM. Run this program by typing "VHR CGA" (without
	  the quotation marks) to put the Genius Monitor in CGA mode.
	
	2. Add the command "VHR CGA" (without the quotation marks) to your AUTOEXEC.BAT
	  file or run this program before you run Windows.
	
	3. Install Windows and choose CGA graphics adapter as your display.
