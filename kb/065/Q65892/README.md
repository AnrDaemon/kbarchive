	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you are using the optional 101-key, plug-in keyboard on a COMPAQ SLT/286 with
	Microsoft Windows version 3.0, choose "PC-XT type 84 key" keyboard when
	installing Windows. This keyboard does not function properly if Windows is
	installed for a 101-key keyboard.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Even with the 101-key keyboard plugged into the SLT/286, the keyboard controller
	chip is still set up for an 84-key keyboard. This controller is not capable of
	using the codes for an actual 101-key keyboard. The extended keyboard keys, such
	as F11, F12, and the CTRL+arrow keys sequence, cannot be used with the 101-key
	keyboard on a COMPAQ SLT/286.

	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
	or reliability.
