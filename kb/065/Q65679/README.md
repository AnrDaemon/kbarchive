	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you run more than one instance of the same MS-DOS-based program at a time
	under Microsoft Windows version 3.0, Windows can identify the different
	instances with a number of dots. For example, the MS-DOS Prompt is normally
	labeled "COMMAND." under its icon when minimized. The second MS-DOS Prompt will
	be labeled "COMMAND.." under its icon. The third will be labeled as "COMMAND..."
	under its icon.
	
	The information in this article applies to Windows 3.0 and 3.0a; it does not
	apply to later versions of Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you use ALT+TAB to switch between programs, the different number of dots
	will display at the top of the screen with the program name. This feature can be
	used to identify which of several different, otherwise identical programs is
	currently selected without actually entering the program instance.
