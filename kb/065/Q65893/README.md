	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot apply shading to font based-text on the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
	Series II family of laser printers. Text that appears colored or shaded on
	screen prints as black on an HP LaserJet. The one exception is that white text
	does not print at all.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Cartridge and soft fonts are bitmapped images of the actual characters. The only
	way to get a font to show a pattern is to create it with that pattern.
