	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The LinkAge 3.2 Connectors are not certified for year 2000 compliance and there
	are no plans to do so. The connectors include the following:
	
	- LinkAge 3.2 Notes Connector
	- LinkAge 3.2 PROFS Connector
	- LinkAge 3.2 SNADS Connector
	- LinkAge 3.2 cc:Mail Connector
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	There is an easy upgrade path for these connectors to the Microsoft Exchange
	Server 5.5 version. The Exchange Server 5.5 version of these new connectors is
	fully supported and has been vigorously tested for year 2000 compliance.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Upgrade to the new Exchange Server 5.5 version of these connectors.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft confirms this to be a problem with the older LinkAge software.
