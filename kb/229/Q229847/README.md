	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Visual Basic 6.0 does not support 16-bit development. Microsoft has chosen to
	dedicate its efforts to the more scalable and higher-performance 32-bit
	platform. By focusing the development team on one 32-bit product, we were able
	to add many new features to Visual Basic 6.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Visual Basic 6.0 can only create 32-bit executable programs. If you need to
	develop 16-bit Windows applications with Microsoft Visual Basic, you should
	purchase Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0. This product targets both 16- and 32-bit
	Windows development and will remain on the market as long there is demand for
	16-bit development tools.
