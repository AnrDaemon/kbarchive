	MCSE stands for "Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer." On the book cover's
	spine, the acronym is spelled "MSCE" by mistake.
	
	
	Page xii: Setup Instructions Incorrect
	--------------------------------------

	Change:
	"From the root directory of the compact disc, open the Assess folder and
	double-click the MP087.EXE file."
	
	To:
	"From the root directory of the compact disc, open the Assess folder and
	double-click the SETUP.EXE file."
	
	
	Page 338: Answer To Question 70-087.06.07.003 Is A Not B
	--------------------------------------------------------
	
	Page 338, Question 70-087.06.07.003:
	
	The NNTP Settings property sheet can be used to limit message size. Therefore,
	both optional results are achieved. The correct answer is A.
	
	Change answers A through C to:
	
	Answer A:
	"Correct. The proposed solution limits the number of concurrent users to 50,
	disconnects idle users after five minutes, and limits the maximum message size
	to 64 kilobytes."
	
	Answer B:
	"Incorrect. You would receive both optional results. You would receive one
	optional result by requiring idle connections to time out after 300 seconds (5
	minutes). The default setting is 600 seconds (10 minutes). You would receive the
	second option result by using the NNTP Settings property sheet to configure the
	maximum message size to 64 kilobytes."
	
	Answer C:
	"Incorrect. You would receive both optional results. You would receive one
	optional result by requiring idle connections to time out after 300 seconds (5
	minutes). The default setting is 600 seconds (10 minutes). You would receive the
	second option result by using the NNTP Settings property sheet to configure the
	maximum message size to 64 kilobytes."
