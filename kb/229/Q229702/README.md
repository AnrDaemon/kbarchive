	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	By default, the RPC Endpoint Mapper binds to all interfaces on a computer
	running Windows NT. To prevent the RPC Endpoint Mapper from binding to all
	interfaces, you must apply the following hotfix and create the registry entry
	below.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
	that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
	guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
	incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
	
	1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).
	
	2. Go to the following key:
	
	  Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RPCSS
	
	3. On the Edit menu, click Add, and then type:
	
	  ListenOnInternet
	
	  If this value is set to "Y", the RPCSS listens on all ports. If the value is
	  set to "N", RPCSS listens based on the current policy.
