	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When logging on at the console of a Windows Terminal Server computer or when
	using the Terminal Server client, Windows Terminal Server sends a netlogon
	datagram to the PDC querying for the PDC and opens a SAMR pipe and makes several
	LSA calls. This traffic should not be directly calling the PDC and should use
	any DC in the domain.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
	4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
