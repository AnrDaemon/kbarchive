	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The core Help file for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows has the
	same name (MSMAIL.HLP) as the Help file for versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft
	Mail for Windows. Installing either product over a previous installation
	replaces the file with the contents of the newer Help file. In this way, users
	might get the wrong or inappropriate Help file for Mail.
	
	The core Help file, which is largely obtained from version 3.0 of Mail for
	Windows, is named MSMAIL.HLP. In addition, the MSMAIL.HLP file that is currently
	implemented has Demo buttons that are non-functional and display error messages
	when chosen.
