	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows and connecting with
	a null Modem script, the Connection dialog shows Dialing and then displays a
	phone number.
	
	This is confusing and misleading, because no phone number is dialed while using a
	null modem connection.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
	Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
