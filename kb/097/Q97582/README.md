	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following characters, included in entries in Encarta, are printed
	incorrectly when you print them to a Hewlett Packard (HP) LaserJet III, LaserJet
	series II, or DeskJet 500 printer:
	
	- Copyright information overlaps text inside of pictures. To duplicate this
	  problem, enlarge and print "Formation of Geysers." The phrase "Microsoft
	  Illustration" overlaps the phrase "molten rock."
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on the HP LaserJet series II, but not on the HP
	  LaserJet III or HP DeskJet 500.
	
	- Degree symbols print as left-angle, space, or rectangle characters. To
	  duplicate this problem, print the caption from "Formation of Geysers."
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on all three printer models tested.
	
	- Double quotation marks are not printed. To duplicate this problem, print the
	  selection on the letter "A".
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on the HP LaserJet series II and LaserJet III, but
	  not on the HP DeskJet 500.
	
	- Subscript and superscript text prints as normal. To duplicate this problem,
	  print the selections "Acetaldehyde" and "e (mathematics)".
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on all three printer models tested.
	
	- A lower case letter C acute prints as lower case letter C cedilla (with an
	  accent below instead of above it). To duplicate this problem, print the
	  selection "Andric, Ivo".
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on all three printer models tested.
	
	- The date designations AD and BC print as lower case instead of in small caps.
	  To duplicate this problem, print the selection "Andros (Greece)."
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on all three printer models tested.
	
	- A double hyphen (--) prints as a rectangle character. To duplicate this
	  problem, print the selection "Angouleme, Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duc d'".
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on all three printer models tested.
	
	- The hieroglyph for the letter E prints as uppercase E dieresis (E with an
	  umlaut accent above it). To duplicate this problem, print the selection "E
	  (alphabet)".
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on all three printer models tested.
	
	- The double arrow used in chemical formulas prints as a plus sign (+). To
	  duplicate this problem, print the selection "Acids and Bases".
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on the HP LaserJet series II and LaserJet III, but
	  not on the HP DeskJet 500.
	
	- The math prime (') symbol does not print. To duplicate this problem, print
	  the selection "Ellipse".
	
	  NOTE: This problem occurs on the HP LaserJet series II, but not on the HP
	  LaserJet III or HP DeskJet 500.
