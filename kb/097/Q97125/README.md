	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After the end of the animation sequence "Ptolemaic System," your cursor may
	change from the normal arrow pointing tool to a miniature mouse icon, like the
	mouse icon in Control Panel.
	
	In Bookshelf 1992, the pointer remains an icon after this happens. In Bookshelf
	1993, the pointer turns back into a normal pointer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
