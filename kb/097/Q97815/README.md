	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Lexmark 4033 LAN Connection for Printers Model 1 does not work with LAN
	Manager 2.1 running on an IBM LAN server.
	
	It needs IBM Data Link Control (DLC) from OS/2 Extended Edition. The LAN Manager
	DLC (comtokr or the nokia software from Comm Server) does not work, probably due
	to some proprietary hooks in the 4033 redirection code.
