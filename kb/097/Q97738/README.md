	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to use the US-International keyboard layout to create
	accented characters.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you use the US-International keyboard layout, you should also use the
	English (International) language setting. To change these settings, choose the
	International icon in Control Panel.
	
	The US-International keyboard layout does not remap your standard US keyboard
	layout; instead, it creates international characters by assigning certain
	characters a strikeover function so that you can use them to add an accent or
	diacritical mark to a character. It also assigns new functions to the right-most
	ALT key. The following describes the features of the US-International Keyboard
	Layout:
	
	- When you press the APOSTROPHE (') key, QUOTATION MARK (") key, ACCENT GRAVE
	  (`) key, TILDE (~) key, ACCENT CIRCUMFLEX key, or CARET (^) key, nothing
	  appears on the screen until you press the a second key. If you press one of
	  the letters designated as eligible to receive an accent mark, the accented
	  version of the letter appears. If you press an ineligible key, two separate
	  characters appear. In other words, the US-International keyboard layout
	  dynamic-link library (DLL) automatically accents letters that customarily
	  receive an accent but does not automatically accent letters that do not
	  customarily receive an accent.
	
	- The right-most ALT key activates additional functions for the
	  APOSTROPHE/QUOTATION MARK key. As a result, the right-most ALT key no longer
	  performs Windows functions. You must use the left-most ALT key to perform
	  Windows functions and as part of key combinations in Windows (such as ALT+TAB
	  or ALT+F4) or Windows-based applications (such as ALT+F1 in Word for
	  Windows).
	
	- You can press the right-most ALT key plus another character to produce some
	  common extended characters. Most keys on the keyboard produce one or two
	  extended characters in combination with the right-most ALT key. The following
	  table lists some of the extended characters you can produce with the
	  right-most ALT+<character> key combination:
	
	  Note: This is an incomplete list due to the difficulty of displaying extended
	  characters in some environments.
	
	  Key Combination                Result
	  ----------------------------------------------------------
	
	  Right-most ALT+r               Registered trademark symbol
	
	  Right-most ALT+c               Copyright symbol
	
	  Right-most ALT+z               ae symbol
	
	  Right-most ALT+Z               AE symbol
	
	- If you want to type one of these characters (an APOSTROPHE, QUOTATION MARK,
	  CARET, TILDE, or ACCENT GRAVE) followed by an unaccented letter, press the
	  SPACEBAR after you press the key. For example, to type "A girl named Sally,"
	  press the QUOTATION MARK key, then press the SPACEBAR, then press A.
	
	The following table lists the accented characters you can create using the
	US-International keyboard layout:
