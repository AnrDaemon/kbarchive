	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Mail Remote version 3.2 for Windows, an attempt to open a packaged
	item fails.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	A packaged item is one method to associate a file and its contents with a
	location that the recipients can access through a network connection. A package
	is an alternative to sending the file through the mail system.
	
	Because Mail Remote for Windows does not provide active access to the network, an
	attempt to open the packaged item fails when it cannot find the file to which it
	is associated.
