	- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows does not support listening in
	the background for incoming telephone calls as version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
	Remote for MS-DOS does. This behavior reflects a Mail Remote for Windows design
	limitation.
	
	Mail Remote for Windows does not support multitasking, switching tasks, or
	background processing while the modem is active. Mail Remote for Windows
	supports using the modem only to call the postoffice to send and receive mail
	messages.
	
	If you need to contact your postoffice frequently, you can use the Session Setup
	command on the Mail menu to schedule connection times.
	
	Mail Remote for Windows does not support the LISTEN function that Mail Remote for
	MS-DOS provides.
