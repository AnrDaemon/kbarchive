	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Windows version 3.0 adds three-dimensional (3-D) support for
	pushbuttons, but all other controls appear two-dimensional (2-D) by default.
	There is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that describes how an
	application can add 3-D effects to all controls by using the CTL3D Dynamic-Link
	Library (CTL3D.DLL).
