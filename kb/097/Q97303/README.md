	A toolbar consists of a row of small, graphical buttons usually placed across the
	top of a window. It gives the user a fast and convenient alternative to using
	the window's menu to perform operations. The menu provides a more easily
	understood way to activate a function and includes a keyboard interface to the
	function. A toolbar, on the other hand, gives the experienced user a shortcut to
	operations, and thus improves the usability of an application.
	
	TOOLBAR is a companion sample application for the "Creating a Toolbar" technical
	article on the Microsoft Developer Network CD.
	
	TOOLBAR was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1. The sample also
	builds and runs under Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 and Visual C++ version 1.0.
