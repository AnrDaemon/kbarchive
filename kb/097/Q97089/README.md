	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia entry on Trigonometry contains a graphic that
	is missing the right-hand border.
	
	If you copy the graphic to the Windows clipboard, the right-hand border is still
	missing. However, the border does appear correctly in Bit Edit.
	
	This problem is corrected in Bookshelf 1993.
