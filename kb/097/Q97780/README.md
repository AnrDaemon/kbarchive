	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you try to start Beethoven version 1.0 on a computer with a Magnavox 461
	CD-ROM drive, the following error message appears:
	
	  The wrong disk is in the CD-ROM drive. Please insert the Multimedia Beethoven
	  CD. Click retry...
	
	This problem occurs because the Magnavox 461 CD-ROM drive is not Multimedia PC
	(MPC) compliant, and because Beethoven checks for the length of the CD, which
	the Magnavox driver incorrectly reports.
	
	Beethoven 1.1 checks for tracks and audio length. This error should not occur in
	Beethoven 1.1.
