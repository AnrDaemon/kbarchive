	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you print entries from Musical Instruments, you may find that the graphics
	print at a low resolution. This product was primarily designed to be viewed on
	your screen and not for printing. For more information on printing from Musical
	Instruments, see the program's README.TXT file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The pictures in Musical Instruments are anti-aliased. Each picture is composed
	of combinations of black and gray pixels. The pictures were designed to display
	well on the screen. However, because of the anti-aliasing, they do not have a
	high print quality.
	
	You can see the alternated pixels of black and gray if you copy a graphic to a
	utility such as BitEdit or IconEdit, which allows you to view the individual
	pixels of which the picture is made.
