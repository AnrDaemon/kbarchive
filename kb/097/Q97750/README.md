	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When installing version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows and using the
	Custom Setup option, one of the options listed is Microsoft Mail Demos and
	Tutorials. This option is unavailable (gray).
	
	Also, at the end of installation, the Mail Setup dialog box has a Run Demo button
	that is dimmed and unavailable.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The option is unavailable by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	So that information is not repeated, the demos are not shipped with Mail Remote
	for Windows.
	
	Mail Remote for Windows shares a common SETUP.EXE with the network version of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows, which does include the demos.
	
	These options are dimmed because they are unavailable; they cannot be removed
	from the common SETUP.EXE.
	
	
	Additional query words: 3.20 grey dimmed
