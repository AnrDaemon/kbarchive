	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article presents a usable explanation of the GetGlyphOutline() function.
	Rather than being a complete guide, it is intended to complement and complete
	the definition found in the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Software Development
	Kit (SDK) Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions. To follow the discussion,
	the reader should be familiar with the information on GetGlyphOutline() in the
	SDK and the basic theory of the TrueType font engine. A sample application,
	GLYPH, is included on the Microsoft Developer Network CD to illustrate the basic
	concepts and mechanisms in this article.
