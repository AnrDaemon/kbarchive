	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Encarta for Windows 1993 edition 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Encarta MindMaze game allows you to give more than one player the same name.
	This can lead to the loss of the first player's .sav file (the file where the
	player's scores are kept).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MindMaze version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	Steps to Reproduce the Problem
	------------------------------
	
	1. Start MindMaze by selecting MindMaze Game from the Menu.
	
	2. Enter a first name (for example, "Zeke") in the First Name box.
	
	3. Enter a last name (for example, "Smith") in the Last Name box.
	
	4. Click the Done button.
	
	5. Answer one question.
	
	6. From the File menu, select Add A Player.
	
	7. Enter the same first name (Zeke) in the First Name box.
	
	8. Enter the same last name (Smith) in the Last Name box.
	
	9. Click the Done button.
	
	If you look at the score card, you will see that there are two players listed
	with the same name and different scores. This can be a problem, because the
	scores of the second player can overwrite the scores of the first player. This
	occurs because the .SAV files have the same name (in this case, ZEKESMIT.SAV).
