	Word for Windows, the first line of text is incorrectly formatted. The first
	line is bold and underlined in 12 point Arial. The rest of the text is formatted
	for Times New Roman 10 point. All the text should be formatted for Times New
	Roman 10 point, and none of it should be bold or underlined.
