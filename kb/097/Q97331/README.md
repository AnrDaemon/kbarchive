	posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
	servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.
	
	An application for Microsoft Windows often needs to be launched from another
	Windows-based application. In addition to starting a second application,
	sometimes the primary application needs to know when the second application
	terminates.
	
	This technical article discusses the following points:
	
	- Several ways to start applications
	
	- An approach to finding applications not located on the current Windows search
	  path
	
	- A method for detecting whether an application is still running
	
	- Using the same Windows-based techniques for starting applications for MS-DOS
	
	APPEXEC, the sample application provided with this article, contains code that
	solves the problems involved in finding and starting one Windows-based
	application from another, as well as determining later whether that application
	is still running.
