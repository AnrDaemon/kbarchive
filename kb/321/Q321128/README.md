	   - Microsoft Works Suite 2002

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to start Streets & Trips, the program prompts you to insert the
	Microsoft Works Suite 2002 CD-ROM.

	typical or minimum Works Suite installation, which includes a standard
	installation of Streets & Trips. The standard installation does not copy the

	Streets & Trips copies the map files.
