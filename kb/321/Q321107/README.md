## Q321107: INFO: Visual SourceSafe Integration Is Not Available

	Article: Q321107
	Product(s): Microsoft SourceSafe
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 13-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c 
	- Microsoft Visual C#.NET (2002) 
	- Microsoft Visual Basic.NET (2002) 
	- Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The source control integration menus are not available in the stand-alone
	editions of Visual C# .NET, Visual Basic .NET, or Visual C++ .NET.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	To use the source control integration with the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
	languages, you must have the full version of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
	Professional, Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Developer, or Microsoft
	Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Architect. The Visual Studio .NET development
	suite provides built-in support for source control operations in the development
	environment.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To use version control with these products, you must use Visual SourceSafe
	Explorer to add your projects to source control and to perform source control
	commands such as Checkin and Checkout.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
