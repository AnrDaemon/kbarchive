	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Bitstream Fontware does not properly install screen fonts for an 8514/A screen
	driver under Microsoft Windows version 3.0. The fonts print; however, they do
	not display correctly on the screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	It appears that the aspect ratio for the screen driver included with Windows 3.0
	has been changed from version 2.x. However, Bitstream Fontware has not been
	updated to work with the new driver.
