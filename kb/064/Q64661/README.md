	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you are using an 84-key keyboard on a Sperry 286 computer, Windows Write may
	randomly select characters as you type, or may hang your computer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Unisys has confirmed this to be a problem with the computer.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only workaround is to use a 101- or 102-key enhanced keyboard.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Other problems reported by Unisys when using an 84-key keyboard include the
	following:
	
	1. Microsoft Windows version 3.0 stops (hangs) during setup when you insert Disk
	  2.
	
	2. Windows 3.0 hangs during installation (when the real mode is running).
	
	3. Windows 3.0 hangs at the logo screen unless win/r is typed.
	
	The problem is not correctable with a BIOS upgrade; Unisys stated that the latest
	BIOS for the Sperry 286 is Sperry BIOS version 1.58f.
