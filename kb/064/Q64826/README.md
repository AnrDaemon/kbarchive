	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet and DeskJet Plus driver included with Windows
	3.0 is incapable of printing out any extended characters above 127 in the
	resident Courier font. This applies to both the ANSI and ASCII character set.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Applications that can remap the font can print these characters as Modern,
	Roman, Roman 10CPI, or Script. Applications that are capable of remapping the
	extended characters are Microsoft Word for Windows, Excel, and Write. Other
	Windows applications such as Cardfile, Calendar, and Notepad are unable to remap
	fonts and are not able to print the extended character set.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This problem
	was corrected and does not occur in Windows 3.0a.
