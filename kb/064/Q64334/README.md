	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The "Microsoft Flight Simulator Information Manual and Flight Handbook" for

	Learjet 25G on Page 48. The manual states that the maximum altitude is 45,000
	feet and the maximum speed is 445 knots.
	
	The correct maximum altitude and the speed for the Gates Learjet 25G is 51,000
	feet and 464 knots. The correct information can be found in Appendix C, Page
	165, of the Flight Simulator manual.
