	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You have an ALR Powerflex computer and you experience either of the following
	symptoms while using Microsoft Windows:
	
	- Your serial mouse has erratic mouse-cursor movement in any of the three modes
	  of Windows.
	
	- Your serial mouse grabs items in Windows, even if you do not press any of the
	  buttons on the mouse.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	These problems occur with some older ALR motherboards.
	
	To determine if a motherboard evision will correct the problem, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Turn the computer off.
	
	2. Take the cover off of the computer.
	
	3. Look near the edges of the green motherboard for a white sticker. This
	  sticker will contain revision letters or numbers (for example, "C-N").
	
	4. Look for a prominent period or a "bullet" (for example, "C-N.OP" or "C-N.").
	
	NOTE: If you do NOT see a period or bullet, contact your local ALR dealer for a
	motherboard revision. If you DO see a period or bullet, a motherboard revision
	is not the solution.
