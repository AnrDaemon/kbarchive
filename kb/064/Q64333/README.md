	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	It has been reported that the middle marker beacon in ILS landing approach in
	Flight Simulator versions 4.00, 4.00a and 4.00b does not emit tones related to
	the marker in the form of dots (short tones) and dashes (long tones).
	
	Normally, the beacons transmit radio beams, straight up, so that the outer,
	middle, and inner marker-light receivers on the plane can pick them up when the
	plane is directly over the beacons. This gives information about the distance to
	runway.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
