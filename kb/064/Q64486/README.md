	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	An IBM EE 1.2 Lan Server can only add User IDs that are a maximum of eight
	characters long. This is an issue only if Microsoft OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.0
	or 2.1 workstations and servers with longer user names will be logging onto the
	IBM EE 1.2 Lan Server domain controller. In this case, the OS/2 LAN Manager user
	names must be no longer than eight characters.
	
	Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 1.20
