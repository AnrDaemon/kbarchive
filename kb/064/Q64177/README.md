## Q64177: Hot Spot Not Displaced Along Horizontal Axis with Driver 7.04

{% raw %}

	Article: Q64177
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 7.04
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | h_menupr menu programming INT33 MF9 | mspl13_basic

	If mouse driver version 7.04 for the Microsoft Mouse is installed
	without the /Y switch, the hot spot will not be displaced along the
	horizontal axis.
	
	This problem will occur only in programs that use mouse function 9 to
	set the hot spot. Including a /Y switch when installing the mouse
	driver will eliminate this problem.
