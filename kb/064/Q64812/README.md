## Q64812: Numeric Keypad &quot;&#42;&quot; Key Doesn't Work in Some MS-DOS Apps

	Article: Q64812

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run a non-Windows application under Microsoft Windows version 3.0, the
	SHIFT key can sometimes be used to enable or disable the NUMLOCK key on the
	numeric keypad. If you use the SHIFT key to enable NUMLOCK, it may not properly
	activate the multiplication (*) key on the numeric keypad in some non-Windows
	applications.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The following two workarounds may resolve this problem:
	
	1. Use the NUMLOCK key instead of the SHIFT key to activate the numeric keypad.
	
	2. Press the SHIFT key while you press any desired key on the numeric keypad,
	  except the asterisk (*) key. For example, press SHIFT+9.
