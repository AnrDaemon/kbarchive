	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When recording a Flight Simulator demo while in multiplayer mode, you must turn
	on the recorder first and then go online and send the aircraft. If two players
	are online and have already sent their aircraft, Flight Simulator will disrupt
	the connection and the two players must reconnect.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
