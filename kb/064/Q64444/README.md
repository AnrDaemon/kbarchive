## Q64444: CTRL Keys Not Functional on Monterey International Keyboard

	Article: Q64444
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The CTRL (Control) keys may not function correctly on the Monterey International
	104 key US keyboard, Model K104, when you use Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This keyboard has three possible settings: a(at), x(xt), and s(standard). If you
	set the keyboard to position "a" and choose "101 or 102 key US and Non-US
	keyboard" in Windows Setup, the CTRL key sends the same ASCII code as the SHIFT
	key.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	A possible workaround is to configure the keyboard as "All AT type keyboards"
	(84-86 keys) in Windows Setup, and place the keyboard selector in position "a."
	Note that this method disables F11 and F12. There may be other undocumented
	compromises to keyboard functionality.
