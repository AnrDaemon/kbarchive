	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you drag a file from File Manager into an open Program Manager window, the
	"do not" pointer (the circle with diagonal slash) may be displayed on the screen
	in Microsoft Windows. This symbol means that the file that is being dragged as
	an icon is not associated with any program.
	
	A data file that is not associated with a program cannot be installed as an icon
	in Program Manager.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To associate the file with a program, do the following:
	
	1. Select the file within File Manager.
	
	2. From the File menu (of File Manager), choose Associate.
	
	3. A dialog box will appear, prompting you for a filename. Type the full name
	  (including the path) of the program that uses this data file. Press the ENTER
	  key or choose OK.
	
	The file is now associated with a program and you can drag it into Program
	Manager.
