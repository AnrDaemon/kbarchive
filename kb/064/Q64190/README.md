	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Windows allows you to run Windows applications that have 256- color
	support built into them; however, the graphics card and the Windows screen
	driver must support 256 colors. Windows applications that do not have 256-color
	support built into them are unable to use the 256-color support of Windows. For
	example, if you are using an application such as Paintbrush and you have only 16
	colors, your 16-color limitation may occur because the graphics card or the
	screen driver only supports 16 colors.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Each Windows application is written to support a maximum number of colors. For
	example, Microsoft Paintbrush supports 256 colors; however, Microsoft PowerPoint
	supports 16.8 million colors.
	
	Color support for Windows applications is determined by the following:
	
	- What the application was written to support.
	
	- What the graphics card supports.
	
	- What the Windows screen driver supports.
