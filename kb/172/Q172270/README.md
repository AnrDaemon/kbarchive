	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Following are the steps required to certify your Visual Basic for Windows
	application with the Microsoft Windows Logo Program.
	
	1. Obtain and sign the following license agreements and submit them on paper
	  along with your product for testing:
	
	   - The Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo license, available by
	     phone/fax service at (425) 635-2222, document #830.
	
	   - VeriTest's testing agreement, available by phone/fax service at (425)
	     635-2222, document #831.
	
	2. The online VeriTest Vendor Questionnaire must be completely filled out. The
	  Vendor Questionnaire can be found on the VeriTest Web site at
	  http://www.veritest.com/mslogos/. The more information you provide in the
	  Vendor Questionnaire the better. You must list exceptions and requests for
	  exemptions here. By filling out the Vendor Questionnaire accurately and
	  completely you will ensure that your product is tested in the shortest amount
	  of time possible. After filling out the Questionnaire, click Submit and you
	  will receive a Tracking Number from VeriTest. We recommend that you write the
	  tracking number on your product disk when you send it in for testing (see the
	  next step).
	
	3. Submit your product to VeriTest. Your submission packet must include the
	  following:
	
	   - Your software product (on floppy disk, or CD-ROM).
	
	   - The results of a pretest that you have run on your product using the
	     Installation Analyzer can be found at:
	
	  http://www.veritest.com/installation_analyzer.htm
	
	     For more information about this requirement, refer to section 4.2.3 of the
	     Logo Requirements.
	
	   - The VeriTest Testing Agreement (submit on paper-please see above).
	
	   - The Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo License Agreement (submit on
	     paper-please see above).
	
	     License Agreement:
	     Your signature on these contracts does not mean that you can start using
	     the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo. It means that you have
	     agreed to the license terms and are awaiting your product's passage of the
	     tests and Microsoft's signing of the license.
	
	     Confidentiality Option:
	     On the Testing Agreement with VeriTest, you are given the option to keep
	     your testing and test results confidential from Microsoft. If you choose
	     this option, upon passing you must sign a release allowing VeriTest to
	     send the results to Microsoft. Only after you sign this release can
	     Microsoft grant you license to use the Logo.
	
	4. You will receive test results from VeriTest within eight business days from
	  the date when your complete application package was received. VeriTest will
	  send both you and Microsoft a copy of the test results.
	
	5. If your product passes testing, VeriTest will then send Microsoft the license
	  agreement that you previously signed and submitted with your product testing
	  to VeriTest.
	
	6. Please read the Windows and Windows NT trademark guidelines (available at
	  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/winlogo/ before using the Logo.
	
	7. Please see http://www.veritest.com/mslogos/ for the current fee schedule. All
	  testing fees are paid to VeriTest, not Microsoft.
	
	8. If your product box is printed before you obtain the license to use the
	  Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo, you may order the Logo sticker
	  from Special Effects, Seattle, WA (an outside vendor) at
	  specialeffex@msn.com. The stickers will be delivered when you receive the
	  license to use the Logo.
	
	9. Microsoft will sign the license agreement and send it to the person
	  designated as the marketing contact in the Vendor Questionnaire that you
	  submitted. At this point, you may download an electronic copy of the Logo
	  artwork kit from a secure web server using the password provided to you by
	  VeriTest. This contains electronic copies of the Logo and Logo usage
	  guidelines.
	
	10. If your company already has product(s) licensed to use the Designed for
	  Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo, Microsoft will send you an update to the
	  license after we receive your positive test results. This update will
	  reflect the addition of the new product(s) to the license. Your signature on
	  this update is required in order to complete the process.
	
	11. The license allows you to use the Logo on packaging, advertising, your Web
	  site, and other promotional materials.
