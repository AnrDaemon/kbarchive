## Q172916: WD97: Nothing Happens When OCR Scanning from Word

	Article: Q172916
	Product(s): Word 97 for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:97
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kb3rdparty winword word97

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use optical character recognition (OCR) software and attempt to scan
	formatted text directly into Microsoft Word, nothing happens.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Prior to Office 97, OCR software bundled with many scanners could scan formatted
	text directly into Word. In Office 97, this may no longer work because the OCR
	software depends on dialogs that were changed substantially in Office 97.
	Therefore, the OCR software is unable to communicate with Office 97 programs.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Your OCR software may work with Microsoft WordPad. If so, scan the text into
	WordPad and save the document in Word for Windows 6.0 format or Rich Text Format
	(RTF), or copy the text to Word 97 using the Clipboard.
