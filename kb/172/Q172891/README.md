	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are connected to MSN, The Microsoft Network, your modem may disconnect
	after 20 minutes if there has been no activity.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the MSN connection settings are configured to
	disconnect a call when the connection is idle for more than 20 minutes.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can change the connection setting so your connection does not terminate. To
	do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. Disconnect from MSN.
	
	2. Right-click the MSN icon on the desktop, and then click Connection Settings.
	
	3. On the Options tab, click the Disconnect if idle for more than 20 minutes
	  check box to clear it.
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can set the number of minutes of idle time after which the modem
	disconnects; 20 minutes is the default value set during MSN Setup.
	
	Note: If you leave your connection open for long periods without any activity you
	will be disconnected. The connection servers now monitor connections for
	"inactivity", this is to insure that all customers have an equal chance to
	connect to the servers.
