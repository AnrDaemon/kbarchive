	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word 97, when you create an appeal brief using the Pleading wizard,
	the only option for Parties Involved is "Appellee vs. Appellant." Word 97 does
	not provide a way to automatically create a brief where the parties involved are
	listed in the reverse order ("Appellant vs. Appellee").
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The option to select Parties Involved and set it to "Appellant vs. Appellee" is
	not available in the Pleading wizard that ships with Microsoft Word 97. It was
	added to the Pleading wizard that ships with Microsoft Word 97, Service Release
	1.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release
	1.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Pleading wizard that ships with Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service
	Release 1, now provides an option for Parties Involved. In addition, you can
	select either "Appellee vs. Appellant" or "Appellant vs. Appellee."
	
	The updated wizard is included in Microsoft Word 97, Service Release 1 and
	Microsoft Office 97, Enterprise Edition. It is not included with the Microsoft
	Office 97 SR-1 Patch.
