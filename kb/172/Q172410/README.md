	- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Macintosh 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you have installed a Power Macintosh upgrade (accelerator) card into your 68K
	Macintosh, the Power Macintosh version of Microsoft Bookshelf may not be
	installed. Instead, the 68K version of Bookshelf may be installed.
	
	Not all installation programs may be able to recognize the change in processors,
	and may obtain the type of processor information from the older (68K) processor
	instead of the newer processor found on the upgrade card. As a result, the
	computer is recognized as being a 68K Macintosh instead of a Power Macintosh.
	
	Accelerator manufacturers implement processor upgrades using a variety of
	methods. One brand/model of accelerator may function correctly with a given
	installation program while another may not.
