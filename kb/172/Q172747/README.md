	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes new or improved features available with the Word 97 Web
	Authoring Tools Update.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Word 97 Web Authoring Tools Update contains new features for working on HTML
	documents in Microsoft Word. With this update, Word can publish your documents
	to a Web server, check for broken hyperlinks, take advantage of new page
	designs, and convert your documents into Web pages more easily.
	
	System Requirements
	-------------------
	
	- Microsoft Word 97
	- Web Page Authoring (HTML) component included with Word 97
	- HTML Converter component included with Word 97
	- Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0
	
	New Features of the Web Authoring Tools Update
	----------------------------------------------
	
	The Web Authoring Tools Update includes the following new features:
	
	- Publish to Web from Within Word
	
	  The Word 97 AutoUpdate release includes the Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard
	  version 1.5. The Web Publishing Wizard helps you transfer files to a Web
	  server provided by an Internet service provider, or to any Web server that
	  supports the FrontPage Server Extensions.
	
	  To publish your Web page, click Publish to the Web on the File menu.
	
	- Check Links
	
	  The Check Links feature checks each hyperlink or linked image in a Word 97
	  HTML document to verify that the target destination exists. Word will prompt
	  you to update any broken links.
	
	- New Templates, Styles, and Backgrounds
	
	  This update includes several new Word templates, styles, and backgrounds.
	  These include a new online Resume template and the Jade, Papyrus, and Rattan
	  backgrounds. You can add these to any existing Web page, or to new Web pages
	  through the Web Page Wizard.
	
	- Improved Conversion Wizard for Web Pages
	
	  This updated version of the Conversion Wizard, a tool that converts multiple
	  files from one format to another, includes new options for converting Word
	  documents to Web page documents. With these new options, you can easily give
	  your converted Web pages a consistent look. For example, when you convert
	  your documents, you can choose to have Word add a background or page
	  elements, such as a title area or navigation links, to the top and bottom of
	  all your Web pages.
	
	- Web Page Preview for Multiple Browsers
	
	  If more than one Web browser is installed on your computer, you can select
	  which one Word uses for the Web Page Preview command.
	
	- Web Page Moving
	
	  If you save an HTML document in a different folder, Word prompts you to repair
	  broken links in your document. This Web Page Moving feature gives you the
	  option to copy linked images to the new folder, update the image path so it
	  points to the new folder, or leave the links as they are.
	
	- Easily Edit Graphics
	
	  If you double-click a picture in an HTML document, Word starts your default
	  image-editing program, such as Microsoft Photo Editor (included on the
	  Microsoft Office 97 CD).

	Authoring Tools Update by using either of the following methods.
