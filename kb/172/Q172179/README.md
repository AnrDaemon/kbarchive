	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you save a text (.txt) file using a Banyan Vines client version 5.56(5)
	with Windows NT 3.51, Microsoft Word stops responding (hangs).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when you open a text file in Word that was created
	previously with Windows Notepad and then re-save the file.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Contact Banyan Vines for the latest client version. As of June 1997, the current
	release of the Banyan client for Windows NT was release 4, version 7.26.
	Microsoft has not tested this version and therefore cannot guarantee its
	results.
