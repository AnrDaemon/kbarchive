	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you ping your Cisco ISDN router, or hosts on the other side of this router,
	you may receive the following error message:
	
	  Request timed out.
	
	This issue may occur from many different client types and may seem to move from
	one client to another.
	
	
	CAUSE

	accept the number of users that are on your network.

	Contact Cisco Systems for information about their licensing packages and how to
	configure them properly for your network.
