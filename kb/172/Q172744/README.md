	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Outline Numbered tab contains eight previews. One of the preview windows
	contains no preview (denoted by the word "None"). Selecting this preview will
	remove any numbering scheme applied to the current selection. The other previews
	allow you to set different customized numbering schemes.
	
	When your insertion point is in a numbered paragraph and you click the Outline
	Numbered tab in the Bullets And Numbering dialog box (click Bullets And
	Numbering on the Format menu), your custom number scheme should be selected but
	it may not appear in the same preview box as it did on the original computer.
	
	When your insertion point is not in a numbered paragraph and you click the
	Outline Numbered tab in the Bullets And Numbering dialog box (click Bullets And
	Numbering on the Format menu), the selected number scheme appears in the
	top-left preview box instead of None and your customized numbering scheme may
	not appear.
	
	For additional information about moving a customized numbering scheme to another
	computer, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q172631 WD97: Custom Numbering Scheme Not Available on Other Computer
	
	The only settings saved in the document from the customized Outline Numbered
	dialog box are the options that are available when you click Customize on the
	Outline Numbered dialog box. Any directly applied formatting may be lost or
	overridden with formats defined in the default List Number styles. This can
	include customized tab settings applied to the original document after the
	custom Outline Numbered list was applied.
	
	For additional information the List number style, please see the following
	article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a document that contains a custom outline number scheme on a
	computer other than the one used when you created the file, the outline number
	scheme may appear in a different preview window on the Outline Numbered tab.
	
	NOTE: To locate the Outline Numbered tab, click Bullets And Numbering from the
	Format menu.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The custom outline number format is saved as a part of the document. Hence, when
	you open the document on another computer, the custom outline number scheme will
	be available.
