	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Microsoft Office 97 for Windows over Microsoft Office for
	Windows 95, you may not be able to use Microsoft Word as your e-mail editor in
	either Microsoft Exchange Client version 4.0, or Microsoft Outlook 97.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur when you install Office 97 over Office 95. If you choose
	to install Office 97 in the same location as Office 95, Office 97 Setup removes
	all Office 95 components automatically.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, start Word and then start your e-mail client (either
	Outlook or Exchange). In your e-mail client, select the option to use Word as
	the e-mail editor. The next time you run both programs, the e- mail client
	should automatically use WordMail to edit mail.
