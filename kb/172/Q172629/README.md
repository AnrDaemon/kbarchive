	Information About Office 97 Web Find Fast
	-----------------------------------------
	
	Web Find Fast allows you to create and maintain index files on Web servers,
	network drives, or shared folders on an intranet. You can also use Web Find Fast
	on an Internet server. Users can then perform full-text searches of the index
	for words, phrases, or properties in Office documents.
	
	Users can run a search from a Web browser on a client computer running Microsoft
	Windows or the Macintosh operating system. Search results are returned in a Web
	page as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) links or File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
	links.
	
	Clicking any link opens the document in the appropriate program. If the user has
	a Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, that supports active
	documents, the Office program runs in the user's Web browser.
	
	Web Find Fast uses indexes created by the Find Fast NT service that runs on the
	Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation operating systems. The server or
	workstation must be configured as an HTTP server (Web server) with Web server
	software, such as Microsoft Internet Information Server. To ensure that you do
	not violate the connection agreement, please refer to your license agreement.
	
	The system requirements for Web Find Fast depend on your need for remote
	administration.
	
	With remote administration, the system requirements are the following:
	
	- Windows NT Server 4.0.
	
	- An NTFS partition for installation of the Administration Tool files (to
	  provide security).
	
	- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0 or later.
	
	Without remote administration, the system requirements are the following:
	
	- Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 with Service Pack
	  (SP) 5
	
	  -or-
	
	- Windows NT version 4.0 Internet Server API (ISAPI)
	
	  -or-
	
	- CGI-compliant Web server software running on one of the Windows NT operating
	  systems.
	
	NOTE: The setup program for Web Find Fast is only available on the Microsoft
	Office 97 Professional Edition for Windows CD-ROM in the Srvpack folder.
