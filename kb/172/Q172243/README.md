	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to sign in to MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive the
	following error message:
	
	  The Member ID or Password is not valid.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The MSN authentication process cannot resolve a Member ID of greater than 40
	characters.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, create a new MSN Member ID with no more than 40
	characters. Because your Member ID provides the only means of identifying your
	account, you must create a new MSN account to obtain a new Member ID. To do so,
	follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	2. In the Open box, type "signup.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then
	  click OK.
	
	3. Follow the instructions on the screen.
	
	After you verify that your new MSN account is working properly, contact MSN
	Customer Service to cancel your old account.
