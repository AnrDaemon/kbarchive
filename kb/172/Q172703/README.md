	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you add a page to your letter so that it includes two or more pages, a page
	number and date are added to the header of your document beginning on page two.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if you used the Letter Wizard, selected either the
	Contemporary, Elegant, or Professional Page design, and cleared the "Include
	header and footer with page design" check box. You cannot add or modify the
	header while running the Letter Wizard.
	
	NOTE: This problem may also occur when you use a custom page design or when you
	use the Letter Wizard to modify an existing letter.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	NOTE: View the document in Page Layout to see the header of your letter.
	
	To remove the page number and date information contained in the header, follow
	these steps:
	
	1. Move the insertion point to page two of your letter.
	
	2. On the View menu, click Header And Footer. The insertion point should now be
	  in the header of your letter.
	
	3. On the Edit menu, click Select All.
	
	4. On the Edit menu, click Cut.
	
	5. Click the Close button on the Header And Footer toolbar.
