	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you modify the number format to include parentheses within a Text Form
	Field Options dialog box, where the type of text form field is set to Number,
	the parentheses do not appear in the form field result.
	
	For example, if you want to format a form field to display a phone number
	formatted as
	
	  (206) 555-1234
	
	using the number format of
	
	  (###) ###-####
	
	the result will be
	
	  2065551234.00
	
	NOTE: This problem also occurs when you open a Word 2000 document in Word 97,
	when the Word 2000 document contains a text form field that uses the same number
	format described in this article.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Currently there is no workaround for this problem. The parentheses must be
	omitted.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
