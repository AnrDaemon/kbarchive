	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Word ships with templates designed for exclusive use with WordMail.
	Each WordMail template contains shortcut-key assignments that have been
	re-assigned to perform different functions from their comparative default
	behavior in Word.
	
	The following is a list of shortcut-key assignments that are re-assigned to work
	with your e-mail editor and their comparative assignments in Word 97.
	
	The default action for the shortcut key within Word is listed under the "Word
	Template, Normal.dot" column as a comparison to the action that occurs in
	Microsoft Outlook 97 using WordMail with one of the provided WordMail
	templates.

	NOTE: Character and paragraph formatting (Bold, Italic, Underline, Paragraph
	alignments, and Font sizes) shortcut-key assignments are the same when used in
	Microsoft Word using the Normal.dot and in Microsoft Outlook when using the
	supplied templates, such as Email.dot. For example, CTRL+B will make the current
	selection bold.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When composing an e-mail message using Word as your e-mail editor in Microsoft
	Outlook and when you use any Word template that is not based on the provided
	WordMail templates, such as Email.dot, using the shortcut keys may produce
	unexpected behavior.
	
	Microsoft Word 97 includes a component called WordMail that allows you to use
	Microsoft Word as your e-mail editor in Microsoft Outlook 97. When you "Enable
	Word as e-mail editor" in Outlook, it will look for templates in the default
	folder, \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office. Microsoft Outlook will use is
	Email.dot as the default template.
	
	The Microsoft Word templates that are designed to be used with Microsoft Outlook
	are as follows:
	
	  Email.dot
	  Hightech.dot
	  Html.dot
	  Midnight.dot
	  Ocean.dot
	  Rain.dot
	  Urgent.dot
