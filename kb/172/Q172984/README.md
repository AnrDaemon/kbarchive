	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to print a document with margins less than one inch and use the
	Texas Instruments TI 850/855 driver, the document will not print. The document
	will spool to the queue and Windows NT will print an informational message in
	the event log that the document has printed.
	
	The printer does not produce any output, even though the system seems to be
	functioning properly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
