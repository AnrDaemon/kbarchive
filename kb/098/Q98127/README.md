	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Sometimes the following error message occurs when you use the Templates and
	Add-in Command on the Tools menu to attach a different template:
	
	  The document template is not valid.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when you attempt to attach a global template or add-in and
	you select a file
	
	- with a .dot file name extension that is in a format other than Word Document
	  Template format.
	
	  -or-
	
	- that is in a format other than Word Document Template format, such as a Word
	  document.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Word, you usually create a new document by basing it on a template. However,
	you can also base a new document on another Word document, but you cannot later
	attach a Word document as a template to an existing Word document.
	
	When you base a new document on an existing Word document, Word inserts the text
	from the existing document in the new document as a boilerplate.
