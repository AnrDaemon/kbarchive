	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Windows Sound System Autodemo is an MS-DOS-based application that displays the
	main features of Windows Sound System through the use of graphics and sound. It
	uses the PC speaker available on most PC systems for sound output. The
	demonstration can be ordered by calling Microsoft Sales Information Center
	(MSIC) at (800) 426-9400 and requesting Windows Sound System Autodemo.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Autodemo runs from MS-DOS as well as from an MS-DOS box under Windows
	running in 386 enhanced mode; however, the quality of the sounds played through
	out the demonstration may be better when run from MS-DOS. To set up Autodemo,
	insert the floppy disk into your floppy disk drive and run the Install program
	by typing
	
	  a:\install
	
	at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER. You can also install Autodemo
	from Windows. From the File menu of Program Manager, choose Run and type:
	
	  a:\setup.exe
	
	Follow the steps on the screen.
	
	To run Autodemo at the MS-DOS command prompt, type
	
	  demo
	
	from the directory in which you installed it (WSSDEMO by default). The
	demonstration works better when run from the MS-DOS command prompt and with at
	least 420K of conventional memory. You cannot adjust the volume on the sounds.
