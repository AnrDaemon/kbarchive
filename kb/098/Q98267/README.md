	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
	- Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Windows Sound System ProofReader utility may not work with
	Microsoft Excel workbook sheets if the sheets have extended filenames greater
	than 20 characters: the ProofReader utility may respond incorrectly or may not
	not have any sound.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	ProofReader can be installed as an option under Microsoft Excel when you install
	the Windows Sound System. This utility allows you to proofread different data
	types that you select.
	
	When you proofread data from selected cells, you may not be able to hear the
	sounds or the ProofReader utility may not respond correctly. However, proofing
	data that you enter seems to work correctly.
	
	Workaround
	----------
	
	To work around this problem, save the sheet with an extended filename of 20
	characters or less.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
