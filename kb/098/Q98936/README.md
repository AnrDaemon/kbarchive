	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Dr. Black Jack is a computerized version of the poker game blackjack. The object
	is to hold two or more cards whose ranks equal either a perfect score of 21, or
	as near to 21 as possible without going over. All play is against the dealer. If
	you get nearer to 21 than the dealer, you win the hand.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The dealer gives each player two cards, both face up. The dealer gives himself
	two cards, one face up and one face down. The uncertainty of blackjack comes
	from not knowing the rank of the dealer's hole card, and from not knowing what
	card you will get if you ask for more cards. Other options for smart play and a
	fun game are to double down, split, or buy insurance.
	
	The game has a scoring system much like a real casino. How much, if anything, did
	you win? The computer compares your session winnings to your previous games and
	lets you know if you set a record. The game records your highest session
	winnings in its Hall of Fame.
	
	For the beginner, the game is designed to give advice on the cards being dealt.
	The advice is based on whether the cards in your hand are hard or soft. The
	advice for a hard hand of cards is more conservative than it is for a soft hand.
	This is logical because a hard hand of cards isn't flexible, while a soft hand
	is. The flexibility is counting the ace as a 1 instead of an 11 if you draw too
	high of a card.
