	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Tic Tac Drop is a computer version of tic tac toe. The objective in Tic Tac Drop
	is to get a select number of balls in a straight line, as you would in a game of
	tic tac toe. Drop one game ball at a time into the top of the column you want.
	Try for a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row as your opponent plots to block
	your every play.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Tic Tac Drop offers more than 150 game configurations. You can customize your
	own boards by choosing the number of columns and rows you want, the shape you
	want them in, and the parameters required to win. You can play against yourself,
	another person, or the computer at three different skill levels.
	
	You can control the complexity of the game by changing the size and shape of the
	grid, the number of balls needed to form a win pattern, the skill level, the
	number of players, and who goes first.
	
	You can also set up Tic Tac Drop to suit your personal preferences. The next time
	you start a game, Tic Tac Drop uses the settings as you last left them.
	
	Tic Tac Drop is a tutor, too. Build the most complex playing grid you can, and
	then choose Demo from the Game menu. Watch as the computer plays against itself
	and learn from the strategies it engages.
