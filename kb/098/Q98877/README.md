	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks may be unable to
	print to some early Apple LaserWriters that contain a ROM version earlier than
	2.0. You may receive "Offending Command" PostScript errors or the print job may
	not be processed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can check the specific ROM version by inspecting the printer start page,
	which prints when you turn on the LaserWriter's power. This page contains the
	name of the printer in its heading and then a series of graphics. The ROM
	version is listed in the lower-left corner of the graphic resembling a line
	chart. If this version is earlier than version 2.0, Microsoft Mail may not print
	correctly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
