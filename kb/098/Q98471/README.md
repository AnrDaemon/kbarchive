	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After you hit the ball in the hole on either the Driving Range or the Chipping
	and Putting Range, the Post Shot Selection window will not have a Continue
	button. The only available buttons are Rehit and Drop.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The lack of a Continue button is by design. To continue practicing, you need to
	click Drop and place the ball in a new position. At that point you can take
	another swing, start a new course, or exit the game (choose the appropriate
	command from the Game Menu).
