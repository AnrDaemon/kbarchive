	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Chip's Challenge is a multilevel maze game. The objective in Chip's Challenge is
	to help heroic Chip find all the computer chips he needs on one level so that he
	can plug into the cosmic computer socket and pass through the exit square to the
	next level. Along the 144 levels, you've got to keep Chip safe from the many
	dangers he may encounter. Using the arrow keys on the numeric keypad or the
	mouse to move Chip, your job is to help him find the tools he'll need to unlock
	doors, walk through fire, bridge water, avoid bombs, and find the correct paths
	to the exit square.
