	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you start Microsoft Golf for Windows, you may receive the following error
	message:
	
	  Microsoft Golf requires a minimum of 16 color graphics
	
	This message will occur if the video display driver for Microsoft Windows is not
	VGA or better.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The packaging for Microsoft Golf for Windows states that Microsoft Golf requires
	a VGA or higher resolution monitor (color and SuperVGA are recommended). The
	packaging neglects to say that Microsoft Golf requires a "Color" VGA resolution
	monitor.
	
	If you have a color VGA or higher-resolution monitor, you can change the current
	display driver to VGA or a higher resolution display driver. To change your
	display driver for Windows:
	
	1. Open Windows Setup (usually found in the Main group).
	
	2. From the Options menu, click Change System Settings.
	
	3. Select VGA or another color display driver that is appropriate for your video
	  card.
	
	If you choose VGA, click Current and click Restart Windows when prompted. If you
	select another display driver, follow the instructions that appear on your
	screen.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Golf version 1.0.
