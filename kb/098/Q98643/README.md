	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If the Paste command is unavailable (dimmed) after you copy an image from
	Microsoft Encarta, you may be experiencing a video driver conflict.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, use any of the following three workarounds:
	
	- If the video driver is from a third party video card manufacturer, verify
	  that it is the latest version of the driver.
	
	- Use an alternate driver supplied by the manufacturer. Check Windows Setup for
	  available video drivers.
	
	- Install the Windows VGA driver.
