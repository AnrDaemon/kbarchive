	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	You can change the color of the font on the calendar in version 1.0 of
	Schedule+ for Windows by using the Colors option of the Control Panel.
	
	Schedule+ uses the Button Shadow color for displaying the last few days of
	the previous month and the first few days of the following month. The days
	of the current month are displayed using the Window Text color set with the
	Colors option of the Control Panel.
	
	When the Button Shadow and Window Text colors are the same, all days on the
	calendar appear in the same color. If you want to use the Month At A Glance
	view, the Button Shadow and Window Text colors should not be to the same
	color.
