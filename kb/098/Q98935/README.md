	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	WordZap is a game of scrambled words. The object of WordZap is to find seven
	words among the scrambled letters before your opponent (human or computer).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The WordZap playing area consists of 8 (EasyZap) or 15 (WordZap) random letters
	and a Word Tray in which you make 3, 4, or 5 letter words.
	
	Each letter can be used once per word at the most, but can be used again in
	subsequent words. You and your opponent (the computer or a friend) race to spell
	words. If both of you spell the same word it is "zapped" (that is, erased from
	both of your Word Trays). The first player to spell seven unique words is the
	winner!
	
	If 25 seconds elapse without either player completing a word, a timeout occurs.
	You will see the clock counting down from 10. The countdown timer will reset if
	either player makes a word before the time reaches 0.
	
	If neither player can find any more words the round is settled as follows: The
	player with the most words found so far is awarded the round. If the number of
	words is tied, the player who used the most letters in those words is the
	winner. If the number of letters is the same, the round is declared a tie.
	
	EasyZap Rules
	-------------
	
	The eight letters can be used in any order. As a word is being spelled, the
	letters move to the word tray. They reappear when the word is accepted.
	
	WordZap Rules
	-------------
	
	Any of the 15 letters can be used first, but each following letter used must be
	next to (above, below, left, or right -- no diagonals) an empty square. As a
	word is being spelled the letters move to the word tray. They reappear when the
	word is accepted.
