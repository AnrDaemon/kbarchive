	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Attempting to move the Voice Pilot dialog box from Windows Sound System with the
	Move command from the Control menu will be unsuccessful unless you press the
	SPACEBAR key first.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Most Windows-based applications will allow the current window to be moved by
	selecting the Move command from the Control menu (the mouse pointer will turn
	into a four-headed arrow) and then dragging the window by its menu bar. However,
	this procedure fails with the Voice Pilot window.
	
	Workarounds
	-----------
	
	Like most Windows-based applications, the Voice Pilot dialog box can be moved by
	dragging the title bar with the mouse or pressing the SPACEBAR key after
	choosing the Move command from the Control menu.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Open or switch to Voice Pilot and choose the Move command from the Control
	  menu.
	
	2. Attempt to move the Voice Pilot dialog box. (It won't move.)
	
	Microsoft is researching the problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
