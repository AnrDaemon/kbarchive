	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Windows 3.0 and 3.0a File Manager does not support formatting 2.8-megabyte (MB)
	floppy disks. To format a 2.8-MB floppy disk, you must use the MS-DOS FORMAT
	command.
	
	Windows 3.1 File Manager does support the formatting of 2.8-MB floppy disks. When
	the File Manager detects a 2.8-MB disk, File Manager displays a 2.8-MB option in
	the Format Disk dialog box.
