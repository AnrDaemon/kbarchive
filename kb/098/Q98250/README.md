	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
	- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In version 3.2 or 3.5 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows and versions 3.0,
	3.2, and 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, there is no way to set a new folder
	default to be top-level.
	
	If a folder is highlighted when selecting the New Folder option on the File menu,
	the new folder will be created as a subfolder of the highlighted folder.
	
	If a message is highlighted or if you are viewing a message when selecting the
	New Folder option on the File menu, your new folder will be created as a
	top-level folder like Inbox, Sent Mail and Wastebasket.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design.
