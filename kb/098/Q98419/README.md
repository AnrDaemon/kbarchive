	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Parity errors (for example, OS/2 = Trap 0002, Windows NT = F002) are often
	blamed on bad machine memory when they actually are caused by other factors.
	
	Many machines showing parity errors don't have bad (as in damaged) memory chips
	in them; instead, they have memory that is being overspeeded, and if you replace
	the suspected chips with chips of the same memory type, the problem is not
	solved. Overspeeded memory becomes unreliable if it is not rated to handle the
	CPU speed that the CPU and system clock are trying to run.
	
	Parity errors also can result from a number of motherboard designs with bus
	controllers that are defective as shipped from the factory. This problem is
	generally limited to the "cheap off-brand clone" motherboards. That's one reason
	they are so cheap: they don't work properly.
	
	Loose-fitting SIMMS can also cause parity errors.
	
	Before setting off on complicated and unnecessary substitutions or repairs, make
	sure you find the true cause of a parity error.
