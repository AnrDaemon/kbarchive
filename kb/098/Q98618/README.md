	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Certain files on the Windows 3.1 disks that ship with the new "User's Guide" for
	Windows 3.1 were modified to update references to the new "User's Guide" and
	reword some phrases for better clarity. The files listed below contained
	references to the older version of the "User's Guide" and "Getting Started"
	manuals. These files were NOT changed substantially. (The changes do not affect
	the performance of Windows 3.1 or its setup.)
