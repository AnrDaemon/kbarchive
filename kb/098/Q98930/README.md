	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Klotski (or Klocki) is the Polish word for blocks. The original game was a small
	wooden board that could be arranged into several puzzles, where the blocks were
	manipulated until a master block was freed. Polish children played this game to
	develop basic strategy skills.
	
	Microsoft Klotski is a challenging computer brain teaser. The object of the game
	is to move the red block out of a case through a single exit and to a corner of
	the screen indicated by indentations. However, to do so you must maneuver other
	blocks of varying shapes and sizes to allow the red block to reach its
	destination.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Klotski, a block can only be moved into any open space where it fits. Blocks
	cannot be moved through the casing, marked in dark blue. Further, only the red
	block can be moved through the exit of the case, marked in light blue.
	
	To Start a New Game
	-------------------
	
	From the Game menu, click Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3, then choose which board
	you want to solve in that level.
	
	To Move a Block
	---------------
	
	Just click the block you want to move and drag it to where you want the block to
	go.
	
	Smaller blocks are easier to maneuver than larger blocks because they don't
	require large amounts of open space. So, you should try to get smaller blocks to
	surround the red block because you can more easily open a path for the red
	block.
