## Q98784: PC WSPlus: Cannot Choose All When Exporting to a Text File

	Article: Q98784
	Product(s): Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 18-DEC-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to export information from Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows to a
	text file, the All option button is not available. Similarly, when you attempt
	to export Schedule+ information in the Schedule+ file format, the only option
	available is All.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you export a file as ASCII text, Schedule+ only allows you to export either
	all information, in the case of the Schedule+ file format, or information from
	one date to another.
	
	The Schedule+ Help file incorrectly implies that you can export any file format
	to a file using either the All or the From option.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
	Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
