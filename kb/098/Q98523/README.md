	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	5th Generation's Direct Access version 5.1 for MS-DOS may generate the following
	error message after you upgrade to MS-DOS 6.0 or later:
	
	  Failed Detection Level 1: Command.com has changed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	According to 5th Generation Technical Support, the Direct Access installation
	must be upgraded to work correctly with MS-DOS 6.0 or later. This procedure
	involves deleting all executable files (.EXEs) from the subdirectory containing
	Direct Access files, clean booting with MS-DOS 6.0 or later, and then
	reinstalling Direct Access by choosing the "Perform update from prior version of
	Direct Access 5.1" option during the Direct Access Setup.
	
	For more information on this procedure, call 5th Generation Technical Support.
	
	The Direct Access Menu version 5.1 is manufactured by 5th Generation, a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	this product's performance or reliability.
