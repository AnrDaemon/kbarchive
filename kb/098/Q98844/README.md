	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Database queries can be made only from LAN Manager workstations (either Windows
	or MS-DOS) running TCP/IP. You also need a specific dbnetlib from Sybase for
	Microsoft TCP/IP stack, which helps send database queries across to the UNIX
	server running Sybase without having to use MS SQL bridge.
