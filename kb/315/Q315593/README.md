	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use either of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, you
	may not hear the expected sounds (beeps) for the marker indicators.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the sound is turned off on the plane's radio stack.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, turn on the sound on the plane's radio stack. To do this,
	follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Views menu, point to Instrument Panel, and then click Radio Stack.
	
	2. On the Radio Stack graphic, click MKR (on the uppermost horizontal band of
	  the radio stack).
	
	  The button should now display a green bar at the bottom.
	
	3. If you no longer want the radio stack to remain visible, repeat step 1.
	
	  When you do this, the radio stack is removed from your current view, but you
	  can still hear the marker indicator beeps.
	
	To learn more about the radio stack, click Help, and then run a search for
	"radio" (without the quotation marks).
