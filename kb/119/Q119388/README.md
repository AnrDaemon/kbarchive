	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When using Autopilot to land in Microsoft Space Simulator, the ship's gear is
	lowered at about 60 kilometers above the planet's surface. No damage will occur
	to the spacecraft.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	It is expected that the landing gear would remain raised until the ship is
	approximately 1 kilometer from the surface to avoid the possibility of
	structural damage. This is a limitation of Microsoft Space Simulator version
	1.0.
