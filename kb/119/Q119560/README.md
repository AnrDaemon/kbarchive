	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In version 3.0b of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks MS-DOS client, you can
	type an external postoffice or gateway address directly in the To or Cc line,
	although some directory traversing is required. This is called one- off
	addressing. You can use one-off addressing by traversing the address lists and
	pressing the INSERT key when the address list you require is displayed.
	
	For example, to use one-off addressing for a PROFS address perform the following
	steps:
	
	1. Select Compose, To.
	
	2. Press the LEFT ARROW key to display the available address lists.
	
	3. Choose PROFS, then choose the Node. The available addresses will be
	  displayed.
	
	  You can now press the INSERT key and type in the VM ID to which you want to
	  send mail.
	
	To use one-off addressing for an external postoffice address, perform the
	following steps:
	
	1. Select Compose, To.
	
	2. Press the LEFT ARROW key to display the available address lists.
	
	3. Choose Postoffice Network List, then choose the network and postoffice. The
	  available addresses will be displayed.
	
	  You can now press the INSERT key and type in the mailbox to which you want to
	  send mail.
