	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1994 edition 
	- Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1991 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Copy button to copy some of the longer movie reviews in
	Cinemania or some of the longer topics in Bookshelf, only a portion of the
	article may be copied to the Windows Clipboard.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Instead of using the Copy button, press either CTRL+INSERT or CTRL+C to copy the
	text. Both keystrokes copy the entire article to the Windows Clipboard.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Copy button in Cinemania 1994 has a size limitation of 32K. A movie review,
	such as "Gone With The Wind," can be larger than 32K, resulting in only part of
	the review being copied when you choose the Copy button. Pressing CTRL+INSERT or
	CTRL+C to copy the text will bypass the Cinemania Copy dialog box and copy
	directly to the Windows Clipboard, capturing all of the text.
