	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print to an Epson EPL-6000, TrueType characters may appear overlapped
	with each other.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
	Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT version
	3.5.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Disabling the downloading of TrueType fonts, and thus printing documents as
	graphics, results in the same problem. Some printers exhibiting the same
	behavior have been resolved with the use of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
	Plus driver.
