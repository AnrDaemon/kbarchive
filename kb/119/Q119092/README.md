	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows 95 does not detect the STB Lightspeed Tseng 4000 W32p PCI video adapter
	as a PCI card; it is placed in the Video section of the registry, not the PCI
	section.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	According to STB, the early revisions of the W32p chip were not strictly PCI
	compatible. As a compatibility measure, the video adapter does not report itself
	as a PCI card. The performance of the video adapter is unaffected.
