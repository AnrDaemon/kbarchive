	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft TCP/IP-32 does not function properly with a DEC 205 (DE205) EtherNet
	network adapter unless the EtherWorks III driver is version 2.77 or later.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Using a driver earlier than version 2.77 functions properly with NetBEUI, but no
	connectivity will be possible with TCP/IP-32 except that the system will be able
	to PING other workstations. An updated driver is available on CompuServe in the
	DECPCI forum (GO DECPCI).
