	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you click Files Or Folders on the Find menu, do a search using a wildcard (an
	asterisk [*] or a question mark [?]), and then save the search, Windows 95
	replaces the wildcard in the filename of the Find File icon with an alternate
	character. The asterisk is replaced by an at symbol (@) and the question mark is
	replaced by an exclamation point (!).
	
	The saved search functions correctly even though the filename is displayed
	incorrectly.
	
	This substitution occurs because the asterisk and question mark wildcards are
	invalid characters for filenames.
