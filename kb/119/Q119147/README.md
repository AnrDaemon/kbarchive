	-------   --------       -----------
	
	S14857    SMILE.EXE      The SMILE.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        article named "Building Component Software with

	                        A key notion in component-based software develop-
	                        ment is that a programmer using an existing
	                        component does not need to understand its inner
	                        workings--just the interfaces it exposes.  Eric
	                        Lang walks you through the process of creating a
