	Article: Q119561

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
	   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer does not include any cross-platform
	support for Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. Although Microsoft Mail for
	AppleTalk Networks includes an electronic form (E-form) solution, it cannot be
	configured to interface with E-forms created using the Electronic Forms
	Designer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Microsoft E-Forms Designer uses Visual Basic as its design environment.
	
	On the Macintosh platform, Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks includes a
	HyperCard-based Forms Designer. While the two E-forms packages allow
	administrators to create E-form solutions on both the Macintosh and Windows
	platforms, they cannot be designed to interact cross-platform.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
	release.
