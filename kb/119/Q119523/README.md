	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are troubleshooting printing problems on a notebook computer, first
	determine whether the computer is connected to a docking station. If the printer
	cable connects to the docking station, the problems may be caused by a poor
	connection between the port and its connector in the docking station, or the
	connector in the docking station may be defective.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A docking station acts as an intermediate device between the notebook computer
	and external devices such as printers, CD players, standard keyboards, and disk
	drives. These devices are permanently connected to the docking station. This
	allows notebook computer users to use these devices, yet quickly mount or
	unmount the computer from them. The computer plugs into the station rather than
	the devices.
	
	When you print from a notebook computer connected to a docking station, you may
	receive garbled output, even when printing from MS-DOS. If you experience this
	problem when your computer is connected to a docking station, do the following
	to correct the problem:
	
	1. Turn off the computer and the printer.
	
	2. Disconnect the printer cable from the docking station and connect it to the
	  appropriate port on the notebook computer.
	
	3. Turn on both the computer and the printer.
	
	4. Print a text file from MS-DOS (for example, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or the
	  SETUP.TXT file from the Windows directory). If this file prints successfully,
	  proceed to step 5; if not, use another printer cable and repeat the test. If
	  the test fails again, take the computer to a service technician to test the
	  port.
	
	5. Continue with the standard Windows printing troubleshooting steps (print from
	  Windows Write, print to a file, and so forth).
