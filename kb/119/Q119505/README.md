	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Although the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) does not specify any
	compatible docking stations for laptop or notebook computers, these devices
	should work correctly with Windows NT.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Because a docking station is really just an extension of the system bus, any
	system that is listed on the Windows NT HCL should function properly under
	Windows NT with the docking station attached.
	
	Please note, however, that adapters installed in a docking station should be
	selected from among those listed in the HCL as compatible, just as with any
	other system.
	
	Additionally, if Windows NT is configured with optional adapters installed in a
	docking station, then is later used away from the docking station, error
	messages may be displayed at startup when Windows NT is unable to locate those
	devices. Aside from these messages, normal operation should be unaffected.
