	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Space Simulator 1.0, if you choose the Set Location option from the
	Location menu and select Launch Pad 39A, you will be placed at an area that does
	not have a launch pad. Selecting Launch Pad 39B places you at a location with
	launch pad facilities.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There is no launch pad at the Launch Pad 39A area. It is intended to be used as
	an Assigned View location when a spacecraft is launching from Launch Pad 39B.
	Space Simulator uses the same location options for the Set Location command and
	the Assigned View.
