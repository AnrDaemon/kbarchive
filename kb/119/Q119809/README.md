	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Only one hemisphere of the planet Mercury has a bitmap surface. The other
	hemisphere is a smooth gray surface.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The planet textures used in Space Simulator are compiled from NASA photographs
	and reference material. The NASA data on Mercury is incomplete, covering only
	one hemisphere of the planet. One hemisphere was therefore intentionally left
	blank, reflecting this lack of data.
