	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Observatory mode, you cannot select a space station or spacecraft as the
	target object.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Space stations and spacecraft are not available as target objects in Observatory
	mode. This behavior is by design. Space stations and spacecraft, unless in an
	extremely low orbit of the observatory location, would be too small to target
	accurately.
