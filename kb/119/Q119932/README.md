	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Stop Velocity command (F4 on the keyboard) does not negate velocity relative
	to the Reference object.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Stop Velocity command stops all velocity relative to the closest physical
	object, not the Reference object. The Stop Velocity command negates both radial
	and tangential velocity. Stopping velocity while in orbit around an object
	causes the spacecraft to fall out of orbit once tangential velocity is negated.
