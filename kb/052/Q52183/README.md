	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are logged in to Microsoft Mail and the Display Flashing Menu Bar Icon
	notification is turned on, choosing another mail server that has no new messages
	waiting does not turn off the flashing icon.
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
	release.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There is more than one way to log out of a Mail account. Logging out by
	selecting another server from the Chooser does not disable the flashing icon
	notification. However, logging out from the Mail desk accessory (DA) by choosing
	Close Mailbox & Sign Out (Close & Sign Out in Mail version 3.00) from
	the Mail menu will disable the flashing icon notification.
