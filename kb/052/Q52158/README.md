	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Word version 4.00, when the Send Mail command on the File menu is
	used, Word automatically creates the temporary file "Word-Mail #X" (where "X" is
	a number) and places it in the System Folder. Once the document is sent to the
	Mail server, the file is automatically deleted. This file is a copy of the
	document being mailed. If Word unexpectedly quits while executing the Send Mail
	command (for example, the Macintosh crashes without letting you exit from Word),
	the "Word-Mail #X" file will remain in the System Folder. This file can be
	opened in Word 4.00. It is not a text file, so all the formatting is retained.
