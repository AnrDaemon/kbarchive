	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you compose a message for posting to a Shared or Group folder, the MS-DOS
	client has the folders listed along with the Global, Postoffice, Gateway, and
	Network address lists. A Shared or Group folder name can be placed in the To
	field for mailing to that folder. However, this option is not available in the
	Windows client.
	
	The "More Information" section describes how to post messages to a Shared or
	Group folder using the MS Mail Client for Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Compose a new message.
	
	2. Leave the To field blank.
	
	3. Fill in the Subject line.
	
	4. Complete the body text.
	
	5. Attach any files necessary.
	
	6. Click Close or press CTRL+F4 to close the message window.
	
	7. Click Yes in response to the dialog box "Do you want to save changes to
	  'subject' in the Inbox?"
	
	8. On the menu bar, click Window, then click New Window. This creates a new
	  window titled "Inbox:2."
	
	9. Click the Private Folders bar to switch to the Shared Folders view.
	
	10. Drag the saved message from the "Inbox - Private Folders" window to the
	  "Shared Folder" window, and drop into the target shared folder.
	
	You cannot create Group folders in the Windows client. You must create them using
	the MS-DOS client. If you have Mail for Windows version 3.0b or later, you can
	access Group folders that were created using the MS-DOS client. However, the
	Group folder will show up under Shared folders for everyone to see, but only
	members of the group will be permitted to access the folder.
	
	Further information on Shared and Group folders is discussed in Chapter 6 of the
	MS-DOS User's Guide.
