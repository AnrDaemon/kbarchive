	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When defining subnet properties for Network Discovery, as follows:
	
	Site Database
	Site Hierarchy
	 <site code>
	   Site Settings
	    Discovery Methods | Network Discovery
	
	the subnets property page displays the subnet address as the subnet name when
	there is no resolvable name. This is the default behavior for subnets that do
	not have names and a name is not required for Network Discovery to work
	correctly.
	
	Additional query words: prodsms subnet network discovery
