	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you perform a silent installation of Outlook 98 to a workstation using the
	Outlook Deployment Kit (ODK), you are prompted to reinstall all or upgrade newer
	items.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You receive this request if Internet Explorer 4.01 is already installed on the
	workstation. To run properly, Outlook 98 requires Internet Explorer 4.01.
	
	If Internet Explorer 4.01 is already installed on the workstation, whether you
	are performing a silent installation or a manual installation, you are prompted
	to reinstall all or upgrade newer items. This is normal behavior and there is no
	way to control this in the ODK.
