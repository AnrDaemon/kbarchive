## Q199935: XWEB: Forms Text Vanishes When Resizing Window in UNIX Netscape

	Article: Q199935

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
	- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
	- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	While you use Netscape version 3.0 or 4.0 on a UNIX client and connect to
	Outlook Web Access, and you enter text into any form (message, meeting, contact,
	appointment, and so on), text entered in the new form disappears when you resize
	the window. After you resize the window, when the window redraws, you lose all
	text that had been entered, and the form is empty.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, use Internet Explorer when you want to add text in
	an Outlook Web Access form. When you use Internet Explorer, the text stays
	intact after a window resize.
