	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view events with the log browser in the Microsoft Exchange Connectivity
	Administrator program, you must use the mouse to double-click on an event to
	bring up the event details. Simply selecting the event and pressing the ENTER
	key as you can in the Windows NT event viewer does not work.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.5.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This limitation is part of the original design of the user interface. A new user
	interface is being considered for future versions of Microsoft Exchange Server.
