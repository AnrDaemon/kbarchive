	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 now includes support for Novell
	NDS and Bindery emulation.
	
	Recently, Novell has introduced its own version of the Internet Protocol TCP/IP.
	Microsoft's Systems Management Server is not designed with network connectivity
	using Novell's version of TCP/IP.
	
	It is not recommended that this protocol be used because Systems Management
	Server systems will become unstable and functionality may be greatly hampered.
	
	Microsoft has not done any testing of TCP/IP other than its own for support and
	use with the Systems Management Server product. Microsoft Systems Management
	Server has not been tested and will not be supported under this configuration.
