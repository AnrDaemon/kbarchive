	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If a delegate copies a calendar locally that is owned by another user, the
	delegate can view details of the calendar owner's private appointments and
	meetings.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Outlook client is designed to filter appointments that are marked private,
	so that only the intended creator or recipient can view a private appointment in
	the calendar. This filtering process prevents delegates from viewing the
	contents of private items that are intended for the original creator or
	recipient only. After a delegate copies the calendar, the Outlook client ignores
	this sensitivity property, and the private items in the calendar are displayed
	for the delegate.
