	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft FrontPage 2002 
	- Microsoft FrontPage 2000 
	- Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you insert a Windows Metafile Format (WMF) image, the image appears larger
	than expected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs if you are using older WMF files. Clip art in Microsoft
	Office 2000, Microsoft FrontPage 2000, Microsoft Office XP, and Microsoft
	FrontPage 2002 use an updated file format.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, resize the image. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Position your mouse pointer over a corner of the image.
	
	2. When the pointer changes to a two-headed arrow pointer, hold down the left
	  mouse button, and drag the mouse pointer toward the center of the image.
	
	3. When the image is the size you want, release the mouse button.
	
	4. Save the page and image.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
