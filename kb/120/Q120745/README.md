	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	At bootup, Windows NT version 3.5 does not initialize the Sony CD-ROM installed
	in a Dell Omniplex computer using the Adaptec AHA2741 (and possibly other) SCSI
	controllers. The operating system continues to run, but CD-ROM audio and video
	are unavailable.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Initialization fails because the device requires too much time to complete an
	operation.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	At this time, the only option is to get another CD-ROM drive.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
