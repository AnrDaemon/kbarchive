	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	System Error XXXXX messages appear in DHCP Manager (where XXXXX is the error
	number) after you perform some actions. For example, a system error appears if
	the database becomes corrupt or an administrator tries to exclude a range of IP
	addresses from the scope when one of the IP addresses in the range is currently
	leased to a DHCP client.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
	Windows NT Server version 3.50. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
