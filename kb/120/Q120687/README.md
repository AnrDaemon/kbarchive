	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article provides a basic outline of some of the resources and terminology
	used in conjunction with the Internet.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Archie
	------
	
	These servers are designed to help users find information on the Internet. The
	Archie system maintains a database with the names of all publicly accessible
	files on hundreds of Internet sites through anonymous connections. The database
	is updated monthly and can be queried by any of the numerous Archie servers
	located throughout the world. Telnet is a common way of hooking into an Archie
	server.
	
	Browser
	-------
	
	A program that works with the hypertext feature in the World Wide Web (WWW).
	Examples include Cello and Mosaic.
	
	FTP
	---
	
	A function of TCP/IP that allows users to retrieve binary and ASCII files from a
	FTP server. You either need an account on the server, or the server must be set
	up to allow anonymous connections.
	
	Gopher
	------
	
	Menu-based system of searching for text and binary files at a number of sites.
	
	Hgopher
	-------
	
	A Windows-based gopher menu utility.
	
	IP Address
	----------
	
	A 32-bit numerical system that designates both the host and network IDs of
	computers on the Internet. Each machine on the Internet must have a unique IP
	address. IP addresses are determined by the needs of the company.
	
	Internet Relay Chat
	-------------------
	
	The equivalent of an online CB radio, with input via the keyboard.
	
	Jughead
	-------
	
	A program that searches a specific gopher site for a specified text string.
	
	Ping
	----
	
	A utility that searches for specific IP addresses. It is used to troubleshoot
	TCP/IP connections and can be used to see if a particular address exists on the
	computer as well as gauge traffic on the network.
	
	PPP
	---
	
	Point-to-Point Protocol. A protocol that allows a machine using a modem to become
	a node on the Internet.
	
	SLIP
	----
	
	Serial Line Internet Protocol. Alternative to PPP. Compressed SLIP is simply a
	faster version.
	
	SMTP
	----
	
	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. An older Internet Mail handler than POP,
	
	POP
	---
	
	Post Office Protocol. An e-mail protocol used to retrieve your mail from an
	Internet provider's machine (when you don't have an Internet connection). It can
	also mean "point of presence." This indicates the availability of a local access
	number to a public data network.
	
	TCP/IP Stack
	------------
	
	The communication program you must use on the Internet. Transmission Control
	Protocol (TCP) separates the data into discrete packets. It is actually
	responsible for guaranteeing delivery. Internet Protocol (IP) does the actual
	sorting and delivery. If you access the Internet through a service provider, the
	service provider are using TCP/IP. If you are using SLIP or PPP access, you must
	be running TCP/IP locally.
	
	Telnet
	------
	
	Terminal emulation program. Emulated DEC100, DEC52, and TTY emulation.
	
	Usenet
	------
	
	A vast collection of messages sorted into individual topics called newsgroups. A
	user subscribes to newsgroups by sending a message to the nearest news site and
	listing the newsgroups he or she wants to obtain. Messages from the newsgroup
	are then posted to the individual's mailbox. Services such as Protal, Delphi,
	and American Online allow users to read newsgroup postings.
	
	Veronica
	--------
	
	A program that searches all the Gophers to find a certain text string. Looks
	either at titles only, or in the text itself.
	
	World Wide Web
	--------------
	
	A hypertext facility that essentially ties the Internet's many resources into a
	searchable web. If a certain word or phrase is highlighted on your screen,
	clicking it takes you to another site, file, or definition linked to that word.
	
	WINSOCK.DLL
	-----------
	
	A program that makes all the diverse Internet tools work with Windows.
