	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article explains how Microsoft is using Microsoft Windows NT systems to
	provide large-scale customer support through the Internet.
	
	HISTORY
	-------
	
	Microsoft first established a public FTP server during the summer of 1993. During
	the first six months of operation, it handled about 280,000 anonymous logons.
	Use of this server increased dramatically as Internet popularity grew, and
	through the first half of 1994 the server was handling 250,000 anonymous logons
	per month and the T1 line (1.5 million bits per second) it used to reach the
	Internet became saturated. Microsoft examined the situation and decided to
	expand the services offered over the Internet.
	
	Microsoft established three new Internet servers--each one an expandable
	multi-processor Windows NT version 3.5 server capable of handling millions of
	requests per month. To ensure adequate bandwidth for customer access to the
	servers, the T1 line was upgraded to a T3 line capable of 45 million bits per
	second.
	
	CURRENT SERVICES
	----------------
	
	The key services being provided are Gopher and World Wide Web.
	
	GOPHER SERVICE
	--------------
	
	Internet Gopher services are available from gopher.microsoft.com on port
	
	1. Gopher is a protocol that facilitates browsing and locating information
	
	over a network. Gopher client and server software for many platforms (including
	Microsoft Windows) is available in the public domain. Microsoft is using public
	domain Gopher server software developed by the European Microsoft Windows NT
	Academic Centre (EMWAC). The server software and more information on its use can
	be found at emwac.ed.ac.uk in the directory pub/gophers.
	
	The Microsoft Gopher server contains over 50,000 Knowledge Base articles complete
	with full text search indexing. Simply click your way through the Knowledge Base
	article menu to a specific product, then select a search menu. Type in a keyword
	and all articles for that product are searched for it. A list of articles
	matching the search word is returned, and clicking on one of the displayed
	titles downloads that article for display. The top-level item "Welcome to the
	Microsoft Gopher Server" has instructions and updated information.
	
	WORLD WIDE WEB SERVICE
	----------------------
	
	HTTP (or HyperText Transfer Protocol) is widely used on the Internet for
	publishing information with links to other items. It is often referred to as a
	HyperMedia service because it allows pointers to different media items: text,
	pictures, sounds, movies, etc. The Microsoft World Wide Web server named,
	www.microsoft.com contains information on the company's products and strategies.
	The home page (or top-level display) on the server also has pointers to
	gopher.microsoft.com, so it makes an ideal entry-point to Internet services at
	Microsoft. Microsoft is using public domain HTTP server software developed by
	the European Microsoft Windows NT Academic Centre (EMWAC). The server software
	and more information on its use can be found at emwac.ed.ac.uk in the directory
	pub/https.
	
	Several public domain HTTP clients are available for many platforms including
	Microsoft Windows. One of the more popular ones, MOSAIC, is a multi-protocol
	browser that allows you to access any of the common Internet services from a GUI
	interface. This means that the client can attach to www.microsoft.com and view
	the homepage, then follow links to information on any of the other servers. Some
	of the links even point to servers elsewhere on the Internet.
	
	
	FOR ASSISTANCE
	--------------
	
	Microsoft cannot provide end user assistance on the use of public domain clients
	to reach our servers. Please consult your client software documentation or
	vendor as needed. We welcome suggestions for content, reports of apparent
	server-end problems, and general comments. Send them to these email addresses:
	
	  Gopher: gopher@microsoft.com
	
	  HTTP: www@microsoft.com
	
	Due to volume, individual email responses usually are not possible. All mail is
	read, but these are not product support aliases.
