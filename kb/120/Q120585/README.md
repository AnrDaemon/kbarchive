	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Golf 2.0 requires at least 12 MB of virtual memory available to run.
	
	For example, on a machine that has 4 MB of RAM, an 8 MB swap file must exist.
	Likewise, if a machine has 8 MB of RAM, a 4 MB swap file must exist.
	
	If a computer has not been set up with a swap file, or if a computer has too
	small of a swap file, a message will appear to inform you that a swap file must
	be present to run Golf.
