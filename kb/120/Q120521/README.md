	SYMPTOMS

	When you remove Windows components using the Windows Setup program, the Windows

	try to bring Windows Setup to the foreground or double- click the Windows Setup
	icon in Task Manager, Windows appears to stop responding (hang). Windows Setup
	may not return control from several minutes.
	
	NOTES:
	
	- This behavior does not occur when you are reinstalling Windows components.
	
	- The screen savers or wallpapers that you selected to remove are indeed
	  removed from the hard disk.
