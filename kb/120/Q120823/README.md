	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There is currently a system policy in the Admin Configuration Tool under the
	Properties for <Username>\Shell\Restrictions section named "Remove Folders
	from Settings on the Start menu." This policy is potentially confusing because
	it is not clear what "Folders" refers to. This policy actually pertains to the
	programs located on the Settings menu. The selections are Control Panel, Fonts,
	Programs, Printers, and Taskbar. The "Remove Folders from Settings on the Start
	menu" policy was implemented to provide a way to remove all the selections from
	the Settings menu except the taskbar.
