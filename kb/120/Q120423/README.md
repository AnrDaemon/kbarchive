	When using the tutorial LOOK.BAT with CA-SuperProject for MS-DOS, a second or
	"ghost" mouse pointer may appear if you move the mouse as the pointer is being
	redrawn. It's more likely to occur if you click the mouse button instead of
	pressing a key to move through the tutorial.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
