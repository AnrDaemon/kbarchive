	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	IMPORTANT: MAIL32AS.EXE, MAIL32AC.EXE, and MAIL32AM.EXE contain READ_1ST.TXT,
	which includes the update policy, pertinent update information, and a list of
	all the files that will be modified. This file also contains instructions on how
	to create the setup disks. Please read this file first.
	
	For Windows clients, you MUST run the Setup program to properly update each
	workstation to version 3.2a. Because of the number of files modified and version
	number consistency issues, it is not sufficient to copy individual .DLL and
	executable files in lieu of running SETUP.EXE. Running the Setup program is the
	only way to ensure each and every file is the latest version.
	
	NOTE: This update has been placed on online services for your convenience. If you
	plan to download this update, please note that it is approximately 5 MB in size.
	Since the download time will be lengthy, the connect charges could be costly.
	
	An extra utility, such as MMFClean, is not shipped with this Update. MMFClean is
	available as MMFUTIL.EXE, a self-extracting file, on the Microsoft Software
	Library (MSL).
