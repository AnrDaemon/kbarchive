	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Pressing the TAB key in Slide or Notes view results in one of three different
	actions, depending on what is initially selected:
	
	1. If an object (or nothing) is selected:
	
	  Pressing TAB selects the next object, following the order in which the objects
	  were created. Pressing SHIFT+TAB selects the previous object.
	
	2. If the cursor is within a bulleted text frame (body text):
	
	  If the cursor is at the beginning of a line, pressing TAB demotes the indent
	  of that line, while pressing SHIFT+TAB promotes the indent.
	
	  At the beginning of a line, pressing CTRL+TAB (or OPTION+TAB on the Macintosh)
	  overrides an indent and inserts a tab, moving the cursor to either the next
	  default or user-defined tab stop. To remove these tabs, press the BACKSPACE
	  key.
	
	  If the cursor is within or at the end of the line, pressing TAB inserts a tab,
	  moving the cursor to either the next default tab or user- defined tab stop.
	
	3. If the cursor is within a text frame created using the Text tool pressing the
	  TAB key inserts a tab, moving the cursor to the next default or user-defined
	  tab stop.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Body text is the only object that has bullets by default. The TAB key is used to
	promote or demote body text, in addition to the Demote and Promote buttons on
	the toolbar.
	
	All other objects, such as the text frames on the notes page, have no bullets by
	default. You can promote or demote unbulleted text on notes pages by clicking
	the Promote and Demote buttons on the toolbar.
	
	If you want to use the TAB key to promote or demote text in the notes pages, you
	must first turn on bullets. You can turn bullets on or off by clicking the
	Bullet button on the toolbar.
