	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you print from Adobe Photoshop, the screen image covered by the Print
	dialog box does not redraw completely if you used the Printer Setup dialog box
	before printing. Under Windows 3.x, the redraw is incomplete only the first time
	the image is printed; under Windows NT 3.5, it is incomplete every time.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Minimize, then restore the image window.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
