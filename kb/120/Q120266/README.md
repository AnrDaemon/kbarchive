	The Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 is based on the S3 chipset and will function using
	Space Simulator's S3 86C911 option; however, the refresh rate must be calibrated
	correctly to do so.
	
	To set the refresh rate for the Fahrenheit 1280, use Orchid's FSCAN.EXE utility
	that comes with the Fahrenheit 1280. For more information about the FSCAN.EXE
	utility and setting refresh rates, consult the Fahrenheit 1280 user's guide.
