	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Space Simulator treats all objects as spherical models, with a diameter
	encompassing the longest dimension. This spherical boundary is important due to
	the different ways in which Space Simulator can measure distance between two
	objects. Space Simulator has three different ways of measuring distance:
	Altitude, Distance, and Radius.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Altitude is a measure of the distance, in meters, between the surface of the
	spherical boundary of your spacecraft and the surface of the spherical boundary
	of the reference object.
	
	NOTE: Objects that appear considerably longer than their width or height (such as
	the Zander Freighter) may report an altitude that does not appear correct.
	
	Distance is a measure of the distance, in meters or light years, between the
	center of the spherical boundary of your spacecraft and the center of the
	spherical boundary of the reference object.
	
	Radius is a measure of the distance, in radii, between the center of the
	spherical boundary of your spacecraft and the center of the spherical boundary
	of the reference object.
