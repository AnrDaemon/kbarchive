	Article: Q120203
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): 1994 edition
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994 edition 
	- Microsoft Bookshelf for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Numbers in some Bookshelf Almanac tables overlap one another, making them
	unreadable. They also print this way. This occurs in both the Macintosh and
	Windows versions.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only workaround is to copy the article and paste it into a spreadsheet or
	word processing application. This allows the table to be correctly printed
	and/or viewed on the screen.

	================
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Open Bookshelf.
	
	2. Select the Almanac.
	
	3. In the Find box, type "Houston" (without the quotation marks).
	
	4. Select Houston, Tex. - Population
	
	5. Select Population Of U.S. Cities
	
	The display of U.S. city population values will be jumbled, with numbers
	overlapping one another, making them unreadable. They will also print this way.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf 1994. This issue was
	fixed with Bookshelf version 1995 and later.
