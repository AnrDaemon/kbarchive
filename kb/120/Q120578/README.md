	Article: Q120578
	Product(s): Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
	Version(s): 3.11

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Duplicate IP addresses are not handled properly by Microsoft TCP/IP-32. A newly
	started computer using an already used IP address will join the network
	successfully without correcting the duplication problem. Communication with
	either of the computers sharing the IP address is not reliable. If the first
	computer using the IP address has Microsoft TCP/IP- 32 or Windows NT 3.5, a
	notification message appears, but no further error handling occurs.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft TCP/IP-32. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
