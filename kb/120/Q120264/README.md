## Q120264: Excessive Flicker on Fast Computers Using 320 x 400 Resolution

	Article: Q120264
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Games
	Version(s): MS-DOS:1.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Space Simulator for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On very fast computer systems (for example, Pentium 90 MHz and above), you may
	experience a rapid screen flicker in Space Simulator when using the 320 x 400
	video resolution mode.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, run Setup from the SPACESIM directory and select a
	higher video resolution (such as, 640 x 400 or 800 x 600).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Because Space Simulator supports a limited number of video cards in 640 x 400 or
	800 x 600 resolution, some computers are forced to use the 320 x 400 video
	resolution. On these systems, you can reduce the amount of flicker by turning on
	as many options as possible in the Options, Preferences menu.
	
	Setting Precision to the highest setting, and selecting complex scenery rendering
	might be enough to eliminate the flicker.
