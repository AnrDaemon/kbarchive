	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run an MS-DOS prompt in a window and press ALT+TAB to switch to another
	application, the title of the application you are switching to remains on the
	screen in the task-switching window after you release the TAB key.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if you press the ALT+TAB key combination immediately after
	pressing the ALT+SPACEBAR key combination without releasing the ALT key between
	the two actions.

	To remove the task-switching window from the screen, you must press the ALT+TAB
	key combination again.
	
	STATUS
