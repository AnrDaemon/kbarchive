	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Logitech Series 9 Mouse is compatible with Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
	However, if you use a Toshiba T-1600 you need to adjust the mouse- scaling speed
	after you install Windows. If you don't adjust the speed, your mouse cursor may
	move off the screen after the slightest movement of the mouse.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To set the mouse-scaling speed to the minimum in the Control Panel, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. From the Program Manager, choose the Main group.
	
	2. Choose Control Panel, then Mouse.
	
	3. Drag the scaling speed bar to the far left (minimum).
	
	This stabilizes the mouse arrow display, reduces the speed, and eliminate the
	loss of the arrow off the screen.
