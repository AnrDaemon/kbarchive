	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The front-end software controlling the Colorado Memory Systems (CMS) tape backup
	does not work when running under Microsoft Windows version 3.0. There is no
	workaround for this problem at this time.
	
	Models of the CMS tape backup cards include the AB-10 and the DJ-10. In addition,
	CMS also manufactures the Tallgrass TG-1140, which is functionally equivalent to
	the CMS Jumbo 120.
