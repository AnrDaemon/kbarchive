	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	At coordinates 17273 north and 5442 east in Microsoft Flight Simulator, it has
	been reported that you will not be able to tune into the Stockton, Linden, and
	Modesto VORs even though you are within range. If you proceed slowly to the far
	east (heading 70) you will notice a quick shift in the scenery, after which you
	will be able to tune in the above mentioned VORs.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
