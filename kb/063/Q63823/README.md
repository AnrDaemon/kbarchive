	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You must check the Presentation Mode box from the Printer Setup menu of Control
	Panel to print in presentation mode on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) PaintJet XL
	printer with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. If the Presentation Mode box is not
	checked, Windows will reset the printer to normal mode, perform its print job,
	then return the printer to presentation mode. This happens even if the switches
	on the printer are set to presentation mode.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To print from presentation mode with Windows 3.0, do the following:
