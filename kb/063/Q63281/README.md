	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The error message
	
	  Unsupported DOS Version
	
	may occur if you try to run Microsoft Windows in enhanced mode on a
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) computer when MS-DOS is being run on the computer instead
	of HP-DOS.
	
	You must be running HP-DOS; running generic MS-DOS on a Hewlett-Packard machine
	is not a supported configuration.
	
	This article applies to Windows 3.0; it does not apply to later versions of
	Windows.

	With most DOS versions, if you are running HP-DOS both the Microsoft and the
	Hewlett-Packard copyrights should appear. If only the Microsoft copyright
	appears, you may be running MS-DOS.
	
	Type the following at the DOS prompt to confirm the version of DOS you are
	running:

	HP-DOS or MS-DOS followed by a version number should appear.
	
	It has been reported that some Hewlett-Packard machines have been packaged with
	the generic version of MS-DOS. In this case, contact the dealer from which the
	computer was purchased to update to HP-DOS.
