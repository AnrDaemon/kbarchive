	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	The wing aspect ratio equation shown on Page 54 of the "Information Manual and
	Flight Handbook" for Flight Simulator version 4.00 is as follows:
	
	                 Wing span
	  Aspect ratio = ---------                (Equation 1)
	                   Chord
	
	In John Anderson's "Introduction to Flight," on Page 193, the aspect ratio is
	given as follows:
	
	                 (Wing span)^2
	  Aspect ratio = -------------            (Equation 2)
	                   Wing area
	
	These two equations are the same. "Chord" is the average width of the wing. "Wing
	area" is the wing span multiplied by the average wing width (A = WL). Thus, the
	wing span from Equation 2 cancels out and Equation 2 reduces to Equation 1. The
	following is the proof:
	
	                 (Wing span)^2
	  Aspect ratio = -------------            (Equation 2)
	                   Wing area
	
	                 (Wing span)(Wing span)
	  Aspect ratio = -----------------------
	                 (Wing span)(Wing width)
	
	                 (Wing span)   Wing span
	  Aspect Ratio = ----------- = ---------  (Equation 1)
	                 (Wing width)     Chord
