## Q63325: Saved Mode Causes Backward Flight in Flight Simulator

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	It has been reported that Flight Simulator version 4.00 can produce a mode that
	causes the plane to fly backward if the following steps are used to create a
	mode. Backward flight will cause all controls (Rudder, Elevator, and Ailerons)
	to react opposite of their normal behavior (Left Rudder will cause the plane to
	turn right, etc.). To correct this problem, reverse the mode heading causing
	backward flight (press 5, A, 4, SPACEBAR) and save the corrected mode (press 1,
	D, 1; then specify a title and press 4, SPACEBAR).
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following assumes that the plane is currently moving forward. To create
	backward flight with a mode, do the following:
	
	1. Pause Flight Simulator (press P).
	
	2. Reverse the heading 180 degrees (press 5, A, 4, SPACEBAR).
	
	3. Create a mode with current environment settings (press 1, D, 1; then specify
	  a title and press 4, SPACEBAR).
	
	To test for backward movement, do the following:
	
	1. Reset the mode (press 1, C, SPACEBAR).
	
	2. Set the control tower to be at your current location (press 5, A, 8,
	  SPACEBAR).
	
	3. Change to a control tower view (press 2, 2, SPACEBAR).
	
	4. Release the pause (press P).
