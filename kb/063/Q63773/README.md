	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	To use a cursor to edit a file in System Configuration Editor (SysEdit) without
	using a mouse, you must first press ALT+TAB to exit the SysEdit program and then
	press ALT+TAB to return to SysEdit.
	
	When you press ALT+TAB to return to SysEdit, the edit cursor is in the active
	window. (SysEdit is not a documented program in the "Microsoft Windows User's
	Guide.")
	
	NOTE: You can use the CTRL+TAB key sequence to change the active window in
	SysEdit, but this does not correct the cursor display problem.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
	This problem was corrected in later versions of Windows.
