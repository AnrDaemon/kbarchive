	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may experience problems reading the text in non-Windows applications running
	under Microsoft Windows version 3.0 on a computer with a monochrome VGA display.
	Although this usually occurs in enhanced mode, it can also happen in real and
	standard modes.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You can correct this problem by adjusting the contrast every time the
	application is used.
	
	A better workaround is to rerun Setup and select "VGA" rather than "VGA with
	Monochrome display." However, this may not always work.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
