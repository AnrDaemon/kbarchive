	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print multiple-page Help files from the Microsoft Windows version 3.0
	Help Engine, the last line of every page contains the same information as the
	first line on the next page. This problem of printing duplicate lines can only
	be seen when printing Help topics that span more than one printed page. This
	problem is independent of the printer that is being used.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this problem in Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
	This problem was corrected and does not occur in later versions of Windows.
