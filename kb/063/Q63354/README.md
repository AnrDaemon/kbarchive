	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you want to use a DOS mouse driver with a Logitech mouse in conjunction with
	Microsoft Windows 3.0, you must use version 4.1 or later of the Logitech DOS
	mouse driver.
	
	Windows 3.0 does not use the DOS mouse driver; it uses its own internal mouse
	driver. However, if you want to use a mouse in DOS applications, a DOS mouse
	driver is necessary.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Logitech version 4.1 driver has the following attributes:
	
	  Driver     Size   Date
	  ------     ----   ----
	
	  MOUSE.COM  19784  10-02-89
	  MOUSE.SYS  19898  10-02-89
	
	Note that since these drivers have the same names as the Microsoft equivalents,
	the Windows version 3.0 Setup program normally replaces them with the new
	Microsoft version 7.04 DOS mouse driver.
	
	NOTE: The Microsoft 7.04 driver should NOT be used. Make sure to use the Logitech
	driver 4.1 or later.
	
	Using the wrong driver may cause loss of mouse operation or pixels to be left on
	the screen when the mouse is moved.
	
	Version 4.1 of the Logitech DOS mouse driver can be obtained from Logitech
	Technical Support or by modem from the Logitech electronic bulletin board
	service.
	
	
	The Logitech products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
	performance or reliability.
