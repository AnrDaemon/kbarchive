	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Page 24 in the "Information Manual and Flight Handbook" for Flight Simulator
	version 4.00 implies that the active window can be zoomed with the mouse by
	clicking on either the left or the right side of the zoom box, depending if zoom
	in or zoom out is desired. This is true for all windows except the map window.
	
	The map window must be zoomed using keyboard techniques. This is done by
	activating the map window, depressing the NUM LOCK key, and then pushing the
	HYPHEN (-) or PLUS (+) key on the main keyboard.
