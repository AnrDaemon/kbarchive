	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the Microsoft Mail Form Designer, the Copy To Read Screen button will not
	transfer a graphic from the Send screen to the Read screen.
	
	To have the same graphic on both the Read screen and the Send screen, do the
	following:
	
	1. Select the Send screen.
	
	2. From the Tools menu, choose the Marquee tool (the Marquee is the first tool
	  in the second row).
	
	3. Select the graphic, making sure that it all fits inside the flashing dotted
	  border of the Marquee.
	
	4. From the Edit menu, choose Copy Picture.
	
	5. Switch to the Read Screen.
	
	6. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Picture. Place the graphic where you want
	  it.
	
	7. Cover the graphic with a graphic overlay field.
	
	8. Compile the Read screen.
