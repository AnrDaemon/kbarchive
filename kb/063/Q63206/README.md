	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some airports listed in the Flight Simulator "Microsoft Flight Simulator:
	Information Manual and Flight Handbook" do not list the correct altitudes when
	using Position Set (5, A). The altitudes from the book can be different enough
	to make the plane crash when it falls to the ground. You can work around this
	problem by setting Crash Detect to Off prior to using the Position Set command.
