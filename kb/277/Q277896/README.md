	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MSNIA members who use MSN Explorer can receive HTTP mail through the MSN
	Explorer e-mail option.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is possible through a behind-the-scenes migration from a POP 3 backend
	(used for MSN mail) to the Hotmail backend (used for MSN Explorer mail). This
	mail is generated on your PC rather than on the e-mail server, which makes it
	faster than Hotmail for viewing and access.
	
	Automatic migration happens with the download or installation of MSN Explorer
	over previously installed MSN software. You will see the following messaging:
	
	  When you upgrade to MSN(r) Explorer, you may notice the following:
	
	- All your new e-mail in MSN Explorer instead of Outlook(r) Express.
	
	- Your old e-mail will remain in Outlook Express.
	
	- Your address book will be moved to MSN Explorer, but will also remain in
	  Outlook Express.
	
	- Your newsgroups will continue to be found in Outlook Express.
	
	Automatic mail migration has the following effects:
	
	- All future mail can be viewed in the MSN Explorer Inbox, making it more
	  convenient. You no longer have to launch Outlook Express to see MSN.com mail.
	
	- Old mail remains on Outlook Express and the Outlook Express Inbox, Drafts,
	  and other folders, are unchanged.
	
	- Newsgroups are found only on Outlook Express.
	
	- The storage space for mail is now 10 MB for MSNIA subscribers and 2MB for
	  non-MSNIA users. Attachment size is increased to 1 MB with version 1.0.
	
	To use Outlook Express or Outlook to access e-mail
	
	1. Open MSN Explorer.
	
	2. In the top right hand corner, click Help & Settings.
	
	3. In the navigation bar under Member Center, click Help.
	
	4. In MSN Help, click Using E-mail, and then click Use Outlook Express or
	  Outlook to access your MSN.com e-mail.
	  Here you will find instructions and links to either:
	   - Set up Outlook Express and MSN Explorer to access your MSN.com mail.
	
	  - Or -
	      - Convert your mail to a POP3 mail system which you can access from Outlook,
	     Outlook Express, or other POP3 mail clients, but not from MSN Explorer
	     mail or Hotmail.
	     Note: Information about converting your mail to a POP3 system has been
	     eliminated from the MSN Explorer Help.
	
	5. Read the options carefully and click Click here in the relevant paragraph to
	  choose either option.
	
	6. If you choose to set up Outlook Express so that you can use this to access
	  your MSN Explorer e-mail, type the name you want to see for this Outlook
	  Express account in the Display Name box, type your MSN.com Member ID in the
	  Member ID box, and then click OK.
	  -Or-
	  If you elect to configure your mail to a POP3 mail system, follow the
	  instructions provided.
	
	7. If after converting to POP3 email you wish to go back to web based email, you
	  will need to delete the user tile from MSN Explorer and add it back to force
	  the migration to web based mail to occur again. Follow these steps:
	  1. Log in to MSN Explorer with the account that you wish to migrate to web
	     based email.
	
	  2. In the top right hand corner, click Help & Settings.
	
	  3. Click My Account.
	
	  4. Click Delete User.
	
	  5. Select the user tile you wish to delete and click the Delete User button.
	
	  6. Click OK when you are warned that you will be logged off. This will log
	     you off and return you to the Welcome page.
	
	  7. Click Add New User.
	
	  8. Choose I already have an account with MSN and follow the instructions.
