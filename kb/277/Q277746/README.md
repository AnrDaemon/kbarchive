	2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Combat

	Mission Builder.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	All of the single missions that are included with Combat Flight Simulator 2 are
	"ace missions" that are based on the actual battles during which ace pilots
	earned their distinguished standing.
	
	A pilot becomes an ace by shooting down another aircraft; this is called an
	air-to-air victory.
