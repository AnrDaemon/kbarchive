	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Windows NT 4.0 on a computer with four gigabytes (GB) of memory, a
	resource conflict may occur and cause an internal network adapter to stop
	working.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows NT 4.0 reserves one additional page mistakenly. When this occurs, a
	resource conflict may be generated.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
