	The following information on type quantifiers is taken from the QuickC
	2.00 README.DOC file, Part 2, "Notes on 'C for Yourself'". The
	following notes refer to specific pages in "C for Yourself".
	
	Page 48   Type Quantifiers
	
	The fourth paragraph in this section is incorrect. A long double value
	is the same size as a double. It contains 8 bytes, not 10. It
	expresses a floating point number with at least 15 digits of
	precision, not 19.
	
	Table 4.1 on Page 49 should also be corrected.
