	When a file consisting of only two underscore characters (__) is
	loaded into the QuickBASIC editor, the "Loading and Parsing" message
	is displayed at the bottom and the machine hangs.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC Versions
	4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, and in the QB.EXE program shipped with
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b. This problem was
	corrected in Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
	Version 7.00 (fixlist7.00).
