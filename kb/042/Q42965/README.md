	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When a real airplane is put into a bank, lift is reduced, causing the plane to
	sink (i.e., lose altitude).
	
	However, when Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00 are put into a bank during
	slow flight (80 knots or less), the plane will climb in a sharp turn, resulting
	in a pitch up and stall.
	
	To counteract this response, apply forward stick (down elevator) by pressing the
	UP ARROW key.
	
	Examples of slow-flight situations are landing approaches and high-altitude
	flying.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
