	- Microsoft Organization Chart for the Macintosh, version 2.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Shadows are not printed when you print an organization chart.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when you select a shadow from the second row of the Shadow
	menu and select the Black And White check box in the Print dialog box. This
	option is selected by default when you print to a black and white printer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you use a shadow on the first, third, or fourth row of the Shadow menu, it is
	printed with the Black And White option on by default.
	
	No matter which shadow you choose, it is printed if you clear the Black And White
	check box in the Print dialog box before you print the presentation.
	
	If you want to use a shadow from the second row of the Shadow menu, and you want
	to print your presentation using the Black And White option, do the following:
	
	1. On the View menu, click Black And White.
	
	2. Go to the slide that contains your chart.
	
	  Note that the shadows do not appear in this view.
	
	3. Right-click the Organization chart object, and then click Black And White on
	  the menu that appears.
	
	4. Click Grayscale or Light Grayscale.
	
	The shadows now appear and print correctly with the Black And White option turned
	on.
