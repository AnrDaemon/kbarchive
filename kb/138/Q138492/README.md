	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The first time you run PowerPoint for Windows 95, "Quick Preview" is run. Quick
	Preview presents an overview of the new features of PowerPoint for Windows 95.
	
	After the first time the Quick Preview is displayed, you start it manually to
	display it again.
	
	You can reset the registry settings so that the Quick Preview will run
	automatically again. You might want to do this if you regularly install software
	for other people, or if you run a PowerPoint training program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To start Quick Preview manually, do the following:
	
	1. Start PowerPoint and open a presentation.
	
	2. Click Answer Wizard on the Help menu.
	
	3. Type the following in the "Type Your Request And Then Press Search" box:
	
	  "What's New?" (without the quotation marks)
	
	The first topic listed will be the PowerPoint Quick Preview.
	
	To reset the Quick Preview so that it starts the next time you run PowerPoint:
	
	1. Put the PowerPoint Disk 1 or the PowerPoint compact disc in one of your
	  drives.
	
	2. Click the Start button and click Run on the Start menu.
	
	3. Type the following in the Open text box
	
	  "<drive letter>:\Setup.exe /y" (without the quotation marks)
	
	  where <drive letter> is the drive into which you inserted PowerPoint
	  Disk 1 or the PowerPoint compact disc.
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	PowerPoint Setup will start as if you are installing PowerPoint for the first
	time. However, after you answer the questions about which components you want to
	install, Setup won't actually copy any files. It will return each PowerPoint
	registry entry back its original state.
