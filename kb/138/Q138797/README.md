	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you adjust the free space on a compressed drive (such as drive C) and Windows
	95 is installed on another drive (such as drive D), the properties for the
	compressed drive may not display the adjusted amount of free space correctly.
	For example, 100 MB of free space is displayed as 100.14 MB, 200 MB is displayed
	as 200.19 MB, 300 MB is displayed as 300.21 MB, and so on.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
