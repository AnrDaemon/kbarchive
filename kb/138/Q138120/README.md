	Undefined Dynalink Error
	------------------------
	If you receive an "undefined dynalink" error, it's likely that a
	program you are running uses an earlier version of QuickTime that
	conflicts with the current version. To resolve this problem, you need
	to delete the QuickTime files from the program's directory. To do
	this, carry out the following procedure:
	1. Restart your computer.
	2. Click the Start button, click Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
	3. In the Named box, type the following:
	  qt*.*, *.qtc
	
	4. Make sure the Look In box specifies your C drive, and then click Find
	  Now.
	5. Delete all the QuickTime files in the program's directory. Be sure NOT
	  to delete any QuickTime files in the \Windows or \Windows\System
	  directories.
	6. Restart your computer.
	
	You can also contact Apple for information about QuickTime version
	2.02.
