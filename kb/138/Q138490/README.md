	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Shadowed text may be printed without shadows when you print your presentation to
	a black and white printer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because in PowerPoint you can specify a black and white
	view for PowerPoint objects. By default, all objects are set to Automatic for
	text objects. By selecting the Automatic option, black text is printed without
	shadows.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To ensure that your shadowed text objects print with shadows, select the
	Grayscale option for the object's black and white view.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To customize the black and white behavior for an object:
	
	1. On the View menu, click Black And White.
	
	2. Select the object you want to customize.
	
	3. Right-click the object, and then click Black And White on the menu that
	  appears.
	
	You now see the list of black and white options for this object.
	
	NOTE: Some printers cannot print text in any color other than black. If you use
	one of these printers, shadowed text prints as doubled black text.
