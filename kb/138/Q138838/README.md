	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the PowerPoint Viewer that comes with Office for Windows 95 or
	PowerPoint for Windows 95 to show a PowerPoint for Windows 95 presentation, the
	slides may look different than if you use PowerPoint to show the same slide
	show.
	
	Only the features that are supported by PowerPoint 4.0 are available when you use
	the Viewer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following list describes the limitations of Viewer:
	
	- Builds are limited to one level of bulleted text in the body text object. Any
	  builds produced using the Animation settings are ignored. The objects that
	  the Animation settings were applied to are visible on the screen all the
	  time.
	
	- Sound effects applied to an object's builds or transitions are ignored.
	
	- Semi-transparent fills are changed to solid colors.
	
	- Textured fills are changed to the default fill color of the current color
	  scheme.
	
	- Features such as Meeting Minder, Slide Navigator, Slide Meter, and Slide
	  Conferencing are not available.
	
	- Interactive settings (creating hot spots with associated actions that play
	  when the hot spot is clicked) are ignored.
	
	The PowerPoint Viewer that ships with the Windows 95 version of Office and
	PowerPoint is essentially the same as the 16-bit version of Viewer that shipped
	with PowerPoint 4.0c. It will run on Windows 95, Windows 3.1, and Windows NT.
	When you show a presentation with Viewer, Viewer translates the presentation to
	PowerPoint 4.0 format. Therefore, only the features that are also supported by
	PowerPoint 4.0 are retained.
	
	NOTE: These changes to the presentation are not saved; so, if you open the
	presentation in PowerPoint for Windows 95, you'll see that the new features are
	retained.
