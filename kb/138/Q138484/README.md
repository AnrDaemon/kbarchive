	On a Windows 95 workstation that is running the Remote Control Agent, WUSER.EXE,
	if you have both an application and Telnet windows open on the desk top and you
	minimize the Telnet window to the Task bar, the maximized application window
	moves to the lower right hand corner of the screen.
	
	If the application window is not maximized when Telnet is minimized to the Task
	bar, the application window moves to the upper left hand corner of the screen.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
