	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Visual FoxPro Language Reference manual does not document the READ EVENTS
	command. This is a new Visual FoxPro command that should have been listed in the
	Language Reference.
	
	This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 3.0b and 5.0 for
	Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Visual FoxPro Help file references READ EVENTS. For more information about
	the READ EVENTS command, search for "READ," and then select the "EVENTS" clause
	in the Visual FoxPro Help menu.
	
	NOTE: In Visual FoxPro 3.0b, search for READ EVENTS in the Visual FoxPro Help
	file.
	
	The READ EVENTS command starts event processing. In particular, READ EVENTS can
	activate a menu system by pausing code execution after a menu is displayed. READ
	EVENTS handles events until a CLEAR EVENTS is issued. For more information about
	FoxPro's event processing, please see the Visual FoxPro Developer's Guide,
	Chapter 4, "Understanding the Event Model."
