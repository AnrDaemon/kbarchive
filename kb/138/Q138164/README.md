	  Internet. Easy downloading instructions are available in the Yearbook
	  Builder's "Add New Months" screen, which guides you step-by-step through
	  the download process. Also, a handy quick reference card is also
	  provided to remind you to update you encyclopedia each month.
	
	Q. How does Microsoft get this updated content?
	
	A. Every day, the Encarta Encyclopedia editorial team monitors events and
	  developments worldwide, looking for news that affects Encarta
	  Encyclopedia's content. The editors summarize and package this
	  information (text and photos) into Encarta Yearbook Builder files, which
	  are then made available to you on a monthly basis as a part of the
	  Yearbook Builder feature in Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.
	
	Q. How does this information work with the CD product?
	
	A. After the monthly Yearbook Builder files are downloaded from the
	  Microsoft Network or the Internet via modem to your PC's hard disk,
	  links are automatically created between the Yearbook Builder updates and
	  their related CD articles, making the information accessible from within
	  your Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.
	
	  These updates can be accessed from two locations. The first is within
	  the Yearbook Builder feature itself, in the Update Browser. The second
	  way you can access these updates is by clicking on the Update icon in an
	  Encarta Encyclopedia article. This icon indicates updated information
	  relating to the article is available.
	
	Q. What if I don't get my Encarta 96 Encyclopedia until January 1996. Do I
	  still get Yearbook Builder files?

	  each month and will remain available to Encarta 96 Encyclopedia
	  subscribers through December 1996. The number of Yearbook Builder
	  installments available the first time you download is dependent on the
	  month you first access the service. If you first use the service in
	  January, you will have five months of Yearbook Builder files - September
	  to January - available for immediate downloading.
	
	Q. How long does downloading these files take and how much hard disk space
	  is required?

	  minutes with a 9600 BPS modem. With 30-40 articles downloaded per month,
	  you will need about 400- 500 KB of hard disk per month or 7.5 MB of hard
	  disk for the full 12 installments.

	  entitles you to 12 installments that will be available from September
	  1995 to August 1996, regardless of when you obtain/receive Encarta 96
	  Encyclopedia or access the Yearbook Builder service. By providing
