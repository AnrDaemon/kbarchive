## Q138250: Updated Ifsmgr.vxd Resolves Problems with Tilde in 8.3 Names

	Article: Q138250

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you create a standard FAT 8.3 filename that includes a tilde (~) in the
	eighth position of the filename, all subsequent 8.3 filenames with the same
	first seven characters are treated as long filenames. This behavior effectively
	changes the filenames for programs that do not use long filenames.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is generated by the parsing routines that Ifsmgr.vxd uses to
	determine that a filename is long and should be aliased to an 8.3 name. The
	problem occurs specifically with 8.3 filenames that have all eight characters of
	the filename filled, with a tilde as the last character.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
	the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
	Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
