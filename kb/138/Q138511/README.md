	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft ClipArt Gallery 2.0 stores categories, descriptions, and thumbnail
	images in a file called Artgalry.cag. You may acquire additional .cag (ClipArt
	database) files from various sources. These sources may include the following:
	
	- Backup or old copies of your Artgalry.cag
	
	- Commercial Clip Art packages
	
	- The Publisher for Windows 95 CD-ROM
	
	- The Popular.cag file from a network installation of PowerPoint 95 or Office
	  95.
	
	You can manually combine the information in an external .cag file with the
	information in your own Artgalry.cag. This prevents you from having to manually
	add each image and type in a description and category.
	
	Microsoft Clip Gallery 3.0 also uses .cag files. The main file is called
	Artgalry.cag and is the same as the file used by ClipArt Gallery 2.0. If you
	acquire additional .cag files, however, these files are not merged with
	Artgalry.cag. They remain separate.
