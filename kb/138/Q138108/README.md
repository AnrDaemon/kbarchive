	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Searching in Visual FoxPro Help under the Size Command (Format Menu) shows the
	options To Fit, To Grid, To Tallest, To Shortest, and so on. The Help topic
	indicates that these size sub-menu commands apply to reports, labels, forms, and
	classes.
	
	Actually the "To Fit" option is only available on the Format, Size menu when in a
	form or form class. It is not available for reports or labels as indicated in
	the Help file.
	
	This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
