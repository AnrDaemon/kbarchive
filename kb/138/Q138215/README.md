	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Button Bar sounds in Julia Child do not play consistently. This includes
	sounds for Contents, Chefs, Recipes, Lessons, Julia's Kitchen, Index, Back and
	Options.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If other digitized sounds are playing in Windows, the Button Bar sounds may not
	interrupt the other sounds, depending on the timing. This behavior is by design,
	and programmed into the multimedia program.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you desire to hear the Button Bar sounds, wait until other digitized sounds
	have finished playing before clicking a button.
