	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In 3D Movie Maker, when you record a path using the plane, and use the UP ARROW
	key and DOWN ARROW key to raise and lower the plane's elevation, the plane
	attempts to orient itself, but instead flips over.
	
	The symptoms may also occur if you are moving an actor up or down when performing
	the "At Rest" or "Fly" actions.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This is by design.
	
	When the plane or actors follow a recorded path, they attempt to orient
	themselves on three axis. This may occur with At Rest and Fly actions for actors
	and during the plane's "At Rest" action.
