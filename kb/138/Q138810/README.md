	- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
	- Microsoft Remote Access Service, version 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The README.TXT file included with the Microsoft Network Client version 3.0
	includes instructions describing how to install Remote Access Service (RAS)
	1.1a. You are instructed to run the file RASCOPY.BAT after installing the
	Network Client software. RASCOPY.BAT will prompt you for RAS 1.1a Disks
	1 and 2, even though there is only one setup disk for RAS 1.1a.
	
	When you are prompted for RAS 1.1a Disk 2, simply press enter on the
	keyboard to continue without removing RAS 1.1a Disk 1. All files needed
	to setup RAS 1.1a are located on Disk 1.
