	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the ALT+TAB key combination to cycle through active programs, the
	order of the displayed programs is consistent with the most recently used
	program being displayed first. However, if you minimize a program and then use
	ALT+TAB to switch between programs, the minimized program appears at the end of
	the switching order.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design to give priority to tasks that are not minimized.
