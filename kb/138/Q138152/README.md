	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to send a fax using Microsoft Fax, you may receive an error message
	stating that no dial tone was detected. However, if you plug a telephone into
	the modem or the phone jack, you hear a dial tone and you can dial out.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can be caused by either of the following conditions:
	
	- The dial tone is not the standard steady tone. The dial tone may not be the
	  standard steady tone due to dial tone changes resulting from an added service
	  on your phone line.
	
	- You are using a cellular phone that requires you to press a button before a
	  dial tone is heard.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use any one of the following methods:
	
	- Listen to your voice messages, or perform the steps required to reset the
	  dial tone to the standard dial tone.
	
	- Press the Dial button on your cellular phone before clicking the Deliver Now
	  command.
	
	- Prevent the modem from waiting for a dial tone. To do so, follow these
	  steps:
	
	  a. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.
	
	  b. Click your modem, and then click Properties.
	
	  c. On the Connection tab, click the "Wait for dial tone before dialing" check
	     box to clear it.
	
	  d. Click OK.
	
	  NOTE: This option is unavailable with the generic Standard modem types.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some telephone companies offer services (such as voice mail) that affect the
	sound of the dial tone. For example, your dial tone may change to a series of
	double beeps to notify you that you have messages waiting. Fax modems do not
	recognize this sound as a dial tone.
