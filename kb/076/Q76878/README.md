	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Setup program for Windows with Multimedia Extensions detects a installed
	version of Windows on your hard drive if one exists. You then have the option of
	updating that version of Windows to include the Windows with Multimedia
	Extensions or create a new directory to install both Windows version 3.0 and the
	Multimedia Extensions.
	
	This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If Setup detects a current Windows directory, it will display the directory
	name. If you want to update that version of Windows to include the Multimedia
	Extensions, then continue with the Setup routine.
	
	If you want to install a separate copy of Windows with the Multimedia Extensions,
	then use the BACKSPACE key to delete the current path and type a new directory
	for Windows with Multimedia Extensions.
