	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Mail for Windows versions 2.1 and 3.0, when you try to delete
	entries in the TO: line in the message composition header, the last recipient
	specified will not be deleted by re-highlighting the recipient's name in the
	address list. This problem occurs regardless of the list used to address mail
	(personal, postoffice, or network).
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can remove the remaining users by pressing CTRL+ENTER to clear the field.
	
	For example:
	
	  TO: Administrator
	      Darla
	      Spanky
	
	Spanky will appear in the TO: line even if specified for removal in the address
	list.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this limitation and will post new information here as
	it becomes available.
