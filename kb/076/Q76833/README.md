	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Once the Search Results window has the focus in any book of Bookshelf for
	Windows, there are no keyboard interface to switch the focus back to the parent
	book window. This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion
	in a future release.
	
	
	Alternate techniques for switching the focus, which overcome this limitation, are
	as follows:
	
	1. Press ALT+SPACEBAR to access the system menu of the search window and close
	  it.
	
	  -or-
	
	2. Press ALT+SPACEBAR to access the system menu of the search window and
	  minimize it. This is not recommended, however, because once the search window
	  has been minimized, it relinquishes the focus to the parent book window, but
	  there is no way for the search window to regain the focus by using the
	  keyboard.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The History window has a similar problem. The focus can be switched from this
	window to the parent book window with the ALT+TAB key combination, but doing so
	will force the history window to become invisible as it will be positioned
	behind the parent book window.
