	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses the built-in stereo power amplifier of the Sound Blaster
	card hardware and how it works with Windows with Multimedia Extensions version
	1.0 and Windows version 3.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Sound Blaster has a built-in amplifier that provides a maximum output of 4
	watts per channel into a 4 ohm load. This is enough to drive an inexpensive set
	of headphones or some "Walkman" style speakers.
	
	And although the output is "stereo," the ONLY thing that is truly stereo on the
	Sound Blaster is the creative music synthesizer (C/MS) chip set (which Windows
	with Multimedia Extensions does not use). All of those interesting sounds played
	in Windows with Multimedia Extensions are mono.
	
	Sound Blaster is manufactured by Creative Labs, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
