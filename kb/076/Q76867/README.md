	The MIDIMAP.CFG file is not a standard profile (.INI) file. This file
	was not meant to be edited directly with a text editor like a standard
	.INI file.
	
	To change the current patch map for the driver, use the MIDI Map
	Editor (in the Control Panel).
	
	Documenting the MIDIMAP.CFG file format was not feasible because of
	the number of combinations, error conditions, and so on, involved.
