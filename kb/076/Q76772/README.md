	GIVING MAXIMUM PRIORITY TO AN APPLICATION
	=========================================
	
	Windows lets you set the specific amount of processing time your
	applications will receive relative to other applications that are
	running.
	
	To ensure that a particular application receives all the processing
	time it needs without interruption, set its Priority Foreground option
	to 10000. With this setting, no background applications will be
	allowed to run unless the foreground application is idle.
	
	See the section entitled "Background and Foreground Priority," in the
	HyperGuide PIF Editor Options for more information about this setting.
	The PIF Editor is part of the Accessories Group in HyperGuide.
