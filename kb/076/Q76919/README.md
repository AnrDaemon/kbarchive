	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Under some circumstances, when table headings copied from the Almanac are pasted
	into a word processing screen, they may be spaced incorrectly so that they
	either run together or are not aligned with the appropriate information. In
	extreme cases, the headings may appear as follows:
	
	  heading1heading2heading3
	
	A temporary solution is to use the destination word processor to format the text
	into a more readable form. Also, the information will copy better if the entire
	topic is copied.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
