	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, graphic images that have hotspots cannot be
	copied to the Windows Clipboard.
	
	Graphics with hotspots are not device independent bitmaps. Because they are not
	in a format that Windows Clipboard can understand they cannot be copied to the
	Windows Clipboard.
	
	Workaround
	----------
	
	Use the Windows ALT+PRINT SCREEN function.
	
	For more information on using the Windows ALT+PRINT SCREEN function, refer to the
	"Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
