	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Some of the CD-ROM drives provided with IBM PS/2s are supplied with
	the IBMCDROM.SYS driver dated 2-7-90. This driver does not work
	correctly with Windows with Multimedia Extensions and the MSCDEX.EXE
	file provided with Windows with Multimedia Extensions. An updated
	IBMCDROM.SYS dated 6-1-90 corrects these problems. This driver can be
	obtained from your IBM dealer or field representative.
	
	Please note that MSCDEX.EXE version 2.2 or later provided with Windows
	with Multimedia Extensions must be used to run Windows with Multimedia
	Extensions.
	
	The IBM products included here are manufactured by a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
	regarding these products' performance or reliability.
