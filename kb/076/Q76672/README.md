	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Logitech, Inc. has confirmed that the Dexxa mouse requires version 5.0 or later
	of the Dexxa mouse driver or version 5.01 or later of the Logitech mouse driver
	to work properly with MS-DOS Shell. The Dexxa mouse is no longer manufactured,
	although support is still available through the Logitech mouse drivers.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Attempting to use earlier versions of the Dexxa mouse drivers with Shell may
	result in an invisible mouse pointer, a distorted mouse pointer, or no mouse
	pointer at all. The names of the Dexxa mouse drivers are MOUSE.COM and
	MOUSE.SYS, which are the same as those used for the Logitech mouse.
	
	For additional information or to receive the updated drivers, contact Logitech
	technical support. The most recent Logitech Mouse drivers are also available
	from Logitech's bulletin board.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
	or reliability.
