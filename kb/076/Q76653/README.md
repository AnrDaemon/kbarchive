	versions 1.0 and 4.0 are available from two sources. Sublogic Corporation
	produces scenery disks for Flight Simulator version 1.0 (the monochrome
	version); contact Sublogic Corporation at (217) 359-8482. Bruce Artwick

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Flight Simulator version 4.0 can load the older monochrome scenery files;
	however, the older scenery files were designed for use in a monochrome program.
	The colors do not display correctly if you use the older disks on a color
	monitor. You may improve the appearance of these older files if you change your
	window setting to monochrome by closing the window and then reopening the window
	while simultaneously holding down the OPTION key. The new scenery disks work
	correctly with Flight Simulator version 4.0.
