	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses the Built-In Game I/O Port feature of the Sound Blaster
	card hardware and how it works with Windows with Multimedia Extensions version
	1.0 and Windows version 3.1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Built-In Game Port is a standard 15-pin D-Sub PC analog joystick adapter
	port. The Sound Blaster allows two joysticks to be connected through this port
	with the aid of a Y-cable (sold separately). Windows with Multimedia Extensions
	can be configured to use this as two normal two-dimensional joysticks or one
	three-dimensional joystick.
	
	The only confusing part is Creative Lab's use of "I/O" for this joystick port.
	Joysticks are INPUT devices only. The only OUTPUT that this port provides is for
	musical instrument digital interface (MIDI).
	
	Sound Blaster is manufactured by Creative Labs, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
