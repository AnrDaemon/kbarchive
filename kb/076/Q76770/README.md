	USING THE SWAPFILE UTILITY
	==========================
	
	Windows 3.0 includes Swapfile, a utility that can dramatically improve
	Windows' performance on some computers when you are running in 386
	enhanced mode. Swapfile turns a portion of hard disk space into
	additional memory. However, Swapfile cannot be used with all hard disk
	drives because of the way some drives interact with MS-DOS.
	
	If you want to run Swapfile, see Chapter 4, "Optimizing Your System,"
	in Introducing Windows with Multimedia.
