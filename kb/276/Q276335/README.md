	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you play in a tournament in Microsoft Casino, you can only continue playing
	if your bankroll is large enough to cover the minimum bet. If your bankroll
	falls below the table minimum bet during a tournament, you must exit the game
	and forfeit the tournament.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In a Caribbean Stud Poker tournament, your bankroll must be at least three times
	as large as the minimum ante, because you need to be able to place a bet that is
	twice the amount of your ante.
