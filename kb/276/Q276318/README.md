	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you plan a route in one of the programs listed at the beginning of this
	article, the route may direct you to travel the wrong direction on a one-way
	street.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions is true:
	
	- The municipality has recently changed the street from a two-way street to a
	  one-way street.
	
	- The map data for the street is incorrect.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, avoid the area surrounding the one-way street. To do
	this:
	
	1. Click the one-way street and drag your pointing device to select all or part
	  of the street.
	
	2. Right-click in the box that you created in step 1, and then click Avoid Area.
	
	3. Recalculate your route to avoid streets located in the area that you
	  configured the program to avoid in step 2.
	
	To submit map feedback and report an incorrect one-way street, click Submit Map
	Feedback on the Tools menu, and then follow the steps in the Feedback Wizard.
	
	NOTE: You may need to connect to the Internet before you submit map feedback.
