	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you set up an Outlook profile that you can use to open another mailbox as
	well as your own personal mailbox, the number of unread messages listed in the
	Inbox may not equal the total number of unread messages that are displayed in
	the folder. For example, the Inbox (or any other folders) of the other mailbox
	may report that you have 10 unread messages, but only five unread messages are
	displayed in that folder.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior occurs if the messages that are sent to the other mailbox are set
	to Private instead of the default setting, which is Normal. This behavior is by
	design.
	
	If you create a profile that logs on to that other mailbox directly, the correct
	number of messages is displayed.
