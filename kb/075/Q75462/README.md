	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Syquest removable hard drives require Always Technologies' driver controller
	BIOS revision 3.33. With BIOS revisions earlier than 3.33, full compatibility
	with Syquest's removable media is not guaranteed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to BIOS revision 3.33, the Syquest utilities package version 2.1 or
	later is required if the Syquest drive will be used as a secondary hard drive.
	Without one of these versions, the Syquest drive will only function as the
	primary or boot drive.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these product's performance
	or reliability.
