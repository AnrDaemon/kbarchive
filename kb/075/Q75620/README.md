	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade contains MS-DOS-aware drivers for MS-NET,
	Microsoft LAN Manager 1.0 and 2.0, Novell NetWare, and other current versions of
	several networks. The LAN Manager files include the minimum you should use on an
	MS-DOS 5.0 machine running LAN Manager. Additional files that could not be
	included because of disk space limitations are available.
	
	As mentioned in the MS-DOS 5.0 README.TXT file, the LAN Manager Supplemental
	Disks can be ordered from the Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800)
	426-9400. (Note: This number is different from the one in README.TXT; that
	number is out of date.)
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The LAN Manager Supplemental Disks are available on two 5.25-inch disks or one
	3.5-inch disk. The files are a superset of the files shipped with the MS-DOS 5
	Upgrade package. For example, several utilities are now able to load LAN Manager
	2.0 services (such as Netpopup, Encrypt, and Messenger) into UMBs on a
	service-by-service basis. The README.TXT file shipped with the disks explains
	how to correctly configure your system.
