	SUMMARY
	=======

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Logitech Cordless Mouse comes either as a serial or PS/2 style mouse and
	adapters are normally included with it. The Windows Logitech serial mouse driver
	does not work with this mouse. There may be a pointer on the screen, but it does
	not respond to movement of the mouse. Another symptom is that there may not be a
	light on the receiver. Normally, this light appears each time the mouse is
	moved.
	
	According to Logitech technical support, the Logitech Mouse installation
	procedure sets up the Windows "Logitech Plus" driver. This driver should work
	with all Logitech mice, including the cordless mouse.
	
	NOTE: If the Logitech Mouse install program is run correctly, the Logitech Plus
	option is the only Logitech Mouse option available.
	
	For more information, contact Logitech technical support.
	
	The Logitech Cordless Mouse is manufactured by Logitech, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
