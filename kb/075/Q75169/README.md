	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	IBM is shipping their own version of the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade called
	PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade. It is currently available from software retailers. This is
	quite different from the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade released by Microsoft.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some of the major differences are as follows:
	
	1. Setup: IBM's Setup works basically the same, with some exceptions to the
	  options available. You cannot install to floppy disks, and you must have IBM
	  PC-DOS installed on the hard drive. Only IBM PC-DOS versions 2.1 to 5.0 are
	  supported. You also must boot from the Upgrade to install.
	
	2. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade has 122-key keyboard support.
	
	3. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade has Icelandic code page support.
	
	4. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade ships with Microsoft Mouse Driver version 7.04.
	
	5. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade includes a utility to convert version 4.0 DOS Shell
	  .MEU files into the current DOSSHELL.INI file.
	
	6. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade does not include DEBUG.EXE and EXE2BIN.EXE. These
	  programs must be purchased separately as part of the IBM Technical Reference.
	
	7. Date and Time of IBM PC-DOS files are 05-09-91 at 12:00p.
	
	8. The "IBM PC-DOS Getting Started" manual recommends using SMARTDRV.SYS as
	  opposed to IBMCACHE.
	
	9. IBM PC-DOS 5.0 Upgrade includes AUTOCONF.EXE, which will make your original
	  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files compatible with DOS 5.0.
	
	The product included here (IBM PC-DOS) is manufactured by vendors independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
