	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	ViaNet, a network system from Western Digital, is incompatible with MS-DOS
	versions 4.x and 5.0. Western Digital no longer supports ViaNet, and has no
	plans to release patches to make the network compatible.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Upon execution of the network file VIANET.EXE, the machine will hang if you are
	running MS-DOS 4.x or 5.0. Western Digital stopped manufacturing ViaNet over a
	year ago, and has acknowledged this incompatibility.
	
	ViaNet is compatible with MS-DOS versions 3.3 and earlier, provided the
	partitions are 32 MB or less.
	
	The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
