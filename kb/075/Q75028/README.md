	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	RPRINTER versions earlier than 1.21 do not work correctly with Windows 3.0.
	RPRINTER version 1.21 is not included with Novell 386 versions 3.11 and earlier
	or Novell 286 versions 2.2 and below. It can be obtained through CompuServe or
	directly from Novell.
	
	To order the RPRINTER utility from Novell, call (800) NETWARE.
	
	- For Novell 286, ask for file PSV121.ZIP.
	
	- For Novell 386, ask for files PSV121.ZIP and PSV121B.ZIP.
	
	To download the files from CompuServe:
	
	1. Connect to CompuServe.
	
	2. Type "go nova" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.
	
	3. For Novell 286 versions, select library number 6 and download PSV121.ZIP.
	
	  For Novell 386 versions, select library 6 and download PSV121.ZIP. Then select
	  library number 7 and download PSV121B.ZIP.
	
	4. After you download the files, you need to use the PKUNZIP.EXE utility to
	  decompress them.
	
	  If you do not have PKUNZIP.EXE, you can download it as follows:
	
	  a. Type "go ibmnew" (without the quotation marks) to go to the IBM New Users
	     Forum.
	
	  b. Type "down" (without the quotation marks) to request that a file be
	     downloaded.
	
	  c. Type "PKZ110.EXE" (without the quotation marks) to download the file.
	
	  d. Select the appropriate transfer protocol.
	
	5. Decompress the files and install them. There should be a file called
	  README.DOC that describes the proper installation procedures.
