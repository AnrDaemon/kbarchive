	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	F-15 Strike Eagle II by Microprose needs LOADFIX to run. To run the program,
	issue the following command:
	
	  LOADFIX F15.COM
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This game has an installation program that creates a batch file to execute the
	game. If the installation program is used, the batch file must be modified to
	include LOADFIX before the executable file, as shown above.
	
	F-15 Strike Eagle II is copy protected. The files can be installed on a hard
	disk, but whenever the game is started, the game requires the program disk to be
	in the drive. This disk acts as a "key" disk.
