	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If Microsoft Windows is started from a menuing system such as Point and Shoot
	version 3.0, you may receive multiple Unrecoverable Application Errors (UAEs) or
	general protection (GP) faults within Windows.
	
	Menu systems such as Point and Shoot are executable files that create a batch
	file and then remove themselves from memory. This creates a shell around the
	Windows environment that may cause problems within Windows.
	
	Microsoft does not recommend or support starting Windows from any type of shell
	program. Microsoft recommends and supports starting Windows at the command
	prompt or from within the AUTOEXEC.BAT file only.
