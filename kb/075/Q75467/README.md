	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Power Nine video driver manufactured by Number Nine Computer Corporation may
	have difficulty installing if the driver disk is a different format size than
	the Windows 3.0 disk.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For example, if the Windows 3.0 installation is started on a 3.5-inch disk, and
	the video driver is on a 5.25-inch disk, the Windows installation will begin
	prompting for 5.25-inch disks after the video driver has been installed. In this
	instance, it will stop while copying the VGASYS.FON file. Pressing the F1 (Help)
	key will generate the message:
	
	  Setup needs to copy a file to your system that does not exist on the disk
	  that is currently in the disk drive. You can either insert the disk Setup
	  needs, or you can type the pathname where the file can be found. The name of
	  the file that Setup is trying to copy will appear in the lower-right corner
	  of your screen when you exit this Help
	
	The Power Nine product included here is manufactured by Number Nine Computer
	Corporation, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
	otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
