	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	OPTune, a software utility manufactured by Gazelle Systems, provides disk
	defragmentation and optimization. In addition, OPTune can mark out bad sectors
	on a disk and contains various commands that are similar to the MS- DOS CHKDSK
	program. OPTune can also change the interleaving on a disk without destroying
	information on the disk.
	
	Gazelle recommends that any disk-caching programs be disabled before running the
	OPTune disk utility.
	
	The following versions of OPTune are recommended with MS-DOS:
	
	  MS-DOS Version            OPTune Version
	  --------------            --------------
