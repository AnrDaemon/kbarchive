## Q75850: Using SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN with Setup Video Problems

	Article: Q75850
	Product(s): Microsoft Disk Operating System
	Version(s): MS-DOS:5.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	On certain machines, Setup can conflict with the video hardware and display a
	partial, scrambled, or condensed screen.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, attempt to print the screen by pressing the
	SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN keys. If the printout shows a readable screen, the Setup
	program can be completed by printing each screen as it appears and following the
	instructions on the printouts.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	On certain machines, it may be necessary to use a key combination other than
	SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN. Possible combinations include CONTROL+PRINT SCREEN or PRINT
	SCREEN by itself. CAUTION: Other key combinations can toggle printer echoing of
	the screen output.
	
	This workaround may not work on some machines because of different PRINT SCREEN
	interrupt handlers or corrupted video memory.
