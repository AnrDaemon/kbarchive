	================
	
	The FrontPage 98b binary patch upgrades FrontPage Editor (fpeditor.exe) and
	FrontPage Explorer (fpexplor.exe) to version 3.0.2.1706. It also updates the
	fp30cutl.dll file. When the fp30cutl.dll file is updated, the date stamp of the
	file is also be updated with the date and time that the patch was run.
	
	You must have a complete version of FrontPage 98 to install the patch. When
	installing the FrontPage 98b patch, a "backup" directory is created. This
	directory stores the pre-existing fpeditor.exe, fpexplor.exe, and fp30cutl.dll
	files.
	
	An uninstall file is also included. This file is called unpatch.bak. You can
	uninstall the patch by doing the following:
	
	1. Locate the unpatch.bak file.
	
	2. Right-click the file, and then click Rename on the menu that appears.
	
	3. Rename the file to unpatch.bat.
	
	4. Double-click the unpatch.bat file to run the uninstall file.
	
	In addition to updating the time stamp for the fp30cutl.dll file, the FrontPage
	98b binary patch updates the fp30db.dll and the fpsplash.dll time stamps.
	However, unlike the fp30cutl.dll file, the fp30db.dll and the fpsplash.dll file
	versions remain the same.
