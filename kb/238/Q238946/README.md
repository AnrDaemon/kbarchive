	When you create an HTML message or HTML post to a public folder and insert a
	picture using an Outlook 98 or Outlook 2000 client, the picture is visible as an
	inserted graphic. When you open the message in Outlook Web Access (OWA), you get
	an icon for a broken link where the picture should be. OWA attaches the picture
	to the message, and you can open the attachment by clicking on the attachment
	link.
	
	STATUS

	version 5.5, SP1 and SP2.
