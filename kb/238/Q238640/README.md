	SUMMARY

	available for you to download. Recently, the "How to Set Up the Microsoft

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This document describes:
	
	- How to make a network installation startup disk.
	
	- How to make an installation disk set and run Setup.
	
	- How to modify the startup disk for NWLink frame types.
	
	- How to modify the startup disk network adapters that are not in the list.

	From the Overview section of the document:
	
	  The Microsoft Windows NT Network Client Administrator tool allows you to
	  create a network installation startup disk. This startup disk allows a
	  computer to start from a floppy disk that contains the basic MS-DOS system
	  files with networking. This allows for an "over-the-network" installation of
	  operating systems on computers that do not currently have an operating system
	  or networking ability.
