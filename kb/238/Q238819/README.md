	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following is the abstract from the white paper:
	
	  Remote management and diagnostics allow a systems administrator to maintain a
	  network of computers from a remote location and to isolate and resolve system
	  problems as they occur, without having to visit the individual desktop. In
	  today's widely-distributed networks, remote management capability is key to
	  efficient systems management and is crucial in any effort to reduce the total
	  cost of ownership.
	
	  Microsoft understands that end-to-end systems management is a huge topic. This
	  white paper does not attempt to cover all aspects of management, but instead
	  describes the remote troubleshooting and diagnostics capabilities of
	  Microsoft Windows NT Server and Windows NT Workstation. This paper discusses
	  tools included in Windows NT 4.0, the Windows NT Resource Kits, and various
	  Microsoft add-on packages, including Microsoft Systems Management Server.
	  Note that this document does not provide extensive procedures for using these
	  tools, but instead describes situations where these tools are used remotely
	  to accomplish specific objectives.
	
	This white paper is available as Ntremote.exe at the following Microsoft Web
	site:
