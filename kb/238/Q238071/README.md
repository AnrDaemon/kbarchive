	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
	relating to the Microsoft Press book Managing the Testing Process, ISBN

	- Page 6: Text Box Missing From Sidebar
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Table of Contents Error
	-----------------------
	
	The Table of Contents states that Chapter 9 starts on page 275. However, it
	actually starts on page 273.
	
	
	Page 6: Text Box Missing From Sidebar
	-------------------------------------
	
	The border is missing from around the sidebar element on page 6. This is
	important to include because it is not immediately clear whether the text
	starting on the next page is a continuation of this sidebar element, or of the
	paragraph before it.
	
	The border should begin just above the heading "Is the White-Box/Black-Box Model
	Wrong?" and end at the bottom of the page, after the line "'All models are
	wrong; some are useful.'"
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
