	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Microsoft Natural Keyboard right-mouse button does not produce the same
	results as clicking the special secondary-mouse button CLICK key.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual SourceSafe
	5.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Microsoft Natural Keyboard has a special key built into the keyboard that
	produces the same behavior as clicking the right-mouse button. In Visual
	SourceSafe, pressing the right-mouse button causes various context sensitive
	menus to appear. However, pressing the special secondary-mouse CLICK key on the
	Microsoft Natural Keyboard does not invoke the context sensitive menus in Visual
	SourceSafe.
