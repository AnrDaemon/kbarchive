	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Mastering Exchange Development, the last two dialog boxes in
	the install process appear slightly too short for the title. Specifically, the
	last "t" in the word Development is partially obscured. The two dialogs are the
	Registering Components Dialog and the Installation complete dialog.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This occurs when the screen resolution is set to 800x600 or higher.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Changing to a screen resolution of 640x480 corrects this and allows all the text
	to be seen normally.
	
	For more information about how to this task in Windows, see your Windows printed
