	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to perform an operation in one of the programs listed at the top of
	this article that involves using the Internet, nothing happens (the button
	depresses and releases), or you receive an error message similar to the
	following:
	
	  Internet Config is not properly installed. Please launch Internet Config and
	  ensure that you have a valid helper application selected for this Internet
	  resource type.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Your HTTP Helper application is not selected properly in Internet Config.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use Internet Config to select your HTTP Helper application. To select the helper
	application, do the following:
	
	1. Open the Bookshelf 1996-97 (or one of the other products listed above) folder
	  on your hard drive.
	
	  NOTE: Internet Config may have a folder of its own on your hard drive. If that
	  is the case, open its folder.
	
	2. Double-click the Internet Config application icon.
	
	3. On the Window menu, click Helpers.
	
	4. Select the HTTP icon, and then click Change.
	
	5. Click Choose Helper.
	
	6. Navigate to the location of the HTTP application.
	
	  NOTE: If you are using Internet Explorer, this is either in its own folder
	  (with version number), or in the Bookshelf 1996-97 folder on the hard drive.
	
	7. Select the application, and then click Open.
	
	8. Click OK.
	
	9. On the File menu, click Quit. Save the changes.
	
	You should now be able to open your Web browser from your program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
