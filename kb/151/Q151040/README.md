	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use the Copy Web command to add a Web to an existing Web, any files in
	the destination Web with the same name as files in the Web being copied will be
	replaced.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To prevent files from being overwritten, change any duplicate file names in the
	Web being copied before you use the Copy Web command.
