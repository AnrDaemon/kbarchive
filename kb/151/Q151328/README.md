	- Problem running Setup from a Novell Server. This only occurs with Windows 95
	  or Windows NT client machines.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Yearbook Builder Fix
	--------------------
	
	This corrects an incorrect Registry problem if you chose the "Slow" execution
	option when you set up Encarta 96 Encyclopedia and you download and integrate an
	Encarta Yearbook Builder file. This problem does not occur with Windows 3.1
	because it does not use the Registry.
	
	The specific symptoms are:
	
	- The Yearbook Builder article updates cannot be seen in the Yearbook Builder
	  browser.
	
	- The icon that indicates an article has been updated does not appear.
	
	You do not need the Encarta 96a compact disc to solve this problem. You can
	download Enc96fix.exe, which solves the problem. Instructions and more
	information are on the Microsoft World Wide Web site Encarta Yearbook Builder
	Troubleshooting page
	
	  (http://www.microsoft.com/encarta).
	
	Problem Running Setup From a Novell Server
	------------------------------------------
	
	This problem does not occur with Windows 3.1 client machines, but only with
	operating systems that support mixed-case filenames, such as Windows 95 or
	Windows NT. The Encarta 96 compact disc has mixed-case filenames, which some
	configurations of Novell server software can not read. This was fixed in Encarta
	96a.
	
	The specific symptom is an error message:
	
	  cannot find Enc9632.exe or Encarapi32.dll.
	
	If you have this problem, you can obtain the updated compact disc by calling the
	Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400.
	
	Encarta 96 CD Disk Assembly Numbers
	-----------------------------------
	
	Use the following numbers to identify your version of Encarta. These numbers are
	printed directly on the compact disc:
	
	- Encarta Encyclopedia 1996           196-056-001
	                                      196-056-002
	
	- Encarta Encyclopedia 1996a          196-056-008
