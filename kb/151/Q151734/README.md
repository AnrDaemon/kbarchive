	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you complete Pan for Gold and Stop the Lava in Magic School Bus Explores
	Inside the Earth (MSB Earth), a high score dialog box may display.
	
	Your only option is to view the list of scores, then press ENTER to return to the
	game.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are two games in MSB Earth that keep score: Pan for Gold and Stop the
	Lava. They are not designed for keyboard input when the high score dialog
	appears.
	
	The current score appears next to the name you selected in the rock hound license
	when you entered the bus. If you didn't enter a name in your rock hound license,
	the current score appears next to a blank line. You cannot enter information
	into this blank line.
