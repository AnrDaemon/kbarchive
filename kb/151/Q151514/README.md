	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	With various Microsoft multimedia programs, you may notice that the compact disc
	may vibrate in the CD-ROM drive or cause a humming sound when you run the
	application. This problem can potentially occur with any product that is
	released on CD-ROM, regardless of the title or manufacturer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is an industry wide problem known as "disc unbalance". As CD-ROM drives are
	getting faster, the balance of the disc is becoming extremely important. There
	are several potential causes of unbalanced discs:
	
	- The disc may not be sufficiently flat due to the molding process.
	
	- Unbalanced weight distribution of ink applied in the design of the label or
	  silkscreen on the front of the disc.
	
	- Any seal or sticker placed on the disc after manufacturing.
	
	This problem appears to be random and is most common on the high-speed compact
	disc drives(i.e., 6X and faster speed CD-ROM drives).
