	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the Find By Symptom feature of Microsoft Pregnancy and Child Care,
	the suggested reading list often depends on the order in which you select
	symptoms.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Two parents investigating the same set of symptoms could be given different
	suggested reading lists if one parent selected one symptom first and the other
	parent selected another symptom first.
	
	For example, a child has the symptoms of blood in their stool and fever. If you
	click "Blood in stool" first, you are given a suggested reading list of
	Constipation, Diarrhea, Food Poisoning, and Your Baby's Bowel Movements.
	However, if you click "Fever" first, and you then answer the following series of
	questions, including Yes for "Blood in stool", the only suggested reading you
	are given is Diarrhea (under the category of Gastroenteritis).
