	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Fury 3 for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If the Microsoft Fury3 icon is double-clicked on twice in rapid succession,
	Fury3 may launch two instances of the program. This will result in significant
	performance degradation, and many error messages.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If two instances of Fury3 are running, close one instance of the program. There
	is no need to quit both instances and re-launch the program. This should cause
	the error messages caused my multiple instances of Fury3 running simultaneously
	to cease.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Because of the short lag between double-clicking on the Fury3 program icon and
	the launching of the program, some users may occasionally double-click the
	program icon twice, resulting in Fury3 being launched twice. The
	memory-intensive nature of the program is likely to cause significant
	performance degradation, and the errors:
	
	  Invalid Page Fault
	
	  and
	
	  Insufficient memory
