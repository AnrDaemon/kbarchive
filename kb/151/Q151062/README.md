	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article provides information about upgrading existing operating systems to
	Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Upgrading  MS-DOS, PC-DOS, or OEM-DOS versions
	----------------------------------------------
	
	You must be running MS-DOS, PC-DOS, or OEM-DOS version 3.1 or later to
	successfully install the Windows 95 Upgrade.
	
	Upgrading Microsoft or OEM Windows or Windows for Workgroup Versions
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	With the Windows 95 Upgrade you can upgrade Microsoft or OEM Windows version 3.0
	or later or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or later to Windows 95.
	
	Upgrading an Existing Installation of Windows 95
	------------------------------------------------
	
	After you have upgraded an installation of Windows version 3.0 or later or
	Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or later to Windows 95, the Windows 95
	Upgrade can be installed over an existing installation of Windows 95. This
	process is frequently performed as a troubleshooting step to ensure that no
	Windows 95 files are missing or damaged.
	
	To install Windows 95 over an existing installation of Windows 95, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Insert the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, or insert Windows 95 disk 1
	  in the floppy disk drive.
	
	2. Click the Start button, and then click Run.
	
	3. In the Open box, type "<drive>:\setup.exe" (without the quotation
	  marks) where <drive> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive or floppy
	  disk drive, and then click OK.
	
	If you cannot start the Windows 95 graphical user interface (GUI), follow these
	steps to install Windows 95 from the command prompt:
	
	1. Insert the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, or insert Windows 95 disk 1
	  in the floppy disk drive.
	
	2. Change to the CD-ROM or floppy disk drive, type "setup" (without the
	  quotation marks), and then press ENTER.
	
	Installing the Windows 95 Upgrade on a New Hard Disk
	----------------------------------------------------
	
	The Windows 95 Upgrade does not include a bootable floppy disk. To install
	Windows 95 on a new hard disk, you must use MS-DOS, PC-DOS, or OEM-DOS version
	3.1 or later to format the hard disk and make the hard disk bootable. After
	booting from the hard disk, run Setup from the Windows 95 CD-ROM or disks. If
	Windows 95 Setup is unable to detect an existing installation of Windows or
	Windows for Workgroups on the hard disk, it prompts you to insert disk 1 of the
	Windows or Windows for Workgroups disks. Insert Windows or Windows for
	Workgroups disk 1 in the floppy disk drive, press ENTER, and continue with Setup
	normally.
