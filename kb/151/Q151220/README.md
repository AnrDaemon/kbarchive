	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Schedule + 7.0 on a MS Mail 3.x Post Office, user's with
	a delegate will not appear in the To: line of the Meeting Request received by
	all other invitees.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The user will receive a meeting request, however, the user and their delegate
	will appear in the To: line and no other invitees will be displayed. It appears
	to them as if they were the only users invited to the meeting.
	
	As an example, let's say you have six users; A,B,C,D,E, and F. User F is a
	delegate for User E. User A sends a meeting request to Users B, C,D, and E.
	Users B, C, and D will receive a Meeting Request that displays Users B, C, and D
	on the To: line. User E will receive the Meeting Request with Users E and F on
	the To: line.
	
	This behavior is by design.
