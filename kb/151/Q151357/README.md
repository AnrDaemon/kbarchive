## Q151357: Commit Changes Button Always Highlighted in Disk Administrator

	Article: Q151357
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 3.5,3.51
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 20-FEB-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you make changes to the hard disk with the Disk Administrator, the Commit
	Changes option on the Partition menu is highlighted. Selecting this option seems
	to do nothing but the option remains highlighted.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is caused by creating an extend partition on a volume. After you commit the
	changes, the Commit Changes option stays highlighted throughout this instance of
	Disk Administrator. The problem is only cosmetic and will not cause any harm to
	your disk. You can still make other changes to the hard disks and you can commit
	them properly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
	3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
