	The .avi video file that starts each level skips to the end if focus is taken
	off the window. This behavior is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you want to view the .avi file without restarting the level, you can run the
	file from the compact disc in the Fury3\System\Story folder.
