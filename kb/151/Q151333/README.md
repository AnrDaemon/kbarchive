	The information in this article applies to:

	- Microsoft Cinemania for Macintosh, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 editions 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot use the Bookshelf Quickshelf menu to look up words in Cinemania.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you use the All Books Find command on the Quickshelf menu you receive
	results that vary with the edition of Cinemania you are using.
	
	Cinemania 94
	------------
	
	If you attempt to look up a word from Cinemania, 1994 edition, Bookshelf will
	look up the word for you. However, When you try to return to Cinemania, you will
	receive the following error message: Could not locate the Cinemania '94 CD-ROM.
	Please insert the disk and try again. Click Quit button to close the error
	message. Then, restart Cinemania.
	
	Cinemania 95 & 97
	-----------------
	
	Quickshelf starts Bookshelf correctly. However, Bookshelf searches for an article
	that contains the Cinemania subject, rather than searching for the highlighted
	word.
	
	For example, if you look up the word "elaborate" from the 1001 Arabian Nights
	entry of Cinemania 95, Bookshelf searches for "1001 Arabian Nights," instead.
	
	Cinemania 96
	------------
	
	If you attempt to look up a word from Cinemania, you receive a message telling
	you to swap the compact discs. However, Bookshelf does not look up the word.
