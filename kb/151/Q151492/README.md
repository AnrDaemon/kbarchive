	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you attempt to print from a Windows NT computer to an Apple LaserWriter Pro
	810 using the TCP/IP protocol, the print job may appear in the queue, but it
	does not print. The job must be deleted manually. The printer will also have to
	be reset in order for it to work with Macintosh clients. The Windows NT computer
	can ping the printer and the printer works when printing directly from a
	Macintosh client.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To print from a Windows NT server or workstation to an Apple LaserWriter Pro 810
	using the TCP/IP protocol, an updated ROM is required for the printer.
