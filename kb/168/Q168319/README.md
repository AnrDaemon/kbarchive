	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view properties of the public information store, the Instances tab may
	be missing.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when Exchange Server is installed using the Standard
	Edition and there is no replication to other servers. After the Connector disk
	is installed to enable replication, the Instances tab is available. In addition,
	another alternative is to install the Enterprise version of Exchange Server.
