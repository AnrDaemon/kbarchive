	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you enter text in a document, Word automatically formats the text with the
	Body Text style when the following conditions are true:
	
	- The paragraph ends with a period, question mark, exclamation point, or
	  colon.
	
	  -and-
	
	- The paragraph either spans more than one line or shares all major types of
	  formatting with a previously defined body text paragraph.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Microsoft Word, styles, such as the Body Text style, define the appearance of
	various text elements of your document, such as headings, captions, and body
	text. When you apply a style to a paragraph or word, you can apply a whole group
	of character or paragraph formats or both in one simple operation. When you want
	to change the formatting of all the text of a particular element at once, you
	just change the style that is applied to that element. Styles make formatting
	your document easier. Additionally, they serve as building blocks for outlines
	and tables of contents
	
	Microsoft Word 97 has a new feature that automatically creates styles, such as
	the Body Text style, as you type,. To find out more information about how this
	new feature works, click the Office Assistant, type "How do you automatically
	create a style," click Search, and then click the "Turn off Automatic style
	definitions" topic.
	
	NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
	Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
