	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you insert an AutoText entry that contains a field, the field result is
	automatically updated.
	
	For example, if you insert an AutoText entry that contains a date field, the
	current system date is inserted rather than the date that the AutoText entry was
	created.
	
	NOTE: This behavior is different from previous versions of Word.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design. Word automatically updates the results of fields
	when they are inserted as part of an AutoText entry.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In earlier versions of Word, when you insert an AutoText entry that contains a
	field, the result of the field is not updated automatically. To update the field
	in the AutoText entry of an earlier version of Word, you must force Word to
	update by selecting the field and pressing F9, by changing views, by printing
	the file, or by using a macro.
