## Q168452: XGEN: MIME Type Tab Not in IMC Property Page

	Article: Q168452

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The MIME Type tab in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program allows
	an administrator to create, edit, or remove a MIME type. In Microsoft Exchange
	Server 4.0, the MIME Type tab is a part of the Internet Mail Connector property
	pages; in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, the MIME Type tab is a part of
	Protocols property pages.
	
	However, the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Online documentation (Books Online)
	still points to the Internet Mail Connector properties for the MIME Type tab.
	This is incorrect.
