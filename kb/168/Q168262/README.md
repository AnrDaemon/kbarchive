	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Priv.edb and Pub.edb date stamps may reflect an older date stamp than the
	current date.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Priv.edb and Pub.edb files reflect the date stamp of last successful startup
	of the Information Store service in Control Panel Services.
	
	This is an anomaly of the file system and does not mean that the files are not
	being updated.
