	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Any user who wants to access information on a computer running Microsoft
	Exchange Server requires a Client Access License (CAL) for Exchange. However,
	not all users of Microsoft Exchange clients require a Windows NT Server Client
	Access License (CAL).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	How to determine if you need a Windows NT Server CAL.
	
	If your client uses Windows NT Server for any of these basic networking features,
	a Windows NT Server CAL is required:
	
	  File Sharing
	  Printer Sharing
	  Remote Access Services
	  Mac Services
	
	If your Exchange Client user is not using any of the above networking features of
	Windows NT Server, a Windows NT Server CAL is not required. If you use Windows
	NT Server strictly as an application server (that is, just to run Exchange) does
	not require a Windows NT Server CAL.
	
	For additional information on Windows NT Server Client Access Licenses, please
	see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
