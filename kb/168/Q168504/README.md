	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The "Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide," on page 579 of the
	section on "Creating a Message Archive," states:
	
	  When minimum logging is set for Message Archival no messages are
	  archived.
	
	This is incorrect. Turning off message archival can only be accomplished by
	setting the logging for Message Archival to none. This is a documentation error.
