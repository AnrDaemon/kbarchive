	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you activate a remote control session where the Visible Signal option is
	enabled on the client (under Help Desk Options), the "Being Accessed By" window
	shows the computer name of the system that initiated the remote control
	session.
	
	If cryptic machine names are used on a network, it is not always clear who is
	remote controlling the Systems Management Server client. If the administrator's
	user name was displayed instead, it would eliminate much of the ambiguity.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
