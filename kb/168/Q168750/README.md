	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes an easy way to get to the Windows 95 Startup menu when
	the delay is not adequate to catch it by pressing the F8 key when you see the
	"Starting Windows 95" message.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you boot your computer and attempt to get to the Windows 95 Startup menu,
	the "Starting Windows 95" message may not appear on your screen or may not
	appear long enough for you to press the F8 key.
	
	To get to the Startup menu, place a non-bootable floppy disk in drive A and
	restart your computer. When you are prompted with the message
	
	  Non system disk or Disk error, replace and strike any key when ready
	
	remove the disk and press F8 twice. The Startup menu is then displayed.
	
	NOTE: If your computer is configured to boot from drive C before drive A, this
	method may not work for you unless you reconfigure the computer to boot from
	drive A first. For information about how to do this, refer to your computer's
	documentation.
