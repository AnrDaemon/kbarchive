## Q168715: XGEN: CD Key Required for Exchange 5.0 Evaluation Software

	Article: Q168715

	Version(s): 5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Evaluation software requires a CD Key in order
	to install it. The Quick Setup Guide included in this kit gives the wrong CD Key
	for the Microsoft Outlook Evaluation software. In addition, no CD Key is given
	for the Microsoft Exchange Server software.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A CD Key is a series of numbers a customer is required to enter at setup time. A
	CD Key identifies that a customer has the legal right to use the software if he
	or she contacts Microsoft Technical Support. The evaluation versions of
	Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 are not supported and, therefore, should not have
	required a CD Key.
	
	The correct CD Keys are listed below. Please note that this problem only affects
	the evaluation version of Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, but it does not affect
	the evaluation version of the Microsoft Exchange Client software.
	
	  Evaluation version               CD Key to input

	  Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0    932-9619111
	
	  Microsoft Outlook 97 Client      9323-9619111
	
	NOTE: As indicated above, the Quick Setup Guide included with the evaluation
	software includes an incorrect CD Key for the Outlook Client. Instead of
	000-0000000, please use 9323-9619111
