	Article: Q168086
	Product(s): Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:7.0,7.5,95
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.0, 7.5 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select certain time zone settings in the Date/Time control panel on a
	Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 workstation, Microsoft Schedule+ may report
	incorrect time zone information.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In the Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 operating system, time zone information
	has been modified to bring it up to date with some changes in various countries
	or cities around the world. Because Microsoft Schedule+ was released before
	Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2, it may not always correctly match these
	updated or new time zones.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
	Schedule+ listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been
	corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version
	5.0. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
