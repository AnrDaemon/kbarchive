	are lost in the mailed document.

	In Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook 97:
	
	1. On the Compose menu, click New Message (Exchange), or click New Mail Message
	  (Outlook).
	
	2. Click the message area of the mail message.
	
	3. On the Insert menu, click File.
	
	4. Click the Word document or file you want to send as an attachment.
	
	  Under Insert As, click Attachment, and then click OK.
	
	Your Word document or file will now appear as an icon in your mail message.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	As you are typing your document, you may want to keep various drafts of the
	text. Each draft is a version of your final work. Many writers and editors
	retain each version of their work as a reference. In Word 97, you can keep a
	copy of the different versions within your document.
	
	To Save the Current Version of Your Document
	--------------------------------------------
	
	1. On the File menu, click Versions.
	
	2. Click Save Now.
	
	3. In the Save Version dialog box, type any comments you want saved with the
	  current version of your document, and then click OK.
	
	  NOTE: If you have not previously saved your document, you will be prompted to
	  save it. In the Save As dialog box, select the folder you want to save your
	  document in, enter the file name, and then click OK.
	
	To Open a Previous Version of Your Document
	-------------------------------------------
	
	1. On the File menu, click Versions.
	
	2. Under Existing Versions, click a version of your document, and then click
	  Open.
	
	For more information about how to use versions, click the Office Assistant, type
	"What are versions?," click Search, and then click to view "Review version
	information for a file" or "Delete one or more versions of a document."
