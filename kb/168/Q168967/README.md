	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a document from either an earlier version of Microsoft Word or a
	different word processing program, and save the file as a Microsoft Word 97
	document, the file size doubles or significantly increases in size.
	
	NOTE: This problem may also occur when you insert a file from an earlier version
	of Word (or a different application) or when you paste the document into a Word
	97 document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you first save the document in Microsoft Word 97, Word assumes that the
	document will not be compressed, and it allocates sufficient room for the
	contents of the document.

	Results will vary depending on the contents of the converted document; however,
	using one of the following methods may allow you to save the document without a
	significant increase in the document file size.

	------------------------------------
	
	Save the document a second time, but to a different folder.
	
	Method 2: Perform a Word Count
	------------------------------
	
	1. On the File menu, click Properties.
	
	2. Click the Statistics tab.
	
	3. Click OK and then save the document in Word 97.
	
	Method 3: Scroll Through the Document
	-------------------------------------
	
	Use the mouse to move the right, vertical scroll bar down to the end of the
	document and then save the document in Word 97.
	
	Method 4: Add Text to Document
