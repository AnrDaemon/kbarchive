	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you click Cancel during a Reinstall of The Puzzle Collection, the Setup
	program will not have a chance to update the product files. If Setup does not

	Puzzle Collection folder on the hard disk to become corrupted.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Canceling the Setup program during the copying of files from the compact disc to
	the hard disk will corrupt the files on the hard disk and you will no longer be
	able to play the games.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Restore the files on the hard disk by deleting the remaining files from the
	Puzzle Collection folder using Windows Explorer, and then run The Puzzle
	Collection Setup again.
