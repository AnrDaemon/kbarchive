	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Puzzle Collection Trial Version consists of snippets of 3 games: Finty
	Flush, Rat Poker, and Spring Weekend. You will be allowed to play the game for a
	few levels, and then the game will stop. A higher level of the game will be
	displayed, but the screen will be frozen and you will not be able to play the
	game. A "tip" will appear, urging you to buy the retail version of The Puzzle
	Collection.
	
	Depending on which keyboard language you use, The Puzzle Collection will allow
	you to install from one of seven different languages; however the trial version
	is only available in English.
	
	The trial version download will consist of one self-extracting executable (.exe)
	file. Double-clicking .exe will launch a "flat" Setup that will install the
	trial version to a chosen folder.

	Collection, Trial Version:
