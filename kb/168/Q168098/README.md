	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to open a password protected file in Word, one or more of the
	following error messages may be displayed:
	
	- Cannot convert password protected documents
	
	- Word cannot open the document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Access to a file is restricted when the document has been saved with any type of
	password protection. All of the converters in Microsoft Word will not convert
	password protected files.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Open and re-save the document without password protection in the original
	program before you open the document in Word.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You cannot convert a password-protected file created in another word processor
	(such as Word Perfect, AmiPro, or Enable) from any version of Word.
	
	NOTE: The password protection feature in Word requires you to type a case-
	sensitive password before you can open a document. Word converters do not prompt
	you for the password, and will not allow you to convert a password protected
	document.
