	This article provides a description of The Magic School Bus Explores the
	Rainforest.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Scholastic's The Magic School Bus Explores the Rainforest is the sixth title in
	the series of interactive multimedia science adventures designed for kids ages 6
	to 10.
	
	In this expedition, kids are in control as they drive "the Friz" and her students
	on a journey through the rain forest, which is teeming with diverse plants and
	animals. The class must "bioclone" bits of the lush ecosystem to help change
	their classroom into a replica of a rain forest. As kids drive the bus from
	river to understory and beyond, the bus provides a creature's-eye view of the
	activity by transforming into animals of the Rainforest, such as a snake and an
	eagle. Throughout the adventure, kids explore the teeming diversity of rain
	forest life, learning important science concepts and meeting interesting
	characters such as El Tigre the jaguar and Iggy Wanna.
	
	The Magic School Bus Explores the Rainforest includes several new features to
	make the program even more fun and engaging for kids, including five new
	multimedia tools they can use to explore the rain forest:
	
	- Field Guide: To hear a species' name, such as the tortoise beetle.
	- Spotting Scope: To view activities in the distance, such as an ocelot
	  climbing a tree.
	- Magnifying Glass: To give kids a closer look at rain forest life, such as a
	  termite nest.
	- Butterfly Net: To see full-color photographs of different butterflies, such
	  as the heliconious butterfly.
	- Microphone: To listen to rain forest sounds, such as the roar of a jaguar.
	
	Three new closed-captioned features, to help deaf or hard of hearing children.
	These include the ability to read the words to The Magic School Bus theme song,
	pause the program so kids have more time to read the dialogue captions, and
	print or read all of the spoken dialogue using the captions.txt file provided on
	the compact disc.
