	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To rename your FrontPage web, follow these steps:
	
	1. In FrontPage Explorer, open your Web.
	
	2. On the Tools menu, click Web Settings.
	
	3. Click the Configuration tab.
	
	4. In the Web Name box, type the new name you want to use for your web. This
	  name will become part of your Internet address. For example, if your content
	  is located on a Web server called, example.microsoft.com, and the name of
	  your Web is MyWeb, your Internet address will be:
	
	  http://example.microsoft.com/MyWeb
	
	  NOTE: If the Web Name box is not available (dimmed), the root Web is open. You
	  cannot rename the Web while it is open.
	
	5. In the Web Title box, type the title you want to use for your Web. This title
	  will be used to identify your Web in FrontPage, such as when you view the
	  list of Webs in the Getting Started dialog box.
