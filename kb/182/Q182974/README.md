	----------------------------------------------
	
	If the Weblinks Help file gets installed but the Word Main Help Index file

	  directory as the Word Main Help file (Wdmain8.hlp). The default location is
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office.
	
	2. Delete the Word Main Help Index file (Wdmain8.gid). NOTE: A new Wdmain8.gid
	  index file will be created the next time you start Help.
	
	3. Start Microsoft Word 97 and use the steps in the "How To Use The Word 97
	  Weblinks Help File" section of this article to test the help file.
