## Q182754: Win98 Resource Kit Beta CD-ROM Missing &#92;Betaonly Folder Files

	Article: Q182754

	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 17-DEC-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSPRESS Microsoft Windows 98 Resource Kit Beta Release 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The \Betaonly folder on the "Windows 98 Resource Kit Beta Release" CD-ROM does
	not contain files that are required to resolve a small number of Windows 98
	support issues. The top three issues relate to Winmodem, Fax, and Exchange
	e-mail client configuration for Windows 98 Beta3.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The "Windows 98 Resource Kit Beta Release" companion CD-ROM included the Windows
	98 Beta3 operating system software. However, unlike the Windows 98 Corporate
	Preview Program (CPP) Beta 3 CD-ROM, the Resource Kit version omitted most of
	the \Betaonly folder due to space constraints.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Microsoft Press has created a supplemental CD-ROM (part number 097-0002065)
	containing all \Betaonly files. This supplemental CD-ROM only contains utilities
	designed to resolve the problems described in this article.
	
	
	This supplemental part is available to Resource Kit owners in the United States
	by calling Microsoft Press Sales at 800-MSPRESS or by e-mailing the following
	information to Microsoft Press Sales:
	
	  TO: MSPORDER@MSN.COM
	  SUBJECT: Win98 ResKit Betaonly CD-ROM request
	  MESSAGE BODY:
	  <customer name>
	  <mailing address>
	  Phone: <phone number>
	
	  Please send one complementary "Windows 98 Resource Kit Beta Release" Betaonly
	  supplemental CD-ROM (part number 097-0002065) to the above address.
	
	Outside the United States, please contact your local Microsoft Press distributor
	and request the "Windows 98 Resource Kit Beta Release" Betaonly supplement (part
	number 097-0002065) or e-mail MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM using the same request
	format listed above. Please note that international fulfillment of this beta
	release supplemental CD-ROM will take extra time and is provided on a
	commerically reasonable basis only.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	As of March 16, 1998, Microsoft Press is in the process of manufacturing the
	supplemental CD-ROM mentioned above.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are three main support issues that affect a small percent of all beta
	users. These issues require the \Betaonly files to resolve:
	
	- Winmodem modems cannot be successfully installed without the contents of the
	  \Betaonly\Winmodem folder. A download patch is not available due to not
	  having a functional modem.
	
	- If a customer is upgrading over Windows 3x or Windows for Workgroups 3x,
	  their Workgroup mail or Microsoft Mail will be deleted upon upgrading. The
	  \Betaonly\Exchange folder is required to restore a working mail client.
	
	  If a customer is upgrading over Windows 95, their Microsoft Exchange or
	  Windows Messaging client should continue working after the upgrade. If it
	  subsequently fails, the \Betaonly\Exchange folder is required to restore a
	  working mail client.
	
	- If a customer upgrades over Windows 3x or Windows for Workgroups 3x, their At
	  Work Fax is deleted upon upgrading. The \Betaonly\Exchange and \Betaonly\Fax
	  folders are required to restore a working Fax client.
	
	  If a customer is upgrading over Windows 95, their Fax client should continue
	  working after the upgrade. If it subsequently fails, the \Betaonly\Fax folder
	  is required to restore a working Fax client.
