	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select the Reverse Print Order option in Microsoft Word and print to an
	Epson Stylus 500, the printout may not print in reverse print order.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Epson Stylus 500 also has a Reverse Page Order option in the printer driver
	properties. If you turn on both this option and the Reverse Print Order option
	in Word, your document is not printed in reverse order.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To print in reverse print order, select either the Reserve Page Order option in
	the Epson Stylus 500 printer driver, or the Reverse Print Order option in Word,
	but do not select both at the same time.
	
	To locate the Reverse Print Order option in Word, click Options on the Tools menu
	and then click the Print tab.
	
	To locate the Reverse Page Order option in the Epson Stylus 500 printer driver,
	click Print on the File menu. In the Print dialog box, click Properties and then
	click the Main tab.
