	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to dial out using a PC Card modem on a Toshiba Satellite 200C
	computer, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  Another program is using this telephony device.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you use the SystemSoft CardWizard that is included
	with the Toshiba Satellite 200C computer. The SystemSoft CardWizard detects the
	modem and creates a .inf file that prevents Windows 95 from correctly detecting
	the modem.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, obtain and install the Cwinffix.exe file from Toshiba. To
	obtain this file, contact Toshiba or visit the following Toshiba Web site:
