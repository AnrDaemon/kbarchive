	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The IRMA board is not supported by Microsoft Mail (PC Client). Microsoft did not
	test the Mail PC Client with the IRMA board, IBM PC 3270, or any other computer
	that uses a 3270 emulation board.
	
	Microsoft does not guarantee the Mail PC Client's performance under this type of
	operating environment.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The IRMA board, along with its driver software, provides an interface between a
	PC and an IBM 3270 mainframe computer. Through "windows," the PC can run
	3270-based applications (such as a 3270 workstation) and a PC-based application
	at the same time. A "hotkey" sequence allows the user to switch between the two
	different applications. The IBM PC 3270 is a PC/AT that has built-in 3270
	workstation capabilities.
	
	The Mail PC Client uses the Character Oriented Window (COW) interface, which can
	experience severe compatibility problems with a PC that operates as a 3270
	workstation.
