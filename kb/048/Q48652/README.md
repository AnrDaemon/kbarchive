	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To determine the serial number of the Microsoft Mail server on the Installer
	disk, follow these steps:
	
	1. Install the Microsoft Mail server on a Macintosh isolated from the network.
	
	2. Restart the Macintosh.
	
	3. Go to the Chooser and click the Mail driver icon. The server name is
	  displayed on the right side. The number that is part of the name is the
	  server serial number.
	
	Please note that the Mail version 2.0 driver is named "MS Mail 2.0," and the Mail
	version 3.0 driver is named "MS Mail."
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The serial number of the Mail server is not located on the label of the
	Installer disk, nor is it in the Get Info window of the Microsoft Mail Server
	software. After you determine the serial number using the procedure given above,
	write this information on the label of that server Installer disk. This avoids
	confusion if you have more than one server Installer disk.
	
	Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
