	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail, you cannot use some of the keys on your keyboard to type a
	user name. These keys and combinations of keys are interpreted by Mail as
	commands to do some specific action.
	
	For example, the ESC key in the upper-left corner of your keyboard closes most of
	the windows in Mail.
	
	The following characters/keys are not allowed as part of a user name:
	
	  ESC
	  CLEAR
	  COMMAND
	  OPTION
	  SHIFT
	  CTRL
	  DELETE on the regular keyboard
	  TAB
	  Direction arrows
	
	The following characters/keys are allowed as part of a user name:
	
	  Function keys F1 - F15
	  PGUP
	  PGDN
	  HOME
	  END
	  DEL (located between the regular keyboard and numeric keypad on an extended
	  keyboard)
	
	Note that many of these keys are available only on the standard and extended
	Macintosh keyboards.
	
	
	Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a 3.00b 3.10 3.10a 3.10c
