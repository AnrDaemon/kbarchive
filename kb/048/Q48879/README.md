	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail version 2.0, if you try to create a user name with all spaces,
	the following message appears:
	
	  That name could not be added to your list of users... The Mail Server may
	  have run out of storage space... Please check.
	
	In Microsoft Mail version 3.0, if you type all spaces for a user name, the Add
	button remains dimmed and can't be clicked.
	
	A blank space is not a valid name for a user in Microsoft Mail. On the other
	hand, a blank space is allowed as a password.
