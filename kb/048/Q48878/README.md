	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail, the Network Manager is the only recipient of an inquiry
	message. It is an auto-addressed form. Therefore, the Network Manager is unable
	to forward an inquiry message.
	
	The Network Manager can create a custom inquiry form that gives the Network
	Manager the option of forwarding the message to other users.

	================
	
	For more information on how to create a custom form, see the "Using Custom Forms
	in Microsoft Mail" appendix in the "Microsoft Mail Network Manager's Guide."
