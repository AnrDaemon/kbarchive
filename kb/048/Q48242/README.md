	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To print a field with its corresponding label when designing a form with the
	Forms Designer in Microsoft Mail, the label's field name should include the name
	of the field followed by the word "Label" (without the quotation marks).
	
	For example, if there is a text field with the field name of "From", the field
	should be called "From Label" so mail knows that the label and the text field
	are associated on the printed form.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Please note that there is a difference between the label and the label's field
	name.
	
	The label's field name is the name given to the label in the Field Info dialog
	box.
	
	The label is the text to be displayed next to a field in the final form.
	
	The Field Info dialog box can be accessed by double-clicking a field or by
	selecting a field and choosing Field Info from the Objects menu.
