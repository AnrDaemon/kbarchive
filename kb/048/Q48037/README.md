	The information in this article applies to:

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following are the three ways to select recipients of Microsoft Mail
	messages:
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	Select user names from the Simple User List. To display this list in the Send
	screen, choose the Simple User List option in the Preferences dialog box
	(Preferences is under the Mail menu).
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	Click the Address icon in the Send screen and select users in the Address Mail
	window. To display this icon in the Send screen, choose the Address Window
	option in the Preferences dialog box. All or part of the name can be typed to
	reduce the list of names displayed. Selecting different Addressing Icons will
	also reduce or increase the available addressing choices.
	
	Method 3
	--------
	
	Create a form with a fixed list of recipients, users, and/or groups. In this
	case, the mail message is sent to these preselected mail recipients. For more
	information on how to create this type of form, query on the following
	keywords:
	
	  " form and permanent " (without the quotation marks)
	
	NOTE: When you are using the Forms Designer to create a custom form, a separate
	field cannot be created to allow a user to type a user and/or group name as a
	mail recipient. The User List, Address Window, or predefined list must be used
	for addressing.
