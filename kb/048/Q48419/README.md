	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Zenith 386/16, Zenith 286LP, and Zenith 25 running Zenith DOS 3.3-Plus will
	hang at the end of the Flight Instruction lesson when the flight instructor
	issues the final comments concerning the student's lesson that was just
	completed. Updating to MS-DOS Version 3.31 or later eliminates this problem.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
