	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The printed output from your Okidata printer is wavey or uneven.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Most Okidata printers print graphics bidirectionally. This causes one line to
	angle one direction while the next line is angled in the opposite direction.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, set graphics printing to unidirectional in the
	printer's setup menu. Instructions for how to do this are found in the printer's
	manual.
