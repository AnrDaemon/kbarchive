## Q48687: Invoking M or MEP with the /D Switch Prevents Initialization

	Invoking the Microsoft M editor with the /D switch to prevent it from
	initializing from the TOOLS.INI file also prevents the Initialization
	function (SHIFT+F8) from reading the TOOLS.INI file.
	
	There is currently no workaround for this designed limitation other
	than to exit the editor and re-invoke M without using the /D switch.
