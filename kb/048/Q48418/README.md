	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	With the Weather Generator activated in Flight Simulator Version 4.00, you can
	see water through the storm-front clouds. On the way up through the cloud, the
	cloud appears to cover the entire water region of Lake Michigan. However, once
	you are above the cloud, you can see all of Lake Michigan, as though there are
	no clouds above the water.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
