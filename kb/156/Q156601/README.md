	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Windows NT 4.0, your computer may pause at the blue startup
	screen for 30 to 45 seconds.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if your computer has both one or more IDE hard disks and
	one or more SCSI hard disks. The pause results from the detection code used
	during startup.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
	4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
