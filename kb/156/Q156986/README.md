	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using MSN, The Microsoft Network, as your Internet service provider
	and you start the MSN Dial-Up Networking connection to connect to the Internet,
	you may receive the following error message:
	
	  Dial-Up Networking
	  The computer you're dialing in to cannot establish a Dial-Up Networking
	  connection.
	  Check your password, and then try again.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The MSN connection requires your user name to be entered using the "MSN/<user
	name>" format. If the "MSN/" prefix is missing, you receive the error
	message.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Change your user name in the MSN Dial-Up Networking connection to use the
	"MSN/<user name>" format, where <user name> is your MSN member ID.
	To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Dial-Up
	  Networking.
	
	2. Double-click MSN and MSN Backup (for advanced use only), if present.
	
	3. Type your MSN user name as "MSN/<user_name>" (without the quotation
	  marks). Substitute your MSN member ID for <user_name>.
	
	4. In the Password box, type your MSN password and then click Connect.
