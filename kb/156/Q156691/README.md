	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Although you can display the attributes of a file or directory, you cannot
	change them in Windows Explorer or My Computer. The system attribute check box
	is displayed but is disabled when you view the properties of the file or the
	directory.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design and is consistent with the Microsoft Windows 95 versions of
	Windows Explorer and My Computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To modify the attributes of a file or a directory, use the ATTRIB command from
	the Windows NT command prompt, or use File Manager (Winfile.exe).
