	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Changing the Video Display to 256 or Greater Colors
	---------------------------------------------------
	
	Your computer must display at least 256 colors to run Deadly Tide.
	
	To display 256 or greater colors in Windows 95/98:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the Display icon.
	
	3. Click the Settings tab.
	
	4. Under Color Palette or Colors, click 256, High, or True Color.
	
	5. Click OK.
	
	If you don't have the necessary 256-color driver, or if you aren't sure that your
	video card supports at least 256 colors, contact your video card manufacturer.
	
	If Your Screen Blanks After Adding a New Pilot
	----------------------------------------------
	
	If your screen blanks after adding a pilot name in the Pilot sign-in box, insert
	Disc 1 before restarting the game.
	
	If You Click Start in the PCC and You Cannot Start
	--------------------------------------------------
	
	If you click Start in the Pilot Control Center (PCC) and it returns you to the
	PCC, your video card driver might not support the graphic quality mode you have
	chosen. Select a different graphic quality mode and try again. If none of the
	graphic quality modes work, contact your video card manufacturer for the latest
	DirectX-compatible video drivers.
	
	If You Experience Other Display Problems
	----------------------------------------
	
	- If you experience other display problems, see the DirectX section of this
	  Readme file in Section B, "Installation Notes." You may have to contact your
	  video card manufacturer for the latest DirectX 2.0 drivers.
	
	- Try installing an updated version of DirectX.
	
	  The latest version of DirectX is available at the following Microsoft Web
	  site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/directx
	
	  For more information about how to obtain the latest version of DirectX, please
	  see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q179113 How to Download and Install DirectX
	
	  NOTE: Most DirectX related problems have been resolved in the latest version
	  of DirectX. Download the latest version of DirectX or, if you own a game that
	  installs a newer version of DirectX, install DirectX from the newer game's
	  CD-ROM.
	
	- General video problems, such as banding, slow performance, crashing, and so
	  on may be caused by not having the proper DirectX drivers installed.
	
	  To reinstall DirectX drivers:
	
	  1. Insert Deadly Tide Disc 1 into your CD-ROM drive.
	
	  2. Double-click My Computer.
	
	  3. Right-click Deadlytide1.
	
	  4. Click Install DirectX.
	
	  5. Click ReInstall DirectX.
