	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In The Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs, when you create a Past
	Card containing a long text string, individual characters in the text string may
	be truncated.
	
	Text strings that are 16-25 characters long without spaces (for example,
	"1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKL"), display this behavior. The text appears correctly as
	long as the text box is highlighted.
	
	When you click the right text box to shift focus, the characters on the right
	side of the left text box are truncated.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The only way to prevent truncation is to use shorter text strings so the line
	breaks move the text to the next line.
