	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to print multiple envelopes using the single sheet input slot
	on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 5L printer, only one envelope is printed at a
	time. After one envelope is printed, the printer goes offline and you must press
	the Online button to print the next envelope.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when the printer is unable to detect the presence of the
	additional envelopes or is unable to feed the additional envelopes into the
	printer. This behavior is not caused by a problem in Windows or Windows for
	Workgroups version 3.x or Windows 95 and occurs no matter which printer driver
	you are using and the program you are printing from.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	For information about how to work around this problem, contact Hewlett-
	Packard.
