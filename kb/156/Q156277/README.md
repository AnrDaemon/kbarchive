	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows NT 4.0 may stop responding when the computer it is installed on also
	contains a Matrox Millennium video card. This occurs when you copy a file to the
	floppy disk. It may also occur when playing a sound on a sound card.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is due to a BIOS conflict with the hardware. Please contact the
	manufacturer of the hardware for a BIOS upgrade.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You can avoid this problem by using the Standard VGA driver instead of the
	Matrox Millennium driver.
