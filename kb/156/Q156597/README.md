	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When choosing Head To Head game on two directly connected computers, you get the
	following error message:
	
	  A valid TCP/IP connection is required for Two Player play.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Your computer must be configured to use an Internet Protocol(IP) Address to play
	a head-to-head game in Close Combat. This article explains how to configure the
	necessary TCP/IP settings for two Macintosh computers directly connected to one
	another.
	
	You must configure an IP Address for each of the two machines to play a
	head-to-head game in Close Combat.
	
	NOTE: Because you are not playing across a network, these IP Addresses do not
	have to be addresses assigned by a network system administrator or by an
	Internet service provider. They can be any series of numbers you and your
	opponent choose (for example, 111.11.111.111 for one machine and another IP
	address for the other machine). Any series of numbers will work. Make a note of
	the numbers you choose. You will need to know these numbers later.
	
	For head-to-head play, each player must have a Close Combat compact disc.
	
	Use the following steps to configure your IP Address for head-to-head play on the
	Macintosh:
	
	1. Go to Control Panels.
	
	2. Select TCP/IP.
	
	3. Connect via: Ethernet.
	
	4. Configure: Manually.
	
	5. Type "<xxx.xx.xxx.xxx>" (without the quotation marks) in the IP Address
	  field (where <xxx.xx.xxx.xxx> is the numbers you chose.)
	
	6. Close TCP/IP. If prompted to Save, click Save.
	
	7. You may get a dialog box that says
	
	  You have not provided a subnet mask value. TCP/IP will use a default subnet
	  mask that corresponds to your IP address.
	
	8. Click Continue.
	
	9. Open Close Combat.
	
	10. Select Head to Head Play (button with two heads). The Two Player Options
	  dialog box should open.
	
	11. Type your opponent's IP address in the Remote IP Address field. (Remember:
	  This can be any number the two of you have agreed upon.)
	
	12. If you are initiating the connection, then choose that option. If you are
	  waiting for your opponent to connect with your machine, then choose that
	  option. (In this instance, this article will assume that you are initiating
	  the connection. The other player must enter your IP address in his/her
	  Remote IP Address field, click Wait For Connection, and then click OK. You
	  may hear a message saying, "Waiting for connection."
	
	13. On the machine that is initiating connection, click Begin. The Initiating
	  Game With Address "xxx.xx.xxx.xxx" dialog box appears. After a few seconds,
	  you and your opponent should hear "Connection Established."
	
	14. Both players should select Begin.
	
	15. You should both hear, synchronizing machines.
	
	16. You may both deploy your troops and begin playing Close Combat.
