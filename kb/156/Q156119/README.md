	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses the Manic Marbles trail version game characters. The
	trial version comes with the SideWinder game pad.
	
	MICROSOFT MARBLES CHARACTERS
	----------------------------
	
	Bertha Burp:
	
	Bertha is a private school brat who finds great humor in anything involving
	bodily functions. She's 12 years old and wants to be either a micro- surgeon or
	the captain of a starship when she grows up. Her favorite beverage is Gasser's
	cream soda and drinks it constantly, fueling mind- warping belches that she
	feels gives her a distinct personality. Surprisingly, she is an "A" student at
	Green Hedges middle school and is gifted with an almost psychic knowledge of the
	nearest retailer of Gasser's cream soda.
	
	- Charge: Aim your marble at its target and charge into the target for an extra
	  punch.
	
	- Jump:
	  Your marbles jumps into the air briefly.
	
	- Bubble Burp:
	  Marbles that are hit by Bubble Burp are trapped in a bubble that carries them
	  above the playing fields, which you control with your movement keys.
	
	- Bubble Shield:
	  Pressing the Bubble Shield protects Bertha for a short period of time. All
	  marbles and objects bounce off her.
	
	Farmer Pete and Bessie:
	
	Farmer Pete (Earthling) is the owner of a dairy farm and also breeds midget cows
	for wrestling competitions in the nearby town of Cheesewater, USA. The might of
	his greatest prize fighting cow, Bessie, is her ability to squirt milk from her
	udders with the intensity of a hydraulic jack-hammer. The two characters have a
	love-hate relationship, yet both are uncultured and rough around the edges.
	Farmer Pete believes that he is the dominant one in their turbulent
	relationship, but it's Bessie that calls the shots.
	
	- Charge: Aim your marble at its target and charge into the target for an extra
	  punch.
	
	- Jump:
	  Your marbles jumps into the air briefly.
	
	- Squirts Milk:
	  Aim Bessie to squirt milk and drive opponents away.
	
	- Brakes:
	  Pressing the Brakes key brings Pete and Bessie to a quick stop.
	
	Wiggly Squiggly:
	
	Wiggly Squiggly is from the planet Twine. He is eighty-seven percent string
	matter except for his head, which is made of a putty-like substance. He is
	extremely timid and fearful of anything mobile but unleashes an incredible
	barrage of defense mechanisms if he is taunted (much like a scared skunk). If
	there is any creature in the universe who needs to relax, it's Wiggly Squiggly
	(or "Wiggs"). He has the ability to unravel and form into other objects, which
	is very useful in his defense maneuvers. Wiggly Squiggly enjoys chewing on a
	substance known as Yarnish, which is similar to gum. This substance is also used
	for many purposes such as food, projectiles, medicine, and currency on his
	planet.
	
	- Charge: Aim your marble at its target and charge into the target for an extra
	  punch.
	
	- Jump:
	  Your marbles jumps into the air briefly.
	
	- Spit:
	  Aim Wiggs to spit Yarnish at other opponents to keep them from getting too
	  close.
	
	- Flatten:
	  Pressing Flatten will cause Wiggs to unravel, causing opponents to roll over
	  him without causing any damage.
	
	The Schreckster:
	
	The Schreckster is from a planet by the name of Slayron Six. On Slayron Six,
	crime is out of control and requires an elite group of guys who basically scare
	the heck out of everyone so that they'll be good. These scary guys are called
	Schrecksters and are very useful for keeping people in line. No one has ever
	seen The Schreckster's face. If his face were ever seen, the sight would be so
	terrifying that you would go into instant shock. Ironically, despite this
	fellow's frightening appearance and gruff voice he has the tendency to break
	down and cry like a baby if you taunt him or treat him poorly.
	
	- Charge: Aim your marble at its target and charge into the target for an extra
	  punch.
	
	- Jump:
	  Your marbles jumps into the air briefly.
	
	- Scream:
	  Aim and hold down the button to send a Sonic scream shockwave. This scream
	  pushes opponents back.
	
	- Enlarge:
	  Pressing Enlarge causes The Schreckster to grow to twice his normal size,
	  making it almost impossible for opponents to move him.
