	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you use Write-Up to create a Word document based on your PowerPoint
	presentation, then save the document, in most cases the document (.doc) file has
	a larger size than your presentation (.ppt) file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Most PowerPoint presentations have graphics on the Slide Master. These graphics
	appear on every slide, but are stored only once in the file. When you create a
	Write-Up document, these graphics are saved each time they appear on a slide.
