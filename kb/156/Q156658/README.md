	- Microsoft Deadly Tide for Windows 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses ways to improve Deadly Tide performance if the game is
	running slowly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Graphic Quality
	---------------
	
	Deadly Tide examines the capabilities of your graphics hardware and drivers to
	determine available graphic quality modes. Depending on your hardware, some
	modes may cause the game to run more slowly.
	
	If Deadly Tide is running slowly, try improving performance by decreasing your
	graphic quality to Level I (in the Pilot Control Center). After adjusting your
	graphic quality, you will be prompted to begin Deadly Tide from your last saved
	point, if you have the gameplay portion running.
	
	CD-ROM Performance
	------------------
	
	Deadly Tide runs a CD-ROM performance test during installation to determine your
	CD-ROM drive's performance. This test gives a warning if your CD-ROM drive's
	performance is not sufficient to smoothly play Deadly Tide. If you get this
	warning and choose to continue to install, Deadly Tide will still run, but it
	might be slow in some cases. The following suggestions might help increase your
	CD-ROM drive's performance.
	
	Older CD-ROM Drivers:
	
	Check the performance of your system to see if you need updated Windows 95/98
	drivers.
	
	To check your system's performance
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the System icon.
	
	3. Click the Performance tab.
	
	4. Make sure this page states "Your system is configured for optimal
	  performance." If it doesn't, check with the CD-ROM drive manufacturer for
	  updated Windows 95/98 drivers.
	
	Slow CD-ROM Interface:
	
	We have found in some cases that a CD-ROM drive using a controller on a sound
	board has caused poor performance. If possible, use a different controller for
	the CD-ROM drive.
