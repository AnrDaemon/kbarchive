	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the playing fields in the Manic Marbles trail version
	that comes with the SideWinder game pad.
	
	PLAYING FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
	--------------------------
	
	4 Corners:
	
	In 4 Corners, marbles battle it out on a square playing field with rising and
	falling corner column elevators. If the corners are lowered, marbles can roll
	off the playing field. Players must also be careful of the columns rising
	because they could be shot off the playing field.
	
	Quick Overview:
	
	- Death when you fall off corner edges.
	
	- Elevators at corners go up when you go over them, and go down when you
	  collide with them.
	
	- Solid walls around edges (Second Chance control affects these walls).
	
	- Second Chance controls: a) toggle top elevators to move up or down; b) toggle
	  bottom elevators to move up or down.
	
	Trap Door:
	
	The trap door playing field is a square surrounded by a solid wall. The danger
	area on this playing field is the trap door in the center of the field. The trap
	door opens if a marble is on the door for longer than 2 seconds. The first
	player to assume Second Chance control controls the tilting of the playing field
	while the second one controls the trap door.
	
	Quick Overview:
	
	- The trap door in the middle is deadly. It opens if a player is on it for 2
	  seconds.
	
	- All 4 walls are solid/safe.
	
	- Second Chance controls: a)tilting of playing field; b)trap door.
	
	Bumpers:
	
	This rectangular playing field has two ramps on the left and right sides. The
	danger areas are the left and right playing field edges and the front Plexiglas
	walls. The Plexiglas walls can be shattered over time. The Second Chance
	controls are the two pinball-style bumpers on either side of the field. The
	bumpers can be moved around half of the playing field in an attempt to check the
	player through the Plexiglas or off the left or right edge of the playing
	field.
	
	Quick Overview:
	
	- Death when you fall over left and right edge.
	
	- Plexiglas walls at front breaks after multiple collisions.
	
	- Safe areas at back and front sides, two bumpers.
	
	- Second Chance controls: a) one of the two bumpers; b) can slowly move them
	  around.
