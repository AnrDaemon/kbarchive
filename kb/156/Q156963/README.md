	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use an English Microsoft Mail client running on Korean Windows 3.1 to
	send a message containing Korean characters to another English Microsoft Mail
	client on Korean Windows 3.1, the Korean characters can be viewed correctly by
	the recipient. However, when the message is sent to or from a Korean Microsoft
	Exchange client running on Korean Windows NT 3.51, the Korean characters are
	corrupted. This occurs when the Microsoft Exchange MS Mail Connector is used to
	connect English Microsoft Mail to Microsoft Exchange Server.
	
	STATUS

	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
