	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following are known errors in the Game Reference documentation for Close
	Combat:
	
	- On page 175 of the Index, the Game Reference manual states that information
	  on Troop carriers can be found on page 117. This information can actually be
	  found on page 110.
	
	- On page 170 of the Index, the Game Reference manual states that information
	  about Halftracks can be found on page 117. This information can actually be
	  found on page 110.
	
	- Although it is stated in the Game Reference manual that Troop carriers and
	  Halftracks were used for the transportation of troops in the War, you cannot
	  order troops to go into these vehicles in Close Combat. There intended use
	  for game play is to provide suppression fire and/or support fire during
	  infantry assaults.
