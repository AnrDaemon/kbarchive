	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses how to solve sound problems you may encounter when
	running Full Court Press.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If Full Court Press does not play sound properly, first verify:
	
	- You've correctly installed your Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 4.0 sound
	  drivers.
	
	- Your speakers are on and turned up.
	
	- The Windows 95/98 volume control is enabled and turned up, and that the Mute
	  check box is not selected.
	
	- If Full Court Press still doesn't play sound properly, verify that Windows
	  95/98 can play .wav files:
	
	  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  2. Double-click the Sounds icon.
	
	  3. Under Events, click an event that has a loudspeaker icon next to it.
	
	  4. In the Name text box, be sure that the three-letter file extension is
	     ".wav".
	
	  5. Under Preview, click the Play button. You should hear a sound.
	
	  If you don't hear any sound, or if Windows 95/98 is not able to play a .wav
	  file, check to see that a sound driver is enabled:
	
	  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  b. Double-click the System icon.
	
	  c. Click the Device Manager tab.
	
	  d. Click the plus sign next to Sound, Video And Game Controllers.
	
	  e. If there is no Sound, Video And Game Controllers entry, or you have no
	     sound card listed under this entry, contact the manufacturer of the
	     computer or sound card and request help for re-installing the sound card
	     drivers.
	
	  If you are able to play a .wav file in Windows 95/98, be sure that sounds are
	  enabled and recognized in Full Court Press:
	
	  a. Start Full Court Press.
	
	  b. On the Start Up screen, click Options, and then click Sound.
	
	  c. Make sure that all the red sliders are at least halfway over, and then
	     click OK.
	
	  d. To check whether Full Court Press will play a sound file, click any button
	     on the Start Up screen.
	
	  If you are using Windows NT 4.0, the sound may be choppy during setup, but
	  will work normally while you are running Full Court Press.
	
	NOTE: You can install higher quality sounds from the Custom installation option.
