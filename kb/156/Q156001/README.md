## Q156001: PowerPoint 4.0 Presentations Not Recognized in Exchange Folder

	Article: Q156001
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:7.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbinterop

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You can drag a PowerPoint 95 presentation from a My Computer or Windows Explorer
	window to a folder in Microsoft Exchange. That presentation appears as a
	PowerPoint document when you open the Exchange folder. If you double-click the
	document, PowerPoint will start and open the presentation.
	
	Similarly, you can drag a PowerPoint 4.0 presentation to a Microsoft Exchange
	folder and then double-click it to open the presentation.
	
	However, if you drag a presentation that was saved in PowerPoint 95 as a
	PowerPoint 4.0 presentation to a Microsoft Exchange folder, you may receive the
	following message when you double-click it:
	
	  A problem occurred while working with, or connecting to, a linked or an
	  embedded object or its source application.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you want to place a PowerPoint 95 presentation saved in PowerPoint 4.0 format
	in a Microsoft Exchange folder, you can do the following:
	
	1. In Microsoft Exchange, compose a new message.
	
	2. Drag the PowerPoint presentation from a Windows Explorer window to your new
	  message.
	
	3. Save the new message to the desired folder.
	
	If the destination folder is a public folder, other people can now open your
	message, double-click the PowerPoint presentation object, and view the
	presentation.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 7.0 for
	Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
