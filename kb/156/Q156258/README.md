	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The command prompt (Cmd.exe) in Windows NT does not recognize the end-of- file
	character (0x1A) in batch and text files.
	
	Specifically, batch files do not cease execution upon encountering the
	end-of-file character, nor does the TYPE command stop displaying text when it
	encounters the end-of-file character.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT versions
	3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
