	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	The Systems Management Server 1.2 Release Notes contains the following
	information in the Upgrade Information section:
	
	  Before you upgrade a Systems Management Server (SMS) system, Microsoft
	  strongly recommends that you read Systems Management Server Installation and
	  Configuration, Chapter 4, section Adding Clients. Specifically, make sure you
	  understand the effects of:
	
	  The Permitted Viewers list in the registry.
	
	  The rights required on computers running Windows NT Workstation to allow
	  inventory and client setup to work correctly.

	Adding Clients section of the Installation and Configuration Guide,
	
	Information about "The Permitted Viewers list in the registry" exists in Chapter
	10, Configuring Client Remote Control, of the Remote Troubleshooting section of
	the Administrators Guide.
