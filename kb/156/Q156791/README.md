	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Creative Writer 2 will not import cards created in Creative Writer 1.x.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The new Creative Writer 2 word processing program will not import Creative
	Writer 1.x card layout for correct printing. As a result, the limited
	functionality in card importing is by design.
	
	If you have both Creative Writer 1.0 and Creative Writer 2 installed on the same
	machine, you can transfer a Creative Writer 1.x card to Creative Writer 2.0, by
	copying and pasting the card information from Creative Writer 1.x to Creative
	Writer 2.
