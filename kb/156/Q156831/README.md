	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To shoot the ball from the free throw line, you need to hold the shoot button
	down, or tap it several times. In game play each time you tap the shoot button
	the player pump fakes, but from the free throw line there is no pump fake and
	the player will not release the ball.
	
	If you release the shoot button at just the right moment, the player shoots the
	ball. The shot ranges for players in Full Court Press vary by player skill
	level. The shot range for good shooters is much larger than the shot range for
	bad shooters, and therefore gives you a much greater margin for error.
