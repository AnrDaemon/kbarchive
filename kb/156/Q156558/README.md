	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click a web link in one of the Microsoft products listed at the top of
	this article, your web browser does not automatically start. You may receive an
	error message similar to the following:
	
	  Your browser could not be launched. Close any open applications and try
	  again. If nothing else is open, re-install your browser and try again.
	
	This occurs when you are using Netscape Navigator version 2.0 as your browser.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Netscape Navigator 2.0 does not register itself with Windows 95 for the type of
	access used by these programs. Special registration is needed to allow Windows
	95 programs to automatically start a web browser.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Download Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 or 3.0, which installs universal
	Internet settings for Windows 95. The latest editions of Internet Explorer are
	available on the Microsoft web site at:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/ie
	
	After you install Internet Explorer version 2.0 or newer, Windows 95 can
	automatically start your default web browser, including Netscape Navigator. The
	first time you run Internet Explorer, it will ask if you wish to set it as your
	default web browser. If you wish to continue using Netscape Navigator as your
	default web browser, be sure to click No.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Internet Explorer Setup installs universal Internet settings for Windows 95. By
	changing the properties of the Internet icon on your desktop, you can configure
	Dial-up settings, proxy connections and other options for basic Internet
	access.
