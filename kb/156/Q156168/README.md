	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Unlike Visual FoxPro 3.0 for Windows, Visual FoxPro 5.0 does not run or create
	executable files for 16-bit operating systems, such as Windows 3.1 or Windows
	for Workgroups. Visual FoxPro 5.0 runs only on the Windows 95 and the Windows NT
	32-bit operating systems.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Visual FoxPro 5.0 no longer supports the Win32s subsystem. The Win32s files
	allow the native Visual FoxPro 32-bit application code to communicate with
	16-bit operating systems. By not supporting the Win32s subsystem, Visual FoxPro
	5.0 hopes to improve performance, increase stability, and reduce overhead.
