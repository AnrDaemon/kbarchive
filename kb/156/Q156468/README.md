	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Creative Writer 2, you may create web links using the Web Link tool. Though
	you will be asked to type in a valid http:// address, the program will allow
	invalid addresses and create a null link. For example, you can type in http://
	or leave the field blank, and the null link will be created.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	It is important to have the correct Internet address (http://) of the site to
	which you intend to link. The Internet is very dynamic, and addresses frequently
	change. As a result, Creative Writer will not try to resolve addresses or syntax
	that do not exist.
