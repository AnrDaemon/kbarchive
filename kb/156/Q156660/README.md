	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you try to upgrade to Windows NT Server version 4.0 from another operating
	system, setup may prompt for the installation media for the previous operating
	system. Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server setup may also request the media for a
	previous version of Windows NT.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are different upgrade products for Microsoft Windows NT Server version
	4.0. There is a standard upgrade package for upgrading from a previous version
	of Windows NT, and there is a competitive upgrade to migrate from another
	operating system.
	
	If you are migrating from another operating system, make sure the product ID for
	the upgrade package is correct for the competitive upgrade. If you try to use
	the standard upgrade package to migrate from another operating system, the
	installation may not finish.
	
	For more information, consult your software retailer or contact Microsoft Sales
	at (800) 426-9400 to determine if you have the correct upgrade package.
