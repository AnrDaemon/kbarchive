	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you insert a metafile graphic into a Creative Writer 2 document, you may
	notice a significant decrease in the overall performance of the product.
	
	Metafiles, particularly large metafiles, slow down the program by slowing down
	OLE processes within the program. Redrawing the graphics can affect performance
	by slowing down machines that barely meet the minimum system requirements.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer 2.
