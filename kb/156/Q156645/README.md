	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you are experiencing sound problems, please use the following list of
	troubleshooting steps (note that there is no sound in the Pilot Control Center
	under Windows NT due to system incompatibility at the time of release).
	
	- Verify that your speaker and volume control are enabled and turned up.
	
	- Make sure that Windows 95/98 has sound.
	
	  To verify that Windows 95/98 has sound:
	
	  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  2. Double-click the Sounds icon.
	
	  3. Play a .wav file.
	
	- If Windows 95/98 cannot play a .wav file, check to see that a sound driver is
	  enabled.
	
	  To enable a sound driver:
	
	  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	  2. Double-click the System icon.
	
	  3. Click the Device Manager tab.
	
	  4. Click the plus sign next to Sound, Video And Game Controllers.
	
	  If you have a sound card and there is no Sound, Video And Game Controllers
	  entry or you have no sound card listed, contact the manufacturer of the
	  computer or sound card for help on how to reinstall the sound card drivers.
	
	- If Windows 95/98 can play a .wav file, verify that your sound card is
	  supported by DirectSound and that you are using the latest DirectX-compatible
	  sound drivers.
	
	  To see whether or not your sound card is supported by DirectX:
	
	  1. Insert Deadly Tide Disc 1 into your CD-ROM drive.
	
	  2. Double-click My Computer.
	
	  3. Right-click Deadlytide1.
	
	  4. Click Install DirectX.
	
	  5. If DirectSound is listed as having No Hardware in the DirectX Setup dialog
	     box, click Reinstall DirectX.
	
	- Install the latest version of DirectX
	
	  The latest version of DirectX is available at the following Microsoft Web
	  site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/directx
	
	  For more information about how to obtain the latest version of DirectX, please

	  NOTE: Most DirectX related problems have been resolved in the latest version
	  of DirectX. Download the latest version of DirectX or, if you own a game that
	  installs a newer version of DirectX, install DirectX from the newer game's
	  CD-ROM.
	
	  If the problem persists after installing the latest version of DirectX,
	  contact your sound card manufacturer for the latest DirectX-compatible sound
	  drivers.
