	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0

	When you print a card from within Creative Writer 2, the print settings
	dialog box indicates that four (4) pages will print. However, only one
	page, the foldable card, will actually print.
	
	Creative Writer logically maps four (4) pages of graphics and text onto one
	(1) real page. Essentially, four pages are printed, reduced, and rotated as
	necessary onto one 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper. The print settings dialog
	box is reflecting the four pages mapped to the one foldable card page.
