	When you use a shortcut key combination to select a program that is already
	running, a new instance of the program may be started instead.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The process that determines whether a program is already running may not
	function properly if something (for example, another process) delays the
	process.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
