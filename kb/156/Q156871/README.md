## Q156871: DOCERR: Visual FoxPro 5.0 AFIELDS() Remark Help Topic Outdated

{% raw %}

	Article: Q156871
	Product(s): Microsoft FoxPro
	Version(s): WINDOWS:5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 14-DEC-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The first paragraph of the Remarks section of the Help topic "AFIELDS()"
	describes the array generated by the AFIELDS() function as containing 11 columns
	and as many rows as there are fields in the table. The correct number of columns
	for Visual FoxPro 5.0 is 16.
	
	The statement in the Remarks section is a duplicate of the Help topic paragraph
	found in Visual FoxPro version 3.0b. However, it contradicts the information in
	the Arguments section of the AFIELDS() topic, which describes the elements of
	the array.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The AFIELDS() function of Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows provides more
	information about the structure of a table than was available previously. The
	resulting array contains five additional columns recording the following:
	
	  Column 12 - the long file name of the table
	  Column 13 - any 'Insert' trigger expression
	  Column 14 - any 'Update' trigger expression
	  Column 15 - any 'Delete' trigger expression
	  Column 16 - any table comment
	
	Additional query words: kbdsd VFoxWin
