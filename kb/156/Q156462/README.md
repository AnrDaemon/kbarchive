	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When creating web pages within Creative Writer, you may choose from the standard
	set of point sizes, including "Other Size." Only seven levels of character sizes
	are allowable in HTML. Regardless of the point sizes chosen within your web
	document, once the document is converted to an HTML document, the character
	point sizes are converted into one of the seven standard character sizes for
	HTML.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The web page creation wizard utilizes the same interface as the normal Creative
	Writer word processor. For this reason, all point sizes appear within the
	drop-down list.
	
	NOTE: It is helpful to be aware of HTML standards such as the seven allowable
	point sizes to understand the apparent discrepancies between your created
	document and your HTML document.
