	When you start Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition, the game menus may not be visible on
	the screen.
	
	CAUSE

	This behavior can occur if your monitor is unable to switch to a screen
	resolution of 800 x 600 pixels with an acceptable refresh rate.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are

	2. Double-click Display.
	
	3. On the Settings tab, note the current settings.

	Change the Refresh Rate for Your Video Adapter

	  If you are using Microsoft Windows 98, click Advanced on the Settings tab.
	
	4. Click the Adapter tab.
	
	  If you do not see an Adapter tab, you cannot change the refresh rate for your
	  video adapter.
	
	5. On the Adapter tab, click Adapter Default in the Refresh Rate box, and then
	  click OK.
	
	  If you are prompted to test the setting, click OK.
	
	6. If the setting appears to function properly, click Yes.
	
	  If the setting does not function properly, click No, and then repeat step 5 to
	  select a different refresh rate.
