## Q271960: XADM: Address Book Search Takes Longer Than Expected

	Article: Q271960
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:5.5

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Check Names option in an e-mail client to verify a recipient's
	name, Exchange Server searches the appropriate address list and returns the
	correct name, but the search may take longer than expected. In particular, if
	Exchange Server performs the same search multiple times, subsequent searches may
	take as long as the first search. Because Exchange Server caches the search
	criteria used during an address list search, you expect subsequent searches to
	take less time than the first.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue occurs when the information store is unable to determine that the
	current search criteria has already been cached by the Exchange Server database
	engine because the Exchange Server database engine has not sorted the index in
	the manner that the information store expects.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
