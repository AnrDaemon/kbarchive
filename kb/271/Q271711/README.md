	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a mailbox that contains an autoforward rule attempts to process the rule,
	if a message contains an attachment and the server uses a program that is based
	on the antivirus application programming interface (API), the information store
	may disable the autoforward rule.
	
	The client receives a "Rule In Error" error message that lists the name of the
	rule with the reason "Unknown Error."
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue can occur because the antivirus API scans any attachments.
	
	If the information store does not detect this condition when the attachment is
	being scanned, the information store disables the rule.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
	For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base:

	NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
	databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
	been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
	server, but only if it is version 5.5.2652.68 or later. If you restore a
	Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2652.68 after the database has been
	upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
