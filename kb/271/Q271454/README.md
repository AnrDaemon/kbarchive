	Encarta Language Learning program needs to run.
	
	NOTE: This issue only occurs when you uninstall Encarta Reference Suite 2001.
	
	If you uninstall the component products of Encarta Reference Suite 2001 or a

	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, uninstall and then reinstall the Encarta Language
	Learning program.
