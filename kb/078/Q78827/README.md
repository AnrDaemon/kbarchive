	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc. has marketed two versions of the 9600
	V-series modem. There are no physical differences between the two versions; they
	are identical except that the newer version contains additional speed checking
	capabilities. This additional capability is called Automatic Speed Buffering.
	
	You can determine the difference between the two versions by looking at the model
	sticker on the bottom of the modem. Earlier versions are marked as 215AA; later
	versions are marked as 1000US.
