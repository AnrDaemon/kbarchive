	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500C color inkjet printer prints color
	documents more slowly than it prints black-and-white documents. The changes made
	to Microsoft Windows version 3.1 to allow faster printing may increase the speed
	of color printing, but the listed speed rates will generally apply.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	According to the "New HP DeskJet 500C Printer Product Brief" from
	Hewlett-Packard, operating the printer in Best Mode for color operation will
	result in a print speed of 7 minutes per page. The following information details
	the various print speeds available on the 500C:
	
	  Black Print Speed               Windows Color Print Speed
	  -----------------               -------------------------
	  Letter quality: 167 cps         Best Mode: 7 minutes per page (mpp)
	  Draft quality: 240 cps          Normal Mode: 4 mpp
	  Up to 3 pages/minute (draft)    Draft Mode: 3 mpp
	
	Color mode takes so much longer than black-and-white mode because three passes
	must be made for each line in color mode as opposed to one pass per line in
	black-and-white mode.
	
	The HP DeskJet 500C is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
	no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
