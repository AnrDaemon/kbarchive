	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You may need to upgrade your computer ROM BIOS before installing MS-DOS 5.0 or
	later. The reasons vary from machine to machine, but they typically involve a
	bug or incompatibility in the existing ROM BIOS. In such cases, your previous
	MS-DOS version works because that version works around the bug (usually in OEM
	specific versions of MS-DOS) or because the previous version of MS-DOS did not
	require the functionality that is missing or incompatible.
