	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows Help Compiler version 3.1 no longer supports the "side-by- side"
	paragraph format provided by Microsoft Word for MS-DOS and Microsoft Word for
	the Macintosh. This format was used in files compiled by version 3.0 of the
	Windows Help Compiler to create multiple columns of information.
	
	To create multiple columns in a file compiled with version 3.1 of the Help
	Compiler, use the Table feature provided by Microsoft Word for Windows.
	
	Help files that are authored using side-by-side paragraphs and compiled using
	version 3.0 of the Help Compiler will continue to be supported using version 3.1
	of Windows Help (the help file viewer).
