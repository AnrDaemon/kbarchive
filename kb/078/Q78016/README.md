	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The illustration on page B-6 of the MediaVision manual "Introducing
	Windows with Multimedia Version 1.0" shows the media player playing an
	animation file, in this case PHASES.MMM. There is no device driver for
	animation supplied with Windows with Multimedia Extensions. The driver
	is called MCI Movie Player, as shown on page C-5 of the MediaVision
	manual "Introducing Windows with Multimedia Version 1.0." This driver
	does not appear in the actual Windows with Multimedia Extensions
	program.
	
	There is an animation player in the Multimedia Development Kit (MDK).
	Developers should be advised of this.
