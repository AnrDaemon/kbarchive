	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Norton Desktop for Windows version 1.0 may inhibit Microsoft Windows 3.0 from
	printing due to a full TRASHCAN directory.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The TRASHCAN directory is created and used by Norton Desktop to store deleted
	files, which makes it easier to restore files if needed. If there is not enough
	free hard disk space, printing may be affected. Erasing the files in this
	directory will restore free space needed for Windows 3.0 to print.
	
	For more information, contact Symantec.
