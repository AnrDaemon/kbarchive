	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Roland driver that ships with Windows with Multimedia Extensions
	is a MIDI driver, not a sound driver. Because this driver is a MIDI
	driver, it does not offer sound support, such as the playing of wave
	(.WAV) files.
	
	The driver also does not show up under the initial setup of Windows
	under Sound Board options. This driver can only be manipulated by
	using Control Panel's Driver icon.
