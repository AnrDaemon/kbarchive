	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	According to NEC, MS-DOS 5.0 and later do not work on the NEC PowerMate 80286
	APC4. The APC4 is an old machine that was designed to run MS-DOS versions up to
	and including version 3.2.
	
	NOTE: Some customers have been able to get MS-DOS 5.0 and later to work on the
	APC4 by upgrading their BIOS to version 3.07. However, NEC does not support this
	setup because it is may not be stable.
