	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Manufacturers of new computer systems can sell a full retail version of
	Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 to their customers after becoming a Microsoft original
	equipment manufacturer (OEM) for MS-DOS 5.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The only requirement for a manufacturer to become an MS-DOS 5.0 OEM is for the
	company to agree to purchase a minimum of 30 packages of MS-DOS 5.0 within a
	period of 1 year. An OEM can bundle a full version of MS-DOS 5.0 with each new
	computer sold.
	
	For more information, call the Microsoft OEM Sales group at (425) 882-8080.
	
	Dealers cannot sell the full retail version of MS-DOS 5.0 at this time. Dealers
	are only allowed to sell the MS-DOS 5 Upgrade, which requires a previous version
	of DOS to install. Plans to market the full retail version of MS-DOS 5.0 through
	dealers have been announced in an article by Bill Gates, published in Issue 14,
	1991 of Microsoft's One on One magazine. However, no product release date has
	been announced yet.
