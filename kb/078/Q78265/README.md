	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you select the Olivetti/AT&T Monochrome or PVC Display in Windows Setup
	(from the Options menu choose Change System Settings) and you load the Microsoft
	Mouse driver version 7.04, Microsoft Windows version 3.0 does not run in
	standard mode on a Toshiba T1200XE laptop computer.
	
	This problem occurs in Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and 3.0a. It does not occur
	in later versions of Windows.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To use standard mode while the version 7.04 driver is being used, select either
	the CGA or COMPAQ Portable Plasma display depending on the resolution required.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Toshiba T1200XE accepts several different screen choices, including CGA
	COMPAQ Portable Plasma, and Olivetti/AT&T Monochrome or PVC Display. All of
	these choices work with real mode while the Microsoft Mouse driver version 7.04
	is loaded.
	
	The COMPAQ Portable Plasma display choice is recommended by Toshiba and gives the
	best resolution. For more information, contact Toshiba technical support.
