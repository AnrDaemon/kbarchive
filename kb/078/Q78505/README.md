	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When using the BACKUP.EXE utility from MS-DOS versions 3.x or earlier, a single
	short beep will occur before the message warning that the target drive will be
	erased. With MS-DOS versions 4.x and later, there is no beep before the warning
	message is displayed. This is by design.
