	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use Notepad in Microsoft Windows, you can remove and/or change headers
	and footers. The default header and footer settings in Notepad are as follows:
	
	  Headers: &f
	  Footers: Page &p
	
	These commands give you the title of the document on the top of the page and a
	page number at the bottom.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	All header and footer setting must be entered manually each time you want to
	print a document. These settings cannot be saved.
	
	To change headers and footers, choose Page Setup from the File menu and enter the
	desired command(s) in the Header and Footer text boxes. The following is a short
	list of header and footer commands:
	
	  Command   Action
	  -------   --------------------------------------
	
	  &l        Left-align the characters that follow
	  &c        Center the characters that follow
	  &r        Right-align the characters that follow
	  &d        Print the current date
	  &t        Print the current time
	  &f        Print the name of the document
	  &p        Print the page number
	
	If you leave the Header or Footer text box empty, no header or footer will print.
	You can also insert words into the Header and Footer text box and they will
	print in their appropriate position. Letters after the "&" sign do not have
	to be capitalized.
	
	In Notepad, your header is centered, regardless of the formatting codes you use,
	if the formatting code is not the first item in the Header text box. For
	example, to align a title to the left side of the page, use "&lTitle text"
	(without the quotation marks).
