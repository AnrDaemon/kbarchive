	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) with Internet Explorer 5.x or an earlier
	version of a browser such as Internet Explorer 4.x or Netscape Navigator 4.x,
	and you create an appointment that occurs in the past, a warning message that
	alerts the user of the error is not displayed. However, when you use an Outlook
	client to create an appointment that occurs in the past, a warning message is
	displayed.
	
	This issue may enable users to create appointments for past dates and times by
	accident.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To avoid creating appointments that occur in the past, verify that you have
	entered the correct date and time on the New Appointment form before you save
	the appointment.
