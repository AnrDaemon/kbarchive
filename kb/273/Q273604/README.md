	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the automatic save game feature in Microsoft Golf 2001
	Edition and Microsoft Links 2001.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you play Golf 2001 Edition or Links 2001, the program automatically saves
	the current game in the Lastgame file.
	
	If a Lastgame file already exists on your computer, Golf 2001 Edition or Links
	2001 renames the Lastgame file to the Oldlast file, and then creates a new
	Lastgame file.
	
	If the game stops responding (hangs) or quits unexpectedly, the next time you
	start the game you are prompted to resume the interrupted game.
	
	If you click Yes, the Lastgame file is used to start the game.
	
	If you click No, a new game starts.
	
	If you click No, but you want to resume the interrupted game, use the appropriate
	method for your game.
