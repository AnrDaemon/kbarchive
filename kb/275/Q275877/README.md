	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) is
	included with Microsoft BackOffice Server version 4.5. However, you need SMS
	Service Pack 2 (SP2) to install SMS 2.0 on a computer that is running Microsoft
	Windows 2000 or later.
	
	Microsoft provides the SMS SP2 on its Web site and FTP locations. The
	installation process for the online update is to apply the patch to the original
	SMS source by using the downloaded service pack. For additional information,

	However, to apply the service patch to the BackOffice Server 4.5 SMS source, you
	need the SP2 CD-ROM because you are unable to use the service pack that you can
	download online.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft provides the Readiness Kit for Windows 2000, which contains necessary
	service pack software and online documentation for upgrading BackOffice Server
	4.5 to Windows 2000 Server, and for freshly installing BackOffice Server 4.5
	onto an existing Windows 2000 server.
	
	Note: SMS 2.0 with SP2 is not included with the BackOffice Server 4.5 Readiness
	Kit for Windows 2000. If you plan to use SMS on your BackOffice Server 4.5
	computer, a full installation of SMS 2.0 with SP2 is required for completing
	these steps. You can order this by phone. To order a full installation of
	Systems Management Server 2.0 SP2, call (800) 329-9015 (U.S. and Canadian
	customers only).
