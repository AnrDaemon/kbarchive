	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains some helpful tips and suggestions for how to fly training
	missions in Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To successfully complete a training mission in Combat Flight Simulator 2:
	
	- Follow the Instructor Carefully
	
	  Some maneuvers may take longer than expected.
	
	- Use the Default Aircraft to Fly Training Missions
	
	  Aircraft characteristics may vary.
	
	  The American default aircraft is the Corsair. The Japanese default aircraft is
	  the Zero.
	
	- Japanese Training Mission 05
	
	  The text that explains that you must invert for the "Split S" maneuver does
	  not appear until you complete the maneuver.
	
	- Japanese Training Mission 06
	
	  There is a conflict between two audio tracks. A report of bandits in your
	  sector and the instructor's voice are played at the same time. The bandit
	  report may not be audible.
	
	- American and Japanese Training Mission 10
	
	  The "Show Maneuver" video clip depicts the aircraft making an approach that
	  does not reflect the description that is portrayed in the training mission.
	  This training mission is a straight-in approach, not a traffic pattern
	  approach.
