	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have installed Remote Access Service (RAS) but disabled it in the current
	hardware profile, certain programs (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or
	Mobsync.exe) may generate an access violation when they call a RAS function.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The RAS RasEnumEntries function cannot properly handle situations in which RAS
	is installed but disabled.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
