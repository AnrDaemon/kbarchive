	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The option to create a shared SQL Server repository in Visual Component Manager
	is unavailable in the Professional Edition of Visual Basic 6.0.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This feature is only available in the version of Visual Component Manager that
	ships with the Enterprise Edition of Visual Basic 6.0. You cannot use the
	version of Visual Component Manager that ships with the Professional Edition of
	Visual Basic 6.0 to create shared SQL Server repositories.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, upgrade to the Enterprise Edition of Visual Basic 6.0.
	
	NOTE: When you upgrade to the Enterprise Edition of Visual Basic 6.0, you must
	install the Enterprise Edition from scratch. There is no update patch that you
	can apply to add on the Enterprise Edition features to the Professional Edition.
	It is recommended that you completely uninstall the Professional Edition before
	you install the Enterprise Edition.
