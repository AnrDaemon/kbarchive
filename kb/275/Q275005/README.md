	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article lists the new features that are included in Microsoft Combat Flight
	Simulator 2.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The new features that are included in Combat Flight Simulator 2 are:
	
	- New Battle Sites
	
	  Beautifully rendered battle sites such as Papua New Guinea, the Marianas, the
	  Gilberts, and Midway capture historical scenes in vivid detail, from jungle
	  hillsides to coral reefs.
	
	- Mission Builder
	
	  Fly challenging single missions and full-fledged campaigns where your skill
	  determines your fate - and that of your wingmen. Use the powerful new
	  graphical Mission Builder to re-create other famous conflicts and "what-if"
	  campaigns where the challenges change each time you take off into battle.
	
	- History Takes Wing
	
	  These aircraft, the pride of the Japanese and American fleets, made history.
	  Now make them yours. Microsoft's leading graphics technology brilliantly
	  captures classic WWII naval fighters. Choose from the American P-38F
	  Lightning, the F4F-4 Wildcat, the F6F-3 Hellcat, and the F4U-1A Corsair or
	  the Japanese A6M2 Zero, the A6M5 Zero, and the NiK2 George. Bid today goodbye
	  as you fly off into history. More choices to fly and new challenges to
	  master. All the new aircraft look and sound even more realistic than
	  Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1.
	
	- The Real Story, Straight from the Source
	
	  Combat Flight Simulator 2 builds on a tradition of more than 18 years of
	  creating compelling flight simulations. Veteran World War II pilots from both
	  sides of the Pacific conflict helped make every detail, from the roar of
	  engines to radio chatter, come to life. Read their stories in the Pilot's
	  Manual, and then test their battle-proven tactics for yourself. Realistic and
	  stunning visuals.
	
	- Enhanced Depth of Play
	
	  Combat Flight Simulator 2 engages you at heightened new level of game play.
	  Your actions in the game now have real consequences - lose a wingman in
	  battle and his replacement may not be the ace that you hoped for. Campaigns
	  are a branching tree structure. You have to try and survive, not lose too
	  many wingmen, complete your mission goals and earn medals and promotions, and
	  fly increasingly higher-performance aircraft. Failing to perform will result
	  in your early retirement. You will be able to enter the campaign at any of 10
	  different historical points. Real-life action and game play immerse you into
	  the era.
	
	- Fight the Pacific War for Either Flag
	
	  You're a 20-year-old farm boy from Nebraska, engaging the Japanese with a 2000
	  horsepower fighter bristling with firepower. Or a veteran Japanese pilot at
	  the controls of a deadly and agile Zero, determined to protect your fleet.
	  Experience the war from both sides of the battle.
	
	- Enhanced Visuals
	
	  Combat Flight Simulator 2 features enhanced 3-D objects and aircraft models,
	  cockpits, explosions, splashes, waves and wakes, and many other effects.
	  High-resolution terrain with detailed roads, rivers, coastlines, and atolls
	  will bring this area of the world to life. Take off and land from the
	  aircraft carriers Essex, Enterprise, Junyo, and Hiryu. A Landing Signal
	  Officer will get you back on deck. Combat Flight Simulator 2 contains
	  incredible realism.
	
	- Updated and Improved Weather System
	
	  You can download current weather conditions and forecast winds aloft from a
	  Microsoft server on Zone.com. The new weather system also dramatically
	  improves the variety of weather as you fly and the effects you see, such as
	  clouds, precipitation, lightning, and more. Customize realistic weather or
	  fly in real-time conditions using the Internet!
	
	- New Level of Realism
	
	  Details such as moving canopies, folding wings, battle-scarred paint,
	  spectacular damage, and last-second bailouts immerse you in a new level of
	  realism.
	
	- Talk Strategy with Your Teammates
	
	  Talk trash to your opponents. Control your game with voice commands.
	  Communicate in mid-air with GameVoice!
	
	- Two new movie trailers for Combat Flight Simulator 2
