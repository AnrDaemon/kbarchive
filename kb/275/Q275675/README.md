	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create a New Season or a Playoff in Microsoft NFL Fever 2000 and you
	right-click the Sports Pages screen, a description of the following four tabs is
	displayed:
	
	- Brackets
	- Leaders
	- Schedule

	The Leaders tab was removed from the game before the program was released, but
	the description was inadvertently left in the game.
