	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you send villagers to construct a building in Microsoft Age of Empires, the
	villagers may stand in the building foundation and do nothing.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions is true:
	
	- A new villager who is created by a Town Center is directed to a gather point
	  that is placed on an abandoned foundation.
	
	- A villager who is instructed to start a building is redirected after the
	  foundation is placed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To prevent this issue from occurring, do not place gather points in building
	foundations.
