	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If two or more clients on a Terminal Server attempt to gain access to a resource
	on a remote server by using a Microsoft distributed file system (Dfs) junction
	point, the terminal server may stop responding (hang).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	A deadlock can occur between the Dfs client and the redirector on a Terminal
	Server if two clients on the same Terminal Server try to gain access to the same
	remote Dfs resource at the same time.
