	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MapPoint 2002 
	- Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
	- Microsoft Streets & Trips 2002, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you print a map from one of the programs listed at the beginning of this
	article to a printer that you configured to print in portrait orientation, the
	printed map may not fill the entire page.
	
	In Microsoft MapPoint 2001 and Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001, only the area of
	the map that is visible on the screen is printed to preserve the proportions of
	the map that is visible on the screen. As a result, the printed map may not fill
	the entire page.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To work around this issue resize the program window so that the map is displayed
	twice as tall as it is wide, and then print the map in Portrait view.
	
	When you print a map, MapPoint 2001 and Streets and Trips 2001 use the same
	height and width ratio that is displayed on the screen.
	
	Previous versions of both MapPoint and Streets and Trips printed areas of the map
	that extended beyond the edges of the screen to ensure that the printed map
	filled the entire page.
	
	MapPoint 2002 and Streets & Trips 2002 are designed to print by default a
	landscape. If a Portrait map is needed, use the process outlined above for
	Streets & Trips 2001 and MapPoint 2001.
