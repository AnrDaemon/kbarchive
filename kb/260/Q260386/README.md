	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	CIH is a virus that infects 32-bit program files in Microsoft Windows 95,
	Microsoft Windows 98, and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, but can only function in
	Windows 95 or Windows 98.
	
	When an infected program is started on a Windows 95-based or a Windows 98-based
	computer, the CIH virus becomes resident in the computer's memory.
