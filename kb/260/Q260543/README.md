	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In January 2000, the State of Georgia started to renumber the exits on all of
	the Interstate highways within the state.
	
	The exit numbering system has changed from a sequential numbering system, in
	which exit numbers increase in sequential order from south to north, to a mile
	log numbering system, in which exit numbers correspond to mileposts on the
	highway.
	
	The following Interstate highways are affected by this change:
	
	- I-16
	- I-20
	- I-24
	- I-59
	- I-75
	- I-85
	- I-95
	- I-185
	- I-285
	- I-475
	- I-516
	- I-520
	- I-575
	- I-675
	- I-985
