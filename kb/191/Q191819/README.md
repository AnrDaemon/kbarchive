	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to gain access to a network resource on your Novell NetWare network
	that requires a password that your login script already provided, you may still
	be prompted for your password. Note that this behavior may occur even if you
	enter the password information and then click the Save This Password check box
	to select it.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because passwords for attached NetWare resources are not
	cached unless they are the same as the password for the preferred server.
