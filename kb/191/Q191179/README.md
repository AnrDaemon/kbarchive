	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to create a custom toolbar, how to distribute it to
	other users, and how to allow other users to share it over a network.
	
	The built-in toolbars provided by Microsoft Word cannot be changed or replaced
	because they are stored as Microsoft Word program code. However, you can create
	custom toolbars, save them in templates, and then do any of the following:
	
	- Send those templates for other people to use.
	
	- Copy the toolbars into the Normal template.
	
	- Place the templates in a folder so they can be shared globally and used
	  automatically by Microsoft Word.
	
	Custom toolbars are stored in templates or documents. You can use the organizer
	to copy toolbars between templates or documents.
