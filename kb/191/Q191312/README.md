	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view your computer's system devices or video adapter in Device Manager,
	you may see a red X through a device's icon, or an exclamation point in a yellow
	circle next to the device's icon. Note that this may occur even if all of your
	computer's devices are working correctly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue can occur if you are using an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) video
	adapter. Because Windows 95 was developed prior to AGP video technology, AGP
	video adapters may cause resource conflicts to appear in Device Manager.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	These types of resource conflicts do not normally affect your computer's
	functionality.
