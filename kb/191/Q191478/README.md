	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The implementation of the Windows CE 2.0 operating system on the Palm-size PC
	1.0 devices does not include sufficient COM support for Windows CE Toolkit for
	Visual Basic 6.0 (VBCE) applications. However, the Palm-size PC devices running
	the Windows CE operating system 2.11 do provide support for VBCE applications.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 (VBCE6) can create applications for
	the following classes of devices:
	
	- Handheld PC (H/PC - running Windows CE 2.0)
	
	- Handheld PC Pro (H/PC Pro - running Windows CE 2.1x)
	
	- Palm-size PC (PPC - running Windows CE 2.1x)
	
	Please note that the implementation of the Windows CE operating system 2.0 on the
