	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If Crystal Reports 4.5 is installed on a Terminal Server, only one user will be
	able to access the program at a time. This is because of licensing restrictions
	in Crystal Reports, which is currently sold as a single-user product only. To
	run this product for multiple users on Terminal Server, administrators need to
	install a separate, licensed copy of Crystal Reports for each user.
