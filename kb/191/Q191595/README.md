	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Every version of Outlook (from the original retail Office 97 version to the
	Outlook clients included with Exchange Server 5.5) works with every version of
	Exchange Server from 4.0 to 5.5. However, to take advantage of Outlook and
	Exchange client features specific to your version of Exchange Server, it is
	recommended that you use the version of Outlook or the Exchange client that came
	with that Exchange Server version.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	IMPORTANT: If you use Office 97, the Exchange Server Support component does not
	install by default when you choose the typical option during setup. To install
	the Exchange Server Support component, choose Custom instead.
	
	Users of the Office 97 version will not see a version number for Outlook on the
	Help About screen.
	
	Even though the Office 97 Service Release 1 downloadable patch changes the
	Outlook version to 8.02, it does not install the updated Exchange Server
	components to give Exchange Server Service Pack 1 (SP1) features. If you need
	the features or fixes in SP1, you have several alternatives:
	
	- Install Outlook 8.01, and then install the 8.02 patch from SP1.
	
	-or-
	
	- Order and install the Office 97 release 1 Enterprise Update.
	
	-or-
	
	- Use a recent retail version of Office 97; the version with the MMX sticker on
	  the box is the same as the Enterprise Update.
	
	-or-
	
	- Download and install Outlook 8.03 from SP2.
