	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to use Pinpointer or Word Search to search for articles in
	Encarta Encyclopedia, Encarta may not find some of the words you type in the
	search box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur for the following reasons:
	
	- To improve search performance and results, Encarta ignores common
	  prepositions and pronouns in Word Search queries.
	
	- Encarta uses the words "and," "or," "not," and "thru" for special search
	  functions when you type them without quotation marks. Encarta ignores these
	  words when you type them within quotation marks.

	Search Tips
	-----------
	
	When you perform a Word Search in Encarta, you can use the following words to
	modify the results of your search:
	
	  Word   Usage      Purpose
	  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	  And    X And Y    Find articles that contain both X and Y.
	
	  Or     X Or Y     Find articles that contain either X or Y or both.
	
	  Near   X Near Y   Find articles that contain both X and Y within eight
	                    words of each other.
	
	  Not    X Not Y    Find articles that contain X and do not contain Y.
	
	  Thru   X Thru Y   Find articles that contain X, Y, or any word that
	                    falls alphabetically between X and Y.
	
	  NOTE: When you use "Thru" in a Word Search in Encarta, you may have to wait a
	  long time before Encarta returns the search results.
