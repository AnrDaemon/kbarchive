	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to increase the level of difficulty in a
	single-player game of Microsoft Motocross Madness.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To increase the level of difficulty in a single-player game of Motocross
	Madness, disable the Automatic Level Of Difficulty (ALOD) feature.
	
	The ALOD feature is designed to limit the Artificial Intelligence (AI) of
	computer-generated opponents. This feature is enabled by default when you start
	the game.
	
	To disable the ALOD feature, press CTRL+A. When you do this, a PLUS SIGN (+) is
	displayed briefly in the lower-left corner of the screen. To reenable ALOD,
	press CTRL+A again. When you do this, a MINUS SIGN (-) is displayed briefly in
	the lower-left corner of the screen.
	
	Enabling ALOD slows down computer-generated opponents when they are too far ahead
	of you. Conversely, disabling ALOD increases the skill of computer-generated
	opponents, making them more difficult for you to lap.
