	Article: Q191387
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): WinNT:4.0
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Window NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) may not allow 16-bit applications to run
	after installing Windows NT on a computer where the previous operating system
	had a parameter of FILES=255 or greater in Config.sys file.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows NT copies the FILES= value from the Config.sys file into the Config.nt
	file during setup. Any value for FILES= greater than 255 copied into Config.nt
	will prevent 16-bit applications from starting.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
