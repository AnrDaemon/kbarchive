	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Details window of a Run Command On Workstation job contains an option for
	"Not Mandatory Over Slow Link" to prevent mandatory installation of a package
	over a slow link. However, the functionality was not implemented in Systems
	Management 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2, so consequently the option has no effect on package
	execution.
	
	The option "Not Mandatory Over Slow Link" has been removed from Systems
	Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
	Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
	pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
