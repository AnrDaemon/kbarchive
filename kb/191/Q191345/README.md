	If you have more than one MIF form present on the client computer, the MIF
	Entry program will list these in alphabetical order of their respective
	form name. This is not to be confused with the name of the physical MIF
	form, but the logical name that is specified from within the MIF Form
	Generator. The default MIF form that will be shown after starting the MIF
	Entry program is the one with the Form Name that would be listed first in
	the order of the alphabet. For example, the form "Printer Information"
	would be listed by default instead of "User Information".
