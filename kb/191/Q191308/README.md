	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	An access violation may occur when you attempt to convert a W3C extended log
	file to any other log file format.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Convlog is reading less than the full log line for parsing, so the remaining
	part of the line is being treating as a separate log entry.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
	version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
	and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The fix increases the read buffer to the same length as the maximum size of a
	log line.
