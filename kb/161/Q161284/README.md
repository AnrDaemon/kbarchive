	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Undoing a grouping of the 32nd linked text box to an object causes Word to hang
	(stop responding).
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Method 1: Do not Undo
	---------------------
	
	Use the ungroup feature, instead. Right-click the grouped object, point to
	Grouping on the shortcut menu, and then click Ungroup.
	
	Method 2: Do not group to the 32nd text box
	-------------------------------------------
	
	Do not group an object with the 32nd text box in a sequence. This also includes
	every 32nd instance of a text box in linked sequences. For example, do not group
	to the 32nd text box, the 64th text box, the 96th text box, and so forth in
	linked sequences.
