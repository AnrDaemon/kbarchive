	Article: Q161651
	Product(s): Microsoft Systems Management Server
	Version(s): winnt:1.2
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbSNMP smssnmpkbfixlist

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the SNMP Event Log Extension Agent is installed, the following event is
	logged in the Windows NT Server Application Event Log:
	
	     Event ID 2018
	     Description: "SNMP Event Log Extension Agent is starting Version Beta 2;
	     build 13."
	
	This message occurs even though the service is the Systems Management Server 1.2
	release version. This is a cosmetic problem, and can be ignored.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
	Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
	the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
