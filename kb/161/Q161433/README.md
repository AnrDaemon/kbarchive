	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Low-resolution courses have a .crs file extension and high-resolution courses
	have a .crh file extension. When the course conversion completes, a new file
	with a .crh file extension is created in your MSGOLF 3.0 folder. The Course
	Converter does not delete the low resolution course that was converted; you can
	delete the original course file after you convert the course files.
