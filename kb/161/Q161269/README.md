	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you go the Online Library in Encarta Encyclopedia and click the Connect To
	Online Library button, either nothing happens or you hear a Windows message
	sound, but do not see a message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Microsoft Internet Explorer is not set to be your default browser. A message
	appears stating the following:
	
	  Internet Explorer is not currently your default browser. Would you like to
	  make it your default browser?
	
	However, this message flashes so quickly you cannot read it, and then it
	disappears behind Encarta.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You need to set Internet Explorer as your default browser. Minimize Encarta or
	switch to the message, and then select Yes to set your default browser as
	Internet Explorer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia,
	1997 edition. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
