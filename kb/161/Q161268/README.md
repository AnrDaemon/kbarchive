	You receive the following error message when you attempt to download an Encarta
	Encyclopedia Yearbook Update:
	
	  Enc97 failed to load Encres97.dll.
	
	When you click OK, you receive the following message:
	
	  No new update files were found. Do you want Encarta Encyclopedia to search
	  your hard drive for updates?
	
	When you click OK, you receive the following message:
	
	  You are out of disk space or do not have permission to write to the drive.
	  Unable to complete integration.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You do not have enough free space available on your hard disk.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Make sure you have at least 20 megabytes (MB) of available hard disk space
	before you attempt to download the Encarta Encyclopedia Updates again.
	
	For more information about making room on your hard drive, see your Windows
	printed documentation or online Help.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior is by design. The system requirements for Encarta Encyclopedia
	state that 4 MB of free hard disk space is required to download an update and an
	additional 1 MB of disk space is needed for the actual update.
