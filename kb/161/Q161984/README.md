	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word, the following statement in Help may be misleading:
	
	  If you always save documents in a different format, for example, if you
	  need to share documents with coworkers who are using a previous version
	  of Office, you can change the default file format Word uses to save
	  documents.
	
	This statement applies only to new documents that you save in Word. If you open
	an existing document, Word detects the document format. When you save the
	document, Word retains that existing format, unless you specifically change the
	"Save as type" option in the Save As dialog box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The "Save Word files as" option is used to set the default format that Word will
	use each time you save a new document. However, changing the "Save Word files
	as" option has no effect on the format Word uses to save existing documents.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
	beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================

	1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Save tab.
	
	2. Change the "Save Word files as" option to the desired format, and then click
	  OK.
