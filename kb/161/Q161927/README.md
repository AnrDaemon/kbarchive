	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Newprof.exe to create multiple profiles on a single computer
	running Windows 3.x, the computer generates a general protection fault (GPF) in
	Mapi.dll after approximately 10 profiles have been created. This problem only
	happens if Word for Windows 6.x is running at the same time Newprof.exe is
	running.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange client
	version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
