	The text in Cinemania 97 appears corrupt or garbled on an IBM Thinkpad. This
	occurs if you are using a Cyber9320 display driver.
	
	You may also experience this behavior in other programs after you exit
	Cinemania.
	
	NOTE: Rebooting the computer resolves the problem until Cinemania is launched
	again.
