	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you manually install a driver for the D-Link DE-220 ISA Ethernet network
	adapter in Windows NT, you are prompted repeatedly for the Windows NT
	Workstation CD-ROM. Windows NT does not read from the CD-ROM drive even if the
	Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM is inserted.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Allow Windows NT to detect the network adapter instead of manually installing
	the driver.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
	Server 4.0. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
