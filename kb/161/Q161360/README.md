	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	According to Visual FoxPro Help, the UpClick and DownClick events apply to
	ComboBox, ListBox, and Spinner controls. However, the ListBox control no longer
	has either event.
	
	The "Language Reference" manual also contains the same error. On both page 157
	and page 429, the "Applies To" section of DownClick event and UpClick event
	erroneously includes the ListBox object.
