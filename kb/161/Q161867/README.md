## Q161867: Arrow Keys Not Functioning Properly in the Hardware Profile Menu

	Article: Q161867
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 4.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If more than one hardware profile is present on the system and the UP ARROW or
	DOWN ARROW key is pressed before the Hardware Profile menu is displayed on the
	screen, the arrow keys may not function properly, and will appear to be out of
	synchronization.
	
	For example, pressing the DOWN ARROW key once does not change the selected
	profile; pressing the UP ARROW key once results in the selection moving down;
	pressing The DOWN ARROW key twice results in the selection moving down only one
	item, and so on.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Wait for the Hardware Profile screen to be displayed before selecting the option
	you want.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
