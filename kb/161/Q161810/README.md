	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some of the fonts that appeared at the top of the Font list (on the Formatting
	toolbar) fail to reappear when you restart Word.
	
	NOTE: In earlier versions of Word, the list of fonts at the top of the Font list
	[called the "Most Recently Used" (MRU) Font list] includes the last six fonts
	you used. This list is retained when you exit Word. The MRU Font list is
	comprised of any font used in a document--including TrueType fonts, screen
	fonts, and printer fonts.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you restart Word, only the fonts that are used in the predefined styles for
	Word are listed.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
	
	This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 2000.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word uses the following fonts for its default styles, and, as a
	result, only these fonts are retained at the top of the Font list:
	
	  Arial
	  Courier New
	  Tahoma
	  Times New Roman
	
	Additional query words: built-in built in
