	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194543.
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In order to take advantage of the full functionality of FrontPage, you need to
	use a Web server. The FrontPage compact disc comes with two Web servers:
	
	- FrontPage Personal Web Server
	
	- Microsoft Personal Web Server
	
	When to Install the FrontPage Personal Web Server
	-------------------------------------------------
	
	If you install a later version of FrontPage on a system where FrontPage 1.1 is
	already installed, the installation procedure upgrades the FrontPage Personal
	Web Server and Server Extensions automatically.
	
	If FrontPage 1.1 was not installed on your system, please see the following
	article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about how to install the
	FrontPage Personal Web Server:

	When to Upgrade to the Microsoft Personal Web Server
	----------------------------------------------------
	
	If you want to write your own Common Gateway Interface (CGI), Internet Server
	Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), or Internet Database Connector (IDC)
	scripts or programs using the Microsoft Personal Web Server, you need to upgrade
	from the FrontPage Personal Web Server to the Microsoft Personal Web Server.
