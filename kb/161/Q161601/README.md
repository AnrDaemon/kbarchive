## Q161601: XADM: Public Folder Replication Set to Every 15 Minutes

	Article: Q161601
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you set the replication schedule for a public folder to Selected times,
	replication will begin at the start of the selected hour. When you change the
	detail view to 15 minutes, replication will occur every 15 minutes during the
	selected hour. This can cause a degradation in the performance of the Microsoft
	Exchange Server because replication occurs four times an hour instead of once.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5 of
	Microsoft Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
