## Q135146: McAfee Secure Station Clock Drawn Incorrectly

{% raw %}

	Article: Q135146
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the Application Manager included with McAfee Net Tools version 5.1
	as your Windows 95 shell, Secure Station Clock is not redrawn correctly and
	eventually fills up completely with black lines.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs only when Secure Station Clock is run with the McAfee
	Application Manager specified as the Windows 95 shell.
	
	McAfee Application Manager is a Windows 3.1-based program, and is not designed to
	run in Windows 95.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	McAfee does not recommend running Application Manager as the Windows 95 shell,
	as it is a Windows 3.1-based program. When you use Secure Station Clock in
	Windows 95 without using Application Manager as the shell, the problem does not
	occur.
