	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you change the default foreground and background colors in Paint and you
	click New on the File menu, the background color of the new file is the color
	you selected, but the color palette reverts to black and white.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Paint is designed to retain the selected color combination when you open a new
	file. If you prefer to maintain the white background, return to the default
	background before you open a new file.

	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
