	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) NS ARPA Services version C.00.00 allows LAN
	Manager 2.1 client computers to connect to an HP 3000 computer (with MPE
	operating system) running "Resource Sharing" version A.0.01.03. A PROBE
	protocol is used for communicating between the server and the client
	computers.
	
	To allow clients running either LAN Manager for MS-DOS or Windows for
	Workgroups and Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups to connect to
	the HP 3000 computer, upgrade to "Resource Sharing" version A.0.2.00. This
	supports the PROBE protocol and NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT). For more
	information, contact the HP Response Center at (800) 633-3600.
