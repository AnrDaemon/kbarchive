	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Oceans for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You cannot print Help information from Microsoft Oceans for Windows.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Because the Options dialog box replaces the Help dialog box, it is not possible
	to print Help screens.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Two of the items from the Oceans Help menu can be printed by printing the
	associated text file found in the root directory on the Oceans CD-ROM.
	
	The "Using the Options Menu" item can accessed by printing the Opthelp.txt file.
	The "Troubleshooting" item can be accessed by printing the Trouble.txt file. To
	print these text files, do the following:
	
	Windows 95:
	
	1. Open Windows Explorer and find the files.
	
	2. Double-click the file.
	
	3. On the File menu, click Print.
	
	Windows 3.x:
	
	1. Open File Manager, usually located in the Main program group and find the
	  files.
	
	2. Double-click the file.
	
	3. On the File menu, click Print.
	
	Other Help Printing Options
	---------------------------
	
	You can print the Using Microsoft Oceans help item and the About Microsoft Oceans
	help item by copying a screen image of the Window into a graphical editing
	program such as PaintBrush. To copy and print the screen image, do the
	following:
	
	1. Capture the entire Oceans Help topic to the Clipboard by pressing and
	  holding-down the ALT key while you press the PRINT SCREEN key (ALT+PRINT
	  SCREEN).
	
	2. Start Microsoft Paintbrush.
	
	3. Press and hold down the CTRL key while you press V (CTRl+V) to paste the
	  contents of the Clipboard into the Paintbrush window.
	
	  NOTE: It may be necessary to crop the screen image because the ALT+PRINT
	  SCREEN key combination copies the Help file selection plus other peripheral
	  graphics on the screen to the Clipboard. Use the Pick tool to crop the image,
	  adjust the picture size and eliminate unwanted screen elements.
	
	4. On the Paintbrush toolbar, click the Pick tool (crops) and select the Help
	  menu item selection from the entire image.
	
	5. On the Edit menu, click Cut.
	
	6. On the File menu, click New, and then click No when asked if you want to keep
	  current changes.
	
	7. On the Edit menu, click Paste. The cropped Help menu item appears.
	
	8. On the File menu, click Print, and then click OK.
