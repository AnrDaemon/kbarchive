	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you click a theme in the Desktop Themes tool in Control Panel, and then click
	Delete, the theme file is deleted and the next theme is loaded automatically.
	The newly loaded theme is called Current Windows Settings in the Theme box, even
	though it is not the current theme.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To fully remove an entire theme, use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control
	Panel.
	
	Using the Delete button in the Desktop Themes tool removes only the theme (.the)
	file for that theme, not the theme itself.
