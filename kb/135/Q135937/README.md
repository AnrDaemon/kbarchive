	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use DriveSpace 3 to compress a drive on a computer that had OS/2 or a
	Beta version of Windows 95 installed, DriveSpace 3 may change short filenames
	(8.3 filenames) to the Windows 95 format. The Windows 95 format omits spaces and
	places "~1" at the end of the filename.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	DriveSpace renames files to adhere to the default naming convention in Windows
	95.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can leave the files as they are named, or you can rename them to the
	original names.
