	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	"Mastering Microsoft Visual FoxPro" (MVFP) is a comprehensive computer- based
	training (CBT) tool for experienced database developers that includes narrated
	demonstrations. This product is not an introduction to database design,
	programming or the Xbase language. The lessons in this CBT assume some expertise
	in these areas.
	
	MVFP is an add-on sale in the Visual FoxPro 3.0 direct mailing. It is designed as
	a single-user product. It can be run over a network only if the appropriate
	number of client licenses have been purchased.
	
	It will be available internationally through an international Store-Keeping Unit
	(SKU), but it will not be localized.
	
	The content of the course applies to Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, with
	the exception of the information relating to OLE Automation. That is
	accomplished on the Macintosh using AppleScript.
	
	The course runs only on personal computers compatible with the System
	Requirements described in this article.
