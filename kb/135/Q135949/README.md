	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the Wizard feature in Microsoft Word version 6.0c for
	Windows, the mouse pointer may move erratically, or freeze. The problem may be
	worse if you are using a desktop theme.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if you are using a Matrox Impression Video display
	driver. This driver is incompatible with Windows 95.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:
	
	- Contact the manufacturer of the video card to inquire about obtaining an
	  updated driver.
	
	- Disable the desktop theme. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	  1. In Control Panel, double-click the Desktop Themes icon.
	
	  2. In the Theme box, click Windows Default, and then click OK.
