	- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, the file copy gauge shows that
	all the files have been copied, but you may experience one or more of the
	following problems:
	
	- Setup does not install the Dial-Up Networking Server component.
	
	- The Internet Setup Wizard does not work correctly.
	
	- You cannot preview desktop bitmaps in Desktop Themes.
	
	CAUSE
	=====

	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you can determine which Windows 95 component still needs to be installed, try
	to install it using the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. Otherwise,
	free additional space on the hard disk and then reinstall Microsoft Plus!.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	It may be necessary to remove Microsoft Plus! or the optional Windows 95
	component before you reinstall Microsoft Plus!.
