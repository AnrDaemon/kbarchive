	Media Vision's Premium 3D and Pro 3D sounds cards do not function
	correctly under Windows NT.
	
	The Premium 3D and Pro 3D sound cards are based on different chipsets than
	the Pro Audio Spectrum and Pro Audio Studio models. The audio portion of
	these adapters is based on Media Vision's Jazz chipset which does not work
	with the Media Vision audio drivers supplied with Windows NT. The SCSI
	portion of these adapters is based on the NCR 406A chipset which does not
	work with the Trantor Media Vision SCSI drivers supplied with Windows NT.
