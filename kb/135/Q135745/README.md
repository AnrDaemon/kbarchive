	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the black and white view to control how objects will be printed to
	a black and white printer, some objects are displayed and printed in grayscale.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In black and white view, some objects are printed in grayscale by default.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you want to print everything in either black or white, customize the black
	and white view. To print your presentation (or certain objects) without shades
	of gray, perform the following steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, click Black And White.
	
	2. If any objects appear in grayscale on your slide, select them.
	
	  TIP: You can select all objects on the slide by pressing CTRL+A, or you can
	  press SHIFT and click multiple objects to select them.
	
	3. Use the right mouse button to click any object, point to Black And White on
	  the menu that appears, and click Black With White Fill.
	
	4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all objects or slides.
