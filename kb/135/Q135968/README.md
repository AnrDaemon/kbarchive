	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, you see the following message
	early in the installation process:
	
	  You can choose not to install Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, or
	  change its destination folder later during Setup.
	
	This information is not correct. Although you can change the destination folder
	for certain components later in Setup, you cannot change the destination folder
	for Microsoft Plus! as a whole later in Setup.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To change the destination folder for Microsoft Plus! as a whole, change the
	destination folder the first time you are given the opportunity to do so.
