	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Under Windows NT 3.51, when a Canon BubbleJet driver is installed and shared as
	an Services for Macintosh (SFM) printer, the first incoming print job from a
	Macintosh client does not print and then the printer is no longer published on
	the AppleTalk network as a Macintosh printer.
	
	As a result, Canon BubbleJet printers cannot be used with Macintosh clients from
	Windows NT Server.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
