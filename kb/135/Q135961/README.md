	Article: Q135961
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Microsoft Plus! and select a desktop theme, system performance
	may appear to be slower. For example, Start menus may take longer to open,
	full-window dragging may produce ghost images, and screen updates may take
	longer. In addition, X-Windows-based programs may leave window trails.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Using a desktop theme places higher processing demands on the video adapter and
	system CPU.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To permanently resolve this problem, use a high-performance video adapter with a
	minimum of 2 MB of video ram, and upgrade to a higher-performance CPU to
	increase overall system performance.
	
	As a temporary workaround, follow these steps:
	
	1. Use the right mouse button to click an empty area of the desktop, and then
	  click Properties on the menu that appears.
	
	2. On the Plus! tab, click the Show Window Contents While Dragging check box to
	  clear it.
	
	3. Click the "Show icons in all possible colors" check box to clear it.
	
	4. Click the "Stretch desktop wallpaper to fit the screen" check box to clear
	  it.
	
	5. Click OK.
