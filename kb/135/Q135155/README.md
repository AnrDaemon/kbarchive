	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may be unable to see Multiple Document Interface (MDI) window frames while
	you are resizing child windows.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Normally, when you resize a child window, the new window size is indicated by a
	light gray outline.
	
	In True Color modes, the color used for the child window outline is
	indistinguishable from the default window background color.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To make MDI window frames visible while you are dragging the window, use one of
	the following methods:
	
	- Change the window background to a different color
	
	- Change the display to use fewer colors.
