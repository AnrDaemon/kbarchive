	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The bottom portion of CD Player may be off the screen or inaccessible.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if the font size for menu items is set to more than 16.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, reduce the font size for menu items, or increase the
	size of the menus. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. Use the right mouse button to click an empty area on the desktop, and then
	  click Properties on the menu that appears.
	
	2. Click the Appearance tab.
	
	3. In the Item box, click Menu.
	
	4. Change the font size to 16 or less, or increase the menu size.
	
	5. Click OK.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This problem is not limited to CD Player, and can occur with other display
	settings. Enlarging the menu font too much can cause popup menus to become
	unreadable. Note that the resolution setting you are using affects the upper
	limit on the size of the menu fonts you can use.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
