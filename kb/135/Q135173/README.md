	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may not be able to see the window frame of a Multiple Document Interface
	(MDI) window when you are dragging the window.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In True Color modes, the color used for the window frame is virtually
	indistinguishable from the default window background color.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To make MDI window frames visible while you are dragging windows, use either of
	the following methods:
	
	- Change the window background to a different color on the Appearance tab in
	  the Display tool in Control Panel.
	
	- Change the color palette to a High Color mode, or a lower mode, on the
	  Settings tab in the Display tool in Control Panel.
