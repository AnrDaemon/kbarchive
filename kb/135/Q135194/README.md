	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When Microsoft Cinemania for Windows, 1995 edition, is minimized, if you use the
	right mouse button to click Cinemania '95 on the taskbar, and then click About
	on the menu that appears, nothing happens, and you cannot maximize the program.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Cinemania 1995 positions its About dialog box relative to its window position.
	In Windows 95, when a window is minimized, it is actually off the screen.
	Therefore, the About dialog box is positioned off the screen.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Press ENTER to close the About dialog box that is positioned off the screen.
