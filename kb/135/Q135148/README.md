	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using Phone Dialer or the Microsoft Exchange Address Book's dialing
	feature, you may be prompted to pick up the handset before the dialing is
	finished. When you do so, the dialing is interrupted.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Some modems do not break the circuit between the phone handset and the phone
	line while dialing. On pulse-dial phone systems, this prevents the modem from
	being able to completely dial the phone number if the handset is taken off the
	hook before the dialing is finished.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Wait until the pulse dialing is finished before picking up the handset.
