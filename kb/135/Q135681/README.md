	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows NT 4.0 Printers Folder and Windows NT 3.51 Print Manager does not list
	Multi Purpose(MP) Tray as an available paper source for the HP 4 series
	printers. Windows NT 3.5 has this option.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The paper tray names were changed in Windows NT 3.51 to provide a consistent
	interface between Windows NT and Windows 95.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To print to the MP tray on an HP 4 printer, choose Upper Paper Tray as the
	source. The output will be correctly routed to the MP tray.
