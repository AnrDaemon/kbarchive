	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Automap Streets for Windows, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the Map View is Zoomed In to reveal individual street locations, Road Names
	cannot be viewed. This is because the text lettering is white and the background
	is white.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	On the Map tab, when you select Black as the Colored background, Road Names turn
	white. When you remove the Colored background, the white Road Names cannot be
	viewed because the background color is also white.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	On the Map tab, located on the Map Display Options menu, change the Colored
	background option from black to white.
	
	Road names now display in black on a white background.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Other colors affect the Road Name functionality. The loss of Road Names depend
	upon the color selected. If the Road Name disappears, use the resolution
	provided.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Automap Streets version 4.0 for
	Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
