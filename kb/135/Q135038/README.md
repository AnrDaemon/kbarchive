## Q135038: Cannot Scroll Through Printer List with Keyboard in Tools

{% raw %}

	Article: Q135038
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): 95
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): win95

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You are unable to use the keyboard to scroll through the list of installed
	printers in the Print dialog box in the tools included with Windows 95 (such as
	Paint).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known problem with 32-bit programs that use the Comdlg32.dll file.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can press ALT+DOWN ARROW to access the drop-down list box containing the
	list of installed printers. Once the list box is open, use the ARROW keys to
	scroll through the list. Note that if the mouse pointer is over one of the
	printers, the selection highlight will return to that printer. Move the mouse
	pointer out of the list box to correct this problem.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
