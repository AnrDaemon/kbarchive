	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the Windows 95 Backup tool, you cannot save the current file
	set until you select the files to back up and a destination for the backup
	files. After you click the Start Backup button and back up the files, you cannot
	save the file set.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Make sure to save the file set before you click the Start Backup button to begin
	backing up the files.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Save and Save As commands become available on the File menu after you select
	the files to back up and a destination for the backup files. You should save the
	file set before you begin backing up the files, because the list of files to
	back up and the destination are no longer selected after the backup is finished.
