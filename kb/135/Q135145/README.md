	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you select a group of files, use the right mouse button to click the selected
	group, and then click Quick View on the menu that appears, some of the files may
	not be displayed. Instead, you may receive an error message stating that a file
	is damaged or invalid, or the Quick View window may display a "Serious error"
	error message.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	View the files individually, rather than as a group of selected files.
