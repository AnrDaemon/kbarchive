	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Unlike Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Microsoft Exchange Windows clients do not
	allow you to directly import folders using the File Import command.
	
	In Microsoft Exchange, the File Import command imports Microsoft Mail .MMF files,
	as well as Microsoft Exchange personal address book (.PAB) files.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To import folders from a .PST file, you must first add the .PST file to your
	profile:
	
	1. In the Microsoft Exchange Windows client, choose Services on the Tools menu.
	
	2. Click Add.
	
	3. Select Personal Folders in the Available Information Services list box.
	
	  If you do not have Personal Folders as one of the available information
	  services, contact your Microsoft Exchange administrator. The appropriate
	  information service is not installed on your computer and you will need to
	  reinstall the Microsoft Exchange client.
	
	4. Click OK. A dialog box will appear, asking you for the name of the .PST file
	  you want to open. If this file does not exist, a new (empty) file will be
	  created. If this file does exist, select the .PST file from which you want to
	  import the folders.
	
	The folders from the new .PST file are listed along with your other folders. You
	can move or copy folders or messages between the new .PST and your other .PSTs
	or folders.
