	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you try to transfer a Fine Artist Pigture Show created on one computer to
	another computer, you receive the following error message:
	
	  Hey! Sorry, I can't find your file. You'll have to use a different one.
	  Choose another file.
	
	This error message occurs when Fine Artist can't find all the files on the second
	computer that you used when you created the Pigture Show.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Make sure you copy all the files (pictures) that you used to create the Pigture
	Show, along with the Pigture Show file itself, when you transfer it to another
	machine. Use the information below to determine which files you need to copy to
	the disk or second computer.
	
	Windows
	-------
	
	Copy the following files:
	
	- Pigture show file. For example: Filename.sld
	
	- Individual paintings referenced in Pigture show. For example: Filename.mag
	
	Make sure the files are in the current user's folder. For example:
	
	  C:\Mskids\Users\Chris
	
	Macintosh
	---------
	
	Copy the following files:
	
	- Pigture show file (Its icon has images of 35mm slides on it).

	  paintbrushes on them).
	
	Make sure the files are in the current user's folder. For example:

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Pigture Show file consists of slide captions, transition effects and
	transition sounds, as well as references (pointers) to documents created in Fine
	Artist.
	
	The files can be used with either the Windows or Macintosh version of Fine
	Artist, but some filenames may have to be changed. For additional information,

	store two pictures in the same picture show on different floppy disks if you
	only have one floppy disk drive).
