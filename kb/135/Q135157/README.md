	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The COM ports on a NEC Image P90 computer may not be accessible in Windows 95.
	
	Also, only one of the COM ports may be displayed in Device Manager, instead of
	the two or more installed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The method that the BIOS in these computers uses to report COM hardware does not
	work correctly with Windows 95.
	
	RESOLUTION

	Contact NEC to obtain a newer BIOS. Upgrade to a BIOS version dated later than
	7/1/95.
