	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, versions 2.0, 7.0 
	- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
	- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create disk images for a custom application using the Microsoft Office
	97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup Wizard or the Microsoft Access
	Developer's Toolkit (ADT) Setup Wizard, the file compression ratio is less than
	some third-party compression utility programs. For example, the ODE or ADT Setup
	Wizard may compress a database from 1.7 megabytes (MB) to 1.06MB. In comparison,
	a third party compression utility may compress the same 1.7 MB database to 420
	kylobytes (KB).
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	REFERENCES
	==========
	
	For more information about custom setup in the ODE, search the Microsoft Access
	97 Help Index for "Setup Wizard, distributing."
	
	For more information about custom setup in the ADT, search for "ADT," and then
	"Creating setup programs" using the Microsoft Access for Windows 95 Help Index.
