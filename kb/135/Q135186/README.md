	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Open dialog box in some programs does not work after you open a file with a
	long filename. VistaPro version 3.0 is one such program.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Open dialog box in these programs does not support long filenames and may be
	corrupted by the use of a long filename. If you open a file with a long
	filename, some of the filename characters may appear in the Open dialog box the
	next time you use it.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To make the Open dialog box work correctly again, quit and then restart the
	program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Windows 95 assumes that all 32-bit programs support long filenames. However,
	some programs may not handle long filenames correctly.
