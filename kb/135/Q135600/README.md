	Chapter 17, page 514, of the "Windows NT 3.51 System Guide" and the online
	help incorrectly state the following:
	
	  For the Security log, the administrator can also set auditing policies in
	  User Manager that cause the system to halt when the security log is full.
	
	This is a documentation error in Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51. To cause the
	system to halt when the security log is full you must manually configure
	the registry. The procedure for this is located on page 197 of the Windows
	NT Resource Kit Version 3.51 Update book.
