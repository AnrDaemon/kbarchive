	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you set up Windows 95 on a computer with a Reveal TV300 adapter installed,
	the screen turns red during the hardware detection portion of Setup. The
	detection process continues, but the screen remains red.

	detection of the video adapter.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:
	
	- Connect the monitor directly to the video adapter and then run Setup again.
	
	- Remove the TV300 adapter from the computer, run Setup again, and then
	  reinstall the TV300 adapter after Setup is finished.
	
	- Contact the manufacturer of the TV300 adapter for information about using
	  this product with Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Reveal TV300 adapter lets you view television programs on the computer
