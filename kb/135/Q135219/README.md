	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you set your mouse for left-handed operation, the left-handed operation
	settings are not used for MS-DOS-based programs running in full-screen mode.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Run the MS-DOS-based program in a window, rather than in full-screen mode, if
	possible. MS-DOS-based programs running in a window do use the left-handed mouse
	settings.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is a design limitation of Windows 95.
