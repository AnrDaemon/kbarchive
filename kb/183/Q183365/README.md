	SYMPTOMS
	========

	overlapping. When you edit the Microsoft Draw object by double-clicking it, the
	text appears fine.

	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resize an object proportionally, select one of the resize handles on the
	corner of the object and then drag to change the shape of the object.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
