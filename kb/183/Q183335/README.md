	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you dial from a TAPI-enabled program (such as Dial-Up Networking or
	HyperTerminal), neither the calling card number nor the long distance area code
	are dialed when you have both of the following options selected:
	
	- Dial Using Calling Card
	
	- Dial As A Long Distance Call
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by a bug in the TAPI code, which causes it to incorrectly
	form the phone number, leaving out the calling card.

	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
