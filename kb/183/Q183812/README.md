	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a client application connected to a remote host over an ISDN bridge closes
	the connection, one or more of the following may occur:
	
	- If keep-alives are enabled, the ISDN connection is not permitted to timeout.
	
	- NETSTAT shows CloseSocket() as established. You must restart the computer to
	  recover from this condition.
	
	- Without keep-alives, eventually all of the user ports become permanently
	  exhausted. This renders the computer inoperative on the network.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
