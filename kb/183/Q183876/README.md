## Q183876: Exchange Server 5.0 SP2 TechNet CD-ROM Labeled Incorrectly

	Article: Q183876

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft TechNet April 1998 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This problem does not exist in the May 1998 version of TechNet. The May 1998
	TechNet CD-ROM on which Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2 is included is
	labeled correctly.
	
	The Readme.txt file that is included with the service pack on the April 1998
	TechNet CD-ROM clearly states that it is Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2. You
	should always view the associated Readme.txt file or Release Notes before
	applying a new service pack or installing a new program.
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 U.S. Service Pack 2 is included with the
	April 1998 version of Microsoft TechNet. However, the CD-ROM on which the
	service pack is included indicates that it is Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack
	1, not Service Pack 2. In addition, when you apply the service pack, the
	installation program does not indicate which service pack you are installing. As
	a result, when you apply Service Pack 2 from the TechNet CD- ROM, you may think
	you are applying Service Pack 1 instead.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2 does not include an uninstall program that
	can be used to remove Service Pack 2 after you install it. If you mistakenly
	install Service Pack 2 and then decide that you want to remove it, you must
	restore from a backup.
