	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to use a Priest to heal an Assassin in the "Yamato Empire of
	the Rising Sun" campaign, the Priest may not recognize and heal the Assassin.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Priest may not recognize the Assassin because Yamato Priests are blind and
	lame. The Priests cannot see the Assassins, and they cannot move.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use either of the following methods to heal the Assassin:
	
	- Move the Assassin closer to the Priest until the Assassin is recognized. The
	  Priest and Assassin may almost have to touch. When the Priest recognizes the
	  Assassin, the Assassin is healed.
	
	- Move the Assassin to different sides of the Priest until the Assassin is
	  recognized. When the Priest recognizes the Assassin, the Assassin is healed.
