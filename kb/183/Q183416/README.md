	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, version Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print an envelope to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet, series 870 CSE or
	970 CXI, using Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR- 1), the
	first envelope printed is blank. Subsequent envelopes are printed as expected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	There is a problem with the Clockwise Rotation Printing option in Word.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To print the first envelope correctly, turn on Clockwise Rotation. To do this,
	follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Envelopes And Labels, and click the Envelopes tab.
	
	2. Click Options, and then click the Printing Options tab.
	
	3. Click to select the Clockwise Rotation check box.
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	5. When placing the envelope into the printer, turn the envelope so that the
	  flap is on the left side.
	
	6. Click Print.
	
	This procedure forces you to ignore the setting specified on the printer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word 97 for Windows, (SR-1).
