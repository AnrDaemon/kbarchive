	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Discussion Wizard for Microsoft FrontPage is a wizard
	that allows you to create a discussion Web site or add discussion to an existing
	Web site, without writing any Active Server Pages (ASP) or HTML script. This
	utility is included on the Exchange Server version 5.5 CD in the
	\server\support\collab\fpwiz subdirectory and can be installed by running the
	Discwiz.exe program. The utility is also available on the Web aat the following
	location:
	
	  http://technet.microsoft.com/download/exchange/default.htm
	
	Or it can be found by querying "discwiz.exe" from the Microsoft Web page:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/
	
	in the Microsoft web or
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Discussion Wizard differs from the basic discussion wizard
	included with Microsoft FrontPage in that it stores messages and documents on an
	Exchange Server computer. This provides benefits over a Web- only accessible
	discussion group.
	
	Because discussion data is stored in an Exchange information store, both Web
	users and Microsoft Outlook users can participate in the same discussion and
	share information.
	
	You can create views on Microsoft Exchange folders that are also available to
	both Microsoft Outlook and Web users.
