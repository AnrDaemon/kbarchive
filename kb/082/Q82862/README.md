	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Under Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the printing quality when using Taxview for
	Windows (retail and professional versions) is very poor if the files are printed
	at in high resolution.
	
	Changing the printer resolution to the lowest possible setting may correct this
	problem.

	For HP LaserJet printers, the lowest resolution is 75 dots-per-inch (dpi).
