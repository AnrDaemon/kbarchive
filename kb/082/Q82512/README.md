	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When using the ATI ULTRA display board with Crystal fonts in Microsoft Excel for
	Windows, some characters are misrepresented in the Excel formula bar. For
	example, if you enter the following:
	
	  =sum(1,2,sum(1,2,sum(1,2,3)))
	
	Each time a closing parenthesis is entered, the opening parenthesis is drawn
	slightly to the right of where it was in the formula bar.
	
	To correct the misrepresented characters in the formula bar, use the Microsoft
	Windows operating system version 3.1 8514 display driver.
	
	The ATI ULTRA display board and Crystal fonts are manufactured by vendors
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	these products' performance or reliability.
