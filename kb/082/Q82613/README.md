	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you are running Xerox Ventura Publisher version 3.0 while on a network with
	Windows version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 and a second
	workstation tries to start Ventura, then the following error message is
	displayed at the second workstation:
	
	  VPKbnetwork.DLL
	
	  Failure - too many users
	
	Ventura is installed on the local workstation hard drives. Choose the OK button
	and the following error message is displayed:
	
	  Error in attempting to load VP.SER Network Admin. File.
	
	Any action shuts down Ventura. If you do not start the network, then Ventura
	loads properly. This does not happen in Windows 3.0.
	
	There is no solution to this problem. Xerox is aware of the problem and may
	address it in the next release.
