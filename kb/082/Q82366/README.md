	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	With Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the Canon LBP III/4 printer drivers may not
	print all Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows patterns correctly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because PowerPoint is sending a pattern that the driver
	cannot recognize. To work around this problem, change the patterns used in the
	file or print to another printer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To see which PowerPoint patterns won't print correctly, choose Patterns from the
	Draw menu; the second, third, and fourth patterns in the first column will print
	completely black when the Canon LBP III/4 drivers are used.
