	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Pioneer Software's Q+E program, pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL in the middle of a long
	SQL query properly generates the CTRL+ALT+DEL message screen in Microsoft
	Windows operating system version 3.1. Pressing ENTER (selecting Close
	Application) brings up the CTRL+ALT+DEL "can't close application" message
	screen. Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL (to reboot the system) at this point, does not
	reboot the system.
