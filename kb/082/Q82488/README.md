	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Publisher, upside-down double-underlined text may be printed
	incorrectly under Microsoft Windows with the IBM Proprinter III.
	
	This behavior does not occur in Windows 3.0. The IBM Proprinter driver is the
	only mini driver causing this problem.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Try switching to another printer driver that is IBM Proprinter-compatible to see
	if it works correctly.
