## Q82315: Inconsistent Rotation Between Device and TrueType Fonts

	Article: Q82315

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using mapping modes other than MM_TEXT and text alignment other than the
	default (TOP-LEFT), device fonts may rotate in the opposite direction of
	TrueType fonts and exhibit other strange behavior.
	
	This may display on either the screen or printout when text is rotated. The text
	may rotate the wrong direction on the screen, or rotate a different direction on
	the printer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The incorrect rotation is due to the application's behavior, not to Windows
	3.1.
