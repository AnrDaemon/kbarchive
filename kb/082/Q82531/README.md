	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You cannot start WordPerfect Office with the File Run command in Microsoft
	Windows 3.1.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The name of the main WordPerfect Office file is SHELL.EXE. When you choose the
	File Run command, Windows version 3.1 sees that SHELL.DLL is loaded and fails to
	run WordPerfect Office.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, start WordPerfect Office from the MS-DOS Command
	Prompt.
