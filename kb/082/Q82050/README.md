## Q82050: PC Win: Wide Objects Cannot Be Entirely Viewed

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	When you insert a wide spreadsheet Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) object from
	Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for Windows into a version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for
	Windows Compose window, the object is not displayed entirely.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The OLE object is pasted correctly, but because the width of the object is
	larger than the Compose window, and because no horizontal scroll bars are
	available, you cannot see the right side of the object.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can view the OLE object in its entirety by launching the server application
	for the object. This is done by double-clicking the object or by selecting the
	OLE object and then choosing Object from the Edit menu.
	
	To determine whether or not the entire OLE object is being displayed, select the
	object. If all eight resize handles (little boxes) are visible, the whole object
	is visible.
