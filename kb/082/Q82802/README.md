	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When using Aldus PageMaker version 4.0 with Microsoft Windows operating system
	version 3.1 with many fonts installed (TrueType and/or others), the PageMaker
	font menu extends past the end of the screen. To access any of the installed
	fonts, choose Type, Type Specs, and search the Fonts box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Aldus PageMaker 4.0 and other Windows 3.0 applications put the available fonts
	in a menu for faster access. Under Windows 3.1, the number of available fonts is
	greatly increased and sometimes causes the menu to be too large for the screen.
	In Aldus PageMaker 4.0, you can access any of the installed fonts by choosing
	Type, Type Specs, and then searching in the "Fonts" box for the font desired.
	Most applications with fonts in a menu have similar workarounds.
