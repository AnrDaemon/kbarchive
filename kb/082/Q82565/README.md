	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When starting Quicken for Windows with Norton Desktop for Windows as the shell
	under the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, Quicken starts and
	then switches to the background if "Yes" is chosen for the message "Warning
	Quicken has not been tested under this version of Windows." If "No" is chosen so
	that the message is no longer displayed, Quicken starts correctly.
	
	This problem does not occur with Windows 3.0. It also does not occur if the
	message is turned off. This problem has been corrected in Quicken version 1.01.
