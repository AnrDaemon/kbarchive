	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When using Microsoft Windows TrueType fonts with applications that
	support Page View or other condensed views such as Fit to Page or Fit
	to Window, TrueType bold and bold italic fonts no longer appear bold.
	
	This problem is the result of applications reducing the line widths of
	fonts to one pixel on the display, and is done intentionally for
	readability. When displayed in actual size or printed, the text will
	appear as bold.
