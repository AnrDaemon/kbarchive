	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Excel may cause a General Protection (GP) Fault to occur when reading corrupted
	Excel spreadsheets in the Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1 and
	3.0. This problem may not occur with standard File Open operations. It is more
	likely that an automated file operation, such as "Update Unopened Documents,"
	will cause this error.
