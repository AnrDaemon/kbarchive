	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you install the MBI Legacy word processor version 1.1 from Windows File
	Manager by choosing Run from the File menu and then pressing the ENTER key or
	choosing the OK button, the following error messages appears:
	
	  Cannot Open Setup.inf
	
	  Cannot find section in the setup file
	
	If the error messages are ignored, then the installation hangs the computer. This
	behavior does NOT occur if you double-click the SETUP.EXE file or choose Run
	from Program Manager's File menu.
