	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Popup Window is a ROM-based utility on Toshiba laptops that includes several
	battery-saving functions. This utility does not work properly with Microsoft
	Windows version 3.0 running in 386 enhanced mode.
	
	To work around this problem, obtain the WINTOSH.ZIP shareware utility program
	from the Toshiba BBS. This utility is designed to replace Popup Window while
	running 386 enhanced mode Windows.
	
	This shareware utility program is also available on CompuServe under the name
	WINTSH.ZIP.
	
	NOTE: This shareware utility was NOT created by Toshiba and is updated by its
	author on an ongoing basis.

	the appropriate calls to the ROM BIOS while Windows is operating in 386 enhanced
	mode.

	standard modes of Windows.
