	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Central Point Software's PCTools CPLauncher 1.1 has an enhanced three-
	dimensional (3-D) Control or System menu. The Control menu is the menu that
	appears when ALT+SPACEBAR is pressed. When using ALT+TAB to switch between
	applications, the Control menu appears as the Windows standard control-menu box
	until it is activated by clicking on it, which turns it back to the CPLauncher
	3-D appearance.
	
	Within the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the 3-D box may appear
	for a brief instant and is then replaced by the Windows Control menu.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This problem occurs when the scheduler is overlaid upon the Program Manager. It
	will not occur if both the scheduler and the Program Manager windows are
	minimized and separated.
	
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PCTools CPLauncher version 1.1.
