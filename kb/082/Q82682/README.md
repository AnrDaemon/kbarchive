	The HDC Memory Viewer version 1.0 runs in Microsoft Windows operating
	system version 3.1; however, the way that Memory Viewer displays free
	memory may cause some confusion about this ability.
	
	The Memory Viewer replaces its icon title with the amount of free
	memory. If you press ALT+TAB to restore the Memory Viewer icon, the
	amount of free memory displays instead of the title HDC Memory Viewer.
	The Memory Viewer continues to work as usual. This problem does not
	occur if you do not minimize the Memory Viewer when switching
	applications.
