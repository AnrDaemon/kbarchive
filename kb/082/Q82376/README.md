	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Under Microsoft Windows, certain metafiles pasted into applications may print as
	black boxes when printed to a PostScript printer. This occurs with metafiles
	that issue XOR ROP commands to the PostScript driver. Metafiles without XOR ROP
	commands print correctly.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
