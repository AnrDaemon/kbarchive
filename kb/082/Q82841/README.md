	=======
	
	When the IBM PC3270 for Windows version 2.0 (2.01 with Corrective Service
	Diskette) is used with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the
	following problems occur:

	  shows how much of setup has been completed.
	
	- When attempting to configure or reconfigure the application, the File and
	  Directory boxes are not displayed correctly.
