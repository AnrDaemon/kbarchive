	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When Brief is run in a partial window, the focus will jump to the clock at the
	bottom. This makes it hard to work in a partial window. Run Brief in a full
	window or in full-screen mode.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Brief displays a clock in the lower-right corner of the display. It flashes the
	":" every second. It does this by moving the insertion point between your
	location and the clock. The window is tracked to the current cursor position so
	that you can see where you are typing. By moving the cursor, Brief tricks
	Windows into thinking the clock is the insertion point.
