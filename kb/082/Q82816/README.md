	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Applications designed to use OLE in the Microsoft Windows operating system
	version 3.1 may vary in user interface appearance.
	
	These variations mainly occur in applications that were developed before a
	complete user interface guide was available. Some applications do not support
	full OLE implementation (server, client, linking, and embedding); this also
	makes the OLE user interface differ in some cases.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some applications do not offer access to the commands on the Edit menu for the
	objects that support multiple-name commands (such as Sound Recorder). Some
	applications have the Insert Object command on the File menu instead of on the
	Edit menu.
