	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If Excel 3.0 spreadsheet gridlines are formatted for the color Cyan, the shading
	used on the spreadsheet will print out completely black, hiding the text or data
	typed into this shaded area. Several dot- matrix and laser printers demonstrate
	this problem. Color printers should be able to dither the shading correctly. The
	only workaround for non-color printers is to change the gridline's color back to
	black or another dark color.
	
	This information applies to the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.
