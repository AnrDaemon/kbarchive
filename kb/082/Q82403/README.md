## Q82403: Attachmate 3.21 Font Lists Multiple Times

	Article: Q82403
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When run under Windows, the Attachmate 3.21 Preferences and Fonts New Courier
	selection lists the font size "24" four times. It seems there are no different
	font sizes available.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is not a problem; the application is listing the name four times because of
	the four formats of the font: regular, bold, italic, and bold- italic.
	
	WordPerfect for Windows version 5.1 and Juggler also list multiple fonts of the
	same family.
