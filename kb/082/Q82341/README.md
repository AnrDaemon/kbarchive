	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print documents containing many TrueType fonts from Microsoft Windows
	3.1 to a Kyocera F-1010 laser printer, all or part of the text may be missing
	from later pages.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, follow these steps to print TrueType fonts as
	graphics:
	
	1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Printers icon.
	
	2. Choose the Setup button, then choose the Options button.
	
	3. Select the Print True Type As Graphics check box.
	
	The Kyocera F-1010 printer has partitioned printer memory. You can also work
	around this problem by configuring partitioned printer memory so that as much as
	possible is allocated for raster graphics.
