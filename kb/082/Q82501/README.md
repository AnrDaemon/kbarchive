	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Under the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, depending on the
	memory available, it is possible to drag and drop a file from File Manager into
	Write or Cardfile, resulting in a blank Packager object. This problem is most
	likely to occur under low memory situations when large files are being
	transferred. Closing down other applications and freeing up memory in general
	will solve this problem.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
