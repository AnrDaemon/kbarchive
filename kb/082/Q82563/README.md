	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 may hang if it is run with an
	older Logitech mouse driver (versions 5.0 and earlier). This problem will occur
	when you are task switching from an MS-DOS box back to Windows.
	
	The Logitech mouse driver that ships with Windows 3.1 should be used. You can
	install it by running Setup from Windows or from the MS-DOS prompt.
