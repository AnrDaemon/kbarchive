	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1, Lan Fax
	Redirector for Windows appends an extra extension to the filename if you retry
	to save a file to nonexistent path. For example, after trying to save FILE.TXT a
	few times, the filename is listed as FILE.TXTTXTTXT
	
	To correct this problem, double-check the filename before saving the file.
	
	This problem occurs in both Windows 3.0 and 3.1.
