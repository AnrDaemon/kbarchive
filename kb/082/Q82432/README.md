	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Using 8514 as the primary display, and a built-in VGA as the secondary display,
	you may get unreadable characters on the secondary VGA monitor (the secondary
	monitor appears to lose its synchronization signal) when switching from MS-DOS
	Prompt in full-screen mode back to Windows.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	When this problem occurs, Microsoft recommends that you try to switch back to
	the MS-DOS Prompt in full-screen mode, then back to Windows to try and change
	the state of the VGA monitor because this situation can stress the monitor.
