	copy if the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 is being installed
	for the first time on a computer with no previous installation of Windows
	present:

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	An easy workaround to this problem is to install the Hewlett-Packard (HP)
	LaserJet Series II first, which will copy the UNIDRV.HLP file. Then, install the
	desired printer driver.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
