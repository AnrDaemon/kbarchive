	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Pathworks network, using File Manager
	to search for a file on a network drive may or may not work correctly under
	Microsoft Windows. Some files may be skipped. In some cases, no files will be
	found even if there are some that meet the search criteria. Even doing a search
	on all files (*.*) may not result in any files found, or the message "No match
	found" may be generated.
	
	This problem only occurs when searching from the root directory with versions 4.0
	and 4.1 of DECnet.
