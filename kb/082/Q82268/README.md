	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows receives a Schedule+
	for Windows meeting request and the message is then moved to a shared folder,
	the subject line is changed to something similar to
	
	  >>>>!3/20/92 17:00-17...
	
	instead of the correct subject line as displayed in a private folder.
	
	The correct subject line appears when you read the message; only the summary in
	the shared folder displays the incorrect subject.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
