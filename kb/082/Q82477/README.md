	The TIGA display driver that shipped with Microsoft Windows 3.1 contains
	instructions specific to 80386 processors because the TIGA driver does not
	work on 80286-based machines.
	
	If the TIGA driver is installed on an 80286 system, application errors may
	result. If this occurs, Microsoft recommends that a compatible display
	driver be used. The VGA display driver that shipped with Windows works
	correctly on 80286 machines.
