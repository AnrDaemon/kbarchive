	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In the Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1, Fax Manager for
	Windows version 1.0 allows you to save files with embedded spaces included in
	the filename (for example, MYFILE.TXT can be saved as MY FILE.TXT).
	
	If you do a directory listing from the MS-DOS prompt, the filenames with embedded
	spaces become visible. If you attempt to display the file with the TYPE command,
	the following error message displays:
	
	  Filename Does Not Exist.
	
	Embedded spaces are not valid filenames with the MS-DOS and Windows operating
	systems. Microsoft recommends you do not save any files with embedded spaces.
	
	Fax Manager for Windows is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
