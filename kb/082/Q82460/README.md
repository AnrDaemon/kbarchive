	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Changing the window size of any application inside Microsoft Windows operating
	system version 3.1 with the Wilson Command Post Clock version 7.2 or earlier
	running at the same time hangs the system and requires a system reboot. Pressing
	CTRL+ALT+DEL is not sufficient.
	
	Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL, ENTER terminates the Command Post Clock, but when issued
	inside Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, it leaves Windows with no
	cursor.
	
	The Wilson Command Post Clock is manufactured by Wilson WindowWare, a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	this product's performance or reliability.
