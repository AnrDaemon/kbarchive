	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can import graphics from CorelDRAW! into Windows Paintbrush by converting
	them to a PCX file format from CorelDRAW!. The image's colors are not retained
	when converted to the PCX format. Colors are converted to black and white.
	However, you can do a screen dump in CorelDRAW, then paste the screen dump into
	Paintbrush. This keeps the colors intact.
