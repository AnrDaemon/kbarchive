	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	There are slight differences in font spacing and layout in documents
	created under Windows 3.0 and brought into Microsoft Windows operating
	system version 3.1. The average character widths of fonts are different in
	Windows 3.1. This difference is due to three significant changes made to
	Windows 3.1:
	
	- Windows 3.1 corrected incorrect font metrics.
	
	- There were DTP (DeskTop Publishing) characters added to the character sets in
	  Windows 3.1.
	
	- The average-width formula used to calculate spacing is now consistent
	  throughout Windows 3.1.
	
	The differences will appear on the screen and on printer output.
