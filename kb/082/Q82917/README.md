	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Changing the button face color in the Microsoft Windows Control Panel from the
	default gray to another color causes Microsoft Mail for Windows to display the
	status bar with what seems to be a hole on the right end.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The status bar colors are gleaned from the colors for a regular push button.
	However, the background of the bitmap icons for that location are light gray and
	cannot be changed.
