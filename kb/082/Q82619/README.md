	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When the application FAX.EXE (supplied with Intel's SatisFAXtion fax board) is
	displaying an incoming fax in an MS-DOS window, two sets of moving mouse cursors
	are displayed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Intel's SatisFAXtion fax board comes with a MS-DOS-based program called FAX.EXE.
	This program allow you to send files and documents as faxes, and to view
	incoming faxes on the screen. When a fax is viewed on the screen, the program
	switches into graphics mode (640 x 480 monochrome). A graphic mouse cursor
	appears along with Windows-like scroll bars.
	
	When a fax is displayed in a window, moving the mouse causes the Windows arrow
	cursor to move as well as FAX.EXE's mouse cursor. The two cursors move at
	different speeds; only the "native" mouse cursor is the one that works. The
	application's mouse cursor doesn't move across the whole window; only a few
	square inches of the upper-left corner.
