## Q82345: Visual Basic Does Not Show Icons when Making .EXE File

	Article: Q82345

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you make an .EXE file under Visual Basic, Visual Basic asks you for the
	filename and also lets you select which icon you want to use for this
	application. Under Microsoft Windowsversion 3.1, it never displays the icon in
	the Make EXE File dialog box. This makes it difficult to determine which icon to
	use when making an application.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is caused by a problem in Visual Basic.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use the icon viewer provided with Visual Basic
	called Icon Works. This application is a sample application that can be compiled
	and run independently of Visual Basic to examine icons and show what they will
	look like in the final program.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual Basic version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
