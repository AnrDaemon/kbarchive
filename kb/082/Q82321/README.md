	================
	
	
	Depending on the CD-ROM and device driver, you may get the following message:
	
	     MCI Error: Hardware error on media device.
	
	After receiving this error, you can advance the track scroll thumb to track 2 and
	start playing Multimedia Beethoven again.
	
	NOTE: Once playing has been successfully started on track 2 or a later track, it
	may be difficult to scroll the track position. This only happens if the above
