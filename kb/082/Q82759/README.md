	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	For best printing results, Microsoft recommends that you use the printer drivers
	provided with Microsoft Windows, rather than printer drivers from other sources.
	For example, Word for Windows version 2.0 provides its own HPPCL5A.DRV printer
	driver. Setting up Windows 3.1 over earlier versions of Windows leaves the
	earlier printer drivers in the system directory. If strange printing results
	occur, check to be sure the proper Windows printer driver is in use.
