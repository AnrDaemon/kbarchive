	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
	For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.
	
	Some customers have discovered undocumented options and commands in MS-DOS 5.0
	and later. These options may not continue to exist, nor are they part of the
	regular MS-DOS test suite.
	
	Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not assist customers with
	undocumented options, nor describe how they work. Microsoft recommends that
	customers not use these options and commands.
	
	When assisting you, PSS may request that you remove any undocumented options that
	may be related to (or causing) a problem.
