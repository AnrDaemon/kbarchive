	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you run Microsoft Windows in real (3.0 only), standard, or 386 enhanced
	mode with the US-International keyboard layout, the right ALT key functions
	differently or not at all.
	
	With the US-International keyboard layout, the right ALT key is remapped for
	international functionality. The left ALT key can (and should) be used for
	Windows commands.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To check the Windows keyboard layout, do the following:
	
	1. From the Main group, choose the Control Panel icon.
	
	2. Choose the International icon.
	
	The international settings are displayed. In the Keyboard Layout box, check for
	the US-International setting.
	
	Problems with the right ALT key in Windows and the US-International keyboard
	layout include:
	
	- Pressing ALT does not highlight the first menu on the menu bar.
	
	- Pressing ALT+SPACEBAR does not open the Control menu.
	
	- Press ALT+F4 does not bring up the Exit Windows dialog box.
	
	- Pressing ALT+ESC brings up the Task List instead of cycling through the open
	  application windows and icons.
	
	- Pressing ALT+ENTER (in 386 enhanced mode only) switches an MS-DOS application
	  between full screen and a window but does not switch the application from a
	  window to full screen. Also, after you press the right ALT key and then press
	  ENTER, the left ALT key and ENTER do not work.
	
	If the US-International keyboard layout is used, the left ALT key functions
	normally and can be used for Windows commands.
