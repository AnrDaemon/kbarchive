	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Okidata 9- and 24-pin printers provide an automatic Top Of Form adjustment.
	To make this adjustment, load in the tractor-feed paper so that the paper is
	just grabbing on a few of the pins. Then pull back the lever on the left towards
	the front of the printer; this process should automatically feed the paper to
	the correct position. Push the lever towards the back of the printer. The
	printer knows that the print head is about 7/8-inch down from the top of the
	page; however, Windows needs it right at the top.
