	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Windows 3.1 and 3.11 Control Panel only allows the installation of
	a maximum of 17 printer drivers. Windows 3.0 and 3.0a allows for a larger
	number.
	
	If you have installed more than 17 printer drivers in Windows 3.0 and 3.0a, and
	are updating Windows in the same subdirectory, Microsoft recommends that you
	reduce the number of printer drivers to less than 17.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This limitation was put into place because applications for Windows display
	printer lists in varying ways. Having too many printer drivers created
	formatting problems for these lists.
