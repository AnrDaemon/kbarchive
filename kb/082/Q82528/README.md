	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some printers will not receive the correct resolution when resetting in Excel
	version 4.0 running under the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.
	This problem is caused when Excel 4.0 is used with the Panasonic KX-P1124 (or
	other dot-matrix printers using the same resolution as the default printer).
	
	When Print Quality (from the Excel 4.0 File menu, choose Print) is changed to 360
	dpi to obtain 360 x 360 resolution, 360 x 180 dpi is the output. If the Print
	Quality setting is re-examined, the 360 x 180 resolution is displayed instead of
	the 360 x 360 selected earlier.
	
	The Control Panel must be used to change the resolution to obtain the correct
	printout and setting.
