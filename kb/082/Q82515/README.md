	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you run Harvard Graphics version 3.0 in standard mode, switching out of and
	back into it can result in small black holes that "tear" away from the screen
	when the mouse is moved. This is a minor cosmetic problem and can be corrected
	by refreshing the screen from within Harvard Graphics.
