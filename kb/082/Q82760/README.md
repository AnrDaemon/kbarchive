	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Upon initial installation, the printer settings for the Citizen 9- and 24-pin
	printers have the Color option selected. If the printer does not have Citizen's
	color hardware installed, printing charts or text with color results in dark
	output. There is no dithering as expected.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, open Control Panel, and select the Printers icon.
	Choose the Setup button, and clear the Color check box. This dithers the colors
	to produce the correct output.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Setting the Intensity Control to as light as possible in the Setup dialog box
	does not have the desired effect if the Color check box is still selected.
