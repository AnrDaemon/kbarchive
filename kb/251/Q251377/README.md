	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use the autopilot successfully when you fly an ILS approach, use the
	following methods in the order in which they are presented.
	
	Install the Flight Simulator 2000 Update
	----------------------------------------
	
	To implement instrument fixes that improve game performance, download and install
	the Flight Simulator 2000 update from the following Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/games/fs2000/downloads_fs2000update.asp
	
	Change the Autopilot Heading Hold to 285 Degrees
	------------------------------------------------
	
	Change the autopilot heading hold (HDG) from 295 degrees to 285 degrees. To do
	this, use one of the following methods.
	
	Use the Heading Bug Adjust Knob Button:
	
	To use the heading bug adjust knob button to change the autopilot heading hold
	from 295 degrees to 285 degrees:
	
	1. Start Flight Simulator 2000.
	
	2. On the Flights menu, click Select Flight.
	
	3. Under Available Flights, scroll down until you see Tutorial 15, Situation 2.
	
	4. Click Tutorial 15, Situation 2, and then click the green check mark to start
	  the tutorial flight.
	
	5. On the instrument panel, click the heading bug adjust knob button on the
	  heading indicator (a red triangle labeled HDG at the lower-right side of the
	  heading indicator) to set the heading to 285 degrees.
	
	  Click the right side of the heading bug adjust knob button to increase and the
	  left side to decrease the heading in degrees.
	
	6. On the autopilot which is located at the bottom of the radio stack, click the
	  APR button (the Approach Hold function).
	
	Use the Autopilot Dialog Box:
	
	To use the Autopilot dialog box to change the autopilot heading hold from 295
	degrees to 285 degrees:
	
	1. Start Flight Simulator 2000.
	
	2. On the Flights menu, click Select Flight.
	
	3. Under Available Flights, scroll down until you see Tutorial 15, Situation 2.
	
	4. Click Tutorial 15, Situation 2, and then click the green check mark to start
	  the tutorial flight.
	
	5. On the Aircraft menu, click Autopilot.
	
	6. Click to select the Autopilot Active check box.
	
	7. Click to select the "HDG - heading hold" check box, and then type "285"
	  (without the quotation marks) in the "HDG - heading hold" box.
	
	8. In the "Navigation mode" box, click "APR - Loc Glidescope Hold".
	
	  NOTE: You do not need to deactivate the "HDG - heading hold" and "ALT -
	  altitude hold" autopilot functions if they are selected when you select the
	  "APR - Loc Glidescope Hold" mode.
	
	  The "HDG - heading hold" and "ALT - altitude hold" autopilot functions are
	  automatically deactivated as the autopilot recognizes the glideslope and the
	  localizer.
	
	9. Click the green check mark to save your autopilot settings.
	
	Maintain an Airspeed of 90 Knots
	--------------------------------
	
	Maintain an airspeed of 90 knots during your approach.
	
	A descent into the denser air that is present at lower altitudes tends to
	increase engine power. Reduce engine power slightly to maintain an airspeed of
	90 knots as you make your descent.
	
	Change the Altimeter Setting to 29.92
	-------------------------------------
	
	If you land short of the runway, the altimeter setting may be set to 30.15 by
	default.
	
	To resolve this issue, download and install the Flight Simulator 2000 update
	mentioned under "Install the Flight Simulator 2000 Update" near the beginning of
	the "More Information" section of this article.
	
	To work around this issue, manually use the altimeter calibration knob (the black
	button at the lower-left side of the altimeter) to set the altimeter setting to
	29.92. Click the right side of the altimeter calibration knob to increase and
	the left side to decrease the altitude setting.
