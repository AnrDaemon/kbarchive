	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to use Microsoft Paint to open a graphic file other than a bitmap
	(.bmp) file, you may be unable to do so. However, you may be able to do so on a
	different computer in Paint.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue can occur because Paint only provides support for bitmap files.
	However, if you install a program that provides filters for other types of
	graphic files (such as .gif or .jpg files), Paint can then provide support for
	these file types.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue and use Paint for files other than bitmap files,
	install a program that provides the appropriate graphics filter. For example,
	Microsoft Word for Windows provides an assortment of filters you can install.
