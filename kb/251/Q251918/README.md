## Q251918: XCLN: Outlook 2000 Supports Multiple Folders as Destination

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook 97 
	- Microsoft Outlook 98 
	- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Outlook 97 and Microsoft Outlook 98, if you click Services on the
	Tools menu, and then click Addressing, the "Keep personal addresses in" list
	contains only one entry: the personal address book (PAB). In Microsoft Outlook
	2000, this list may contain the PAB and one or more contact folders.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Outlook you can store frequently used addresses in a PAB. You can also store
	contact information in the form of contact items in the Contacts folder. A
	contact form permits you to store more detailed information than a PAB entry can
	store. You can also create multiple contact folders and use them to store
	appropriate contact information. For example, you can create a contact folder
	called "Friends," and create contact items about close friends in that folder.
	
	After you create these secondary contact folders, you can make them available as
	an e-mail Address Book. To do this:
	
	1. Right-click the contact folder that you want to make available as an e-mail
	  Address Book.
	
	2. Click Properties.
	
	3. Click the Outlook Address Book tab.
	
	4. Click to select the "Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book" check box.
	
	In versions earlier than Outlook 2000, when you click Services on the Tools menu,
	and then click Addressing, the "Keep personal addresses in" list can contain
	only the PAB, even though you may have configured one or more contact folders to
	be available as e-mail Address Books.
	
	In Outlook 2000, however, all of the contact folders that you configure to be
	available as e-mail Address Books are listed in the "Keep personal addresses in"
	list. You can then decide which of these contact folders that you want to be the
	destination of any new addresses that you create.
	
	NOTE: This destination for new addresses applies only to new addresses that you
	create by clicking Address Book on the Tools menu, or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B.
	It does not apply to addresses that you add by right-clicking an address in a
	received e-mail message. If you right-click an e-mail address in an e-mail
	message and click "Add to Contacts", that e-mail address is always added to the
	default Contacts folder, regardless of the new addresses destination setting.
