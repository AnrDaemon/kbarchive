	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, you
	may experience the following symptoms:
	
	- When you press the PLUS SIGN (+) key on the number keypad, air traffic
	  control (ATC) chatter does not start scrolling across the screen.
	
	- When you press a key or a button to which you have assigned the "Send ATC
	  text message" command, ATC chatter does not start scrolling across the
	  screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the "Send ATC text message" command is not
	available in the programs listed at the beginning of this article, even though
	this command is still listed under the "Assignment list" in the Controls
	Assignments dialog box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION

	Microsoft Flight Simulator.
