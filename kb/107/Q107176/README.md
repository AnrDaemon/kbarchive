	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Statue of Liberty in Flight Simulator is a two-dimensional image that
	appears to be propped up with stick.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The image for the Statue of Liberty was taken directly from Flight Simulator
	version 4.0 in which the image also appeared two-dimensional. However, in
	version 5.0 a brown line that looks very much like a stick stretches from the
	base of the statue to the middle of the back. However, the New York scenery
	add-on corrects this problem, making the statue three dimensional.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator for MS-DOS,
	version 5.0.
