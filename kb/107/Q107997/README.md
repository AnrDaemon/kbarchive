	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows for Workgroups 3.11 PIF Editor allows you to choose Standard Mode from
	the Mode menu. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 does not support standard mode.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This command remains in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 even though all
	standard-mode settings are ignored when the PIF file is used. If you choose
	Standard Mode, the following message is displayed:
	
	  Windows is not running in standard mode. The PIF information you enter may
	  not be appropriate. Are you sure you want to switch to this mode?
	
	If you choose OK, PIF Editor changes to the PIF editing screen for standard mode.
