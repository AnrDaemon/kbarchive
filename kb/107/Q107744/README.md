	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You cannot access a CD-ROM in Windows NT that was created by Easy-CD Pro 95
	using Joliet format.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you write files with file names containing certain European characters,
	Easy-CD Pro 95 writes the file names and folder names in a nonstandard Joliet
	format that Windows NT cannot interpret.

	To resolve this problem, upgrade to Easy-CD Pro 95 version 2.11 or later. The
	upgrade can be downloaded from:
