	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The forward view from the cockpit may not maximize when the W key is pressed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The W key will normally maximize the active window, that is, view 1, view 2, or
	map view, in Flight Simulator 5.0. However, if Full Screen External View is
	selected under View Options under the Views menu, the forward view from the
	cockpit will not maximize.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator for MS-DOS,
	version 5.0.
