	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Learjet's thrust reversers cannot be activated using the joystick. However,
	the thrust reversers can be activated using the mouse if you first drag the
	throttle lever for one engine up (to increase the throttle) then back down (to
	decrease the throttle and engage the thrust reverser). If you do this with each
	lever independently, you will eventually engage the thrust reversers on both
	engines.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To activate the thrust reversers using the keyboard:
	
	- If your function keys are at the top of your keyboard, hold down the F2 key.
	
	  -or-
	
	- If your function keys are on the left, hold down the F8 key.
	
	The longer you hold down the key, the more reverse thrust you will have. On the
	Learjet instrument panel, the red portion below the idle throttle position,
	indicates the amount of reverse thrust.
