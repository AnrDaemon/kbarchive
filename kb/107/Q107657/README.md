	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you create a greeting card in Creative Writer and then try to start over with
	the "all gone" (explosion/bomb) tool, all the pages will disappear except for
	the first one. You won't be able to return to an "all pages" view even if you
	choose that view with the Page Viewer (magnifying glass) Tool. However, if you
	create something on the remaining page and print it, it will print as if it were
	the first page of a greeting card. In other words, it won't print on the full
	page of paper; it will print only on the lower right-hand quarter of the page.
	
	The "all gone" tool should either leave you with a four-page display, so that it
	is obvious that you are still in a card document, or it should return to a full
	page mode.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0,
	1.1, and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
