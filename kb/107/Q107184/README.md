	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	
	To use Flight Simulator 4.0 Aircraft & Scenery Designer files with Flight
	Simulator 5.0, proceed as follows.
	
	NOTE: The following assumes the Flight Simulator program is installed on your
	hard drive on drive C and that the directory is FLTSIM5.
	
	1. Copy the Flight Simulator 4.0 database (the file named F1 in the FS4
	  directory) and the desired scenery files (with the extension .SC1) to the
	  Flight Simulator 5.0 scenery directory (C:\FLTSIM5\SCENERY by default).
	
	2. Run Flight Simulator and click Scenery Library from the Scenery menu. The F1
	  database is displayed in the Choose A Scenery Area list as Old FS4 World
	  Scenery.
	
	3. Click Old FS4 World Scenery, then click Select SC1 File to display the list
	  of ASD scenery files. Select the one you desire.
	
	4. If you want Flight Simulator to load the appropriate scenery files
	  automatically based on the aircraft position, then from the Selection option,
	  click Automatic By A&SD Scenery Bounds.
