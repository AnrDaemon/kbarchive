	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you maximize a table in Encarta, you may find that the text in the table
	suddenly looks garbled or is partially cut off. In some cases, the text may be
	illegible. This problem can occur if you are using an ATI Mach 32 video card and
	driver.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Encarta version 1994.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, use a video driver other than the ATI Mach 32 video
	driver. The problem only occurs with this driver.
