## Q107725: Writer: Can't Preview 16-Bit Sounds

	Article: Q107725

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Creative Writer and Fine Artist can't preview 16-bit sounds. If you try to
	preview a 16-bit sound you want to import, you won't hear anything. However, if
	you import the sound and put it in a document, you can play it successfully.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer and Fine Artist,
	versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. In the Studio, put a sticker on your page.
	
	2. Select the Sound Picker tool (the red-bulbed horn)
	
	3. Click on Ratdog (the orange dog with black spots).
	
	4. In the Portfolio Contents list, click on the words "Outside of Imaginopolis."
	  Ratdog searches your hard drive for sound files.
	
	5. From the list of files, select a 16-bit sound.
	
	The sound does not play when you click on the file name. Normally, the sound
	should play when you click on it.
	
	If you choose Go and import the sound into your document, you can play it
	successfully.
