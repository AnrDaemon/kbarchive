	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the Windows client
	will rebuild a corrupted folder without displaying any type of status message.
	This may cause you to assume the client is hung when it is actually performing a
	rebuild operation.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Allow the Windows client sufficient time to rebuild corrupted folders when you
	start the client software.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
