	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1993 edition 
	- Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you play a narrated animation in Bookshelf 1993, you may find that the
	Microsoft Windows Sound System volume control panel pops up and minimizes, but
	the sound does not play. If you restore the volume control panel, the sound
	plays correctly. If you try to adjust the volume, however, the animation will
	stop.
	
	This occurs if you have set the Microsoft Windows Sound System volume control to
	"show when sound is played" and "always on top."
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, turn off either the "show when sound is played" or
	"always on top" options in the Microsoft Windows Sound System volume control
	panel.
