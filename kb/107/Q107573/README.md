	========
	
	When you are using File Manager in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, directories that
	are on Novell NetWare servers may look as if they are being shared even though
	they are not. This problem occurs only if the machine is using the NetWare VLM
	DOS Requester and the corresponding NETWARE.DRV file from Novell.
