	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Select SC1 File button in the Scenery, Scenery Library menu will not be
	visible if the system is not configured to use at least 80K of expanded memory.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Expanded memory is required to take advantage of most scenery options in Flight
	Simulator 5.0 and to import files from Aircraft and Scenery Designer (Flight
	Simulator 4.0) for use with Flight Simulator version 5.0. The memory must be
	configured for at least 80K of expanded memory (EMS) or some options may not be
	available.
	
	For more information about how to configure the RAM memory as expanded memory,
	consult the inside back cover of the Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook
	or your MS-DOS or Windows manual.
