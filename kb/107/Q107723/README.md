	  or open a document.

	  character, just to the right of the "A").
	
	3. Ratdog appears, just to the right of the rolls of stickers. Click Ratdog.

	  searches your entire hard drive for graphics files in the supported formats.
	
	5. From the list filenames, select your graphic. A preview image appears.

	The graphic appears on your page.
	
	Graphics you copy from Creative Writer and Fine Artist are in PICT format on the
	Macintosh and .BMP format in Windows.
	
	Creative Writer documents are saved in a proprietary format, called RIFF
	(resource interchange file format). These files can be transferred between the
	Macintosh and Windows versions of Creative Writer without any translation. You
	cannot save graphics out from Creative Writer in any other format. However, you
	can save text from Creative Writer in the .TXT (text only) format, and open the
	text file in other applications.
	
	
	You can save pictures from Fine Artist for Windows in a .BMP format, and in a
	PICT format on the Macintosh. You can then open it in other applications that
	read graphics files.
