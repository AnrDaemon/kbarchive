	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Text you have formatted to be light blue, light gray, or medium gray may not
	print on the following:
	
	- Epson LQ 2550 printer
	
	- KX-P2130-2135 printer with the Universal printer driver version 3.1.4 and
	  Panasonic printer driver version 1.5
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0, 1.1
	and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The text does not print because the printer thinks that text formatted for these
	colors in Creative Writer is actually formatted as white.
