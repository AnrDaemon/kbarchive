	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Compiling with insufficient disk may generate the following error message:
	
	  
	
	  fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
	               (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 602)
	  Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual
	  Workbench Help menu, or open the Technical Support help file for
	  more information.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Lack of available disk space for the generation of various intermediate,
	listing, and object files by the compiler causes the above error.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Check for the available disk space when starting the compilation process; it
	should be large enough for all the intermediate, listing, and object files to be
	generated by the compiler.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
	beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.0.
