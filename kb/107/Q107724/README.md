	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you quit, then restart Creative Writer after you receive a message telling
	you that you have insufficient disk space, you may receive the following error
	message:
	
	  System Error #15 at 003CCA68 'CODE 0001 040C' + 00A0
	
	Your computer may stop responding (hangs), and you need to restart.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To eliminate this problem, restart your Macintosh and then remove excess files
	to floppy disk and/or delete them from your hard drive. When you have freed up
	some disk space, you should be able to run Creative Writer successfully.
	
	For more information about how to accomplish this task on your Macintosh, see
	your Macintosh printed documentation or online help.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0,
	1.1 and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	If you don't have enough disk space, you cannot save documents or perform many
	operations in Creative Writer.
	
	The message indicating that you are out of disk space also includes instructions
	to free up space and restart your Macintosh. If you follow these instructions,
	the System Error does not occur.
