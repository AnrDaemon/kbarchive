	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Mail and are prompted for the
	password, an option called "Remember Password" is available. This option caches
	your password so that the password dialog box no longer appears when you start
	Mail. However, if the Password box is blank and you select Remember Password,
	the password is not cached and you are prompted for the password each time you
	start Mail.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Workgroups Mail cannot cache a blank password.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	There is currently no resolution other than not using a blank password. If you
	choose a valid password, it is cached and you don't have to log on each time you
	start Mail.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
	version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	as it becomes available.
