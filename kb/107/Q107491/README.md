	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Encarta includes a button you can use to quickly access a word processor (so
	that you can take notes or copy articles). Encarta allows you to specify which
	of the word processing applications installed on your system you want to access
	when you choose that button.
	
	You cannot specify either WordPerfect or AmiPro as the default word processing
	application to use with Encarta.
	
	If you specify WordPerfect as your default word processing application and try to
	launch it from Encarta, the following message appears:
	
	  Word Processor could not be launched. Please select "Options" in the menu to
	  select a valid program.
	
	If you continue to click the Word Processor button, the following message
	appears:
	
	  Error\n\n The application could not be executed.
	
	If you specify AmiPro as your default word processing application and try to
	launch it from Encarta, the following message appears:
	
	  Encarta is unable to start your word processor correctly. Please see section
	  6 (Word Processors) of the Encarta README File for more information and
	  trouble shooting tips.
	
	There is no way to work around this problem.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Encarta, 1993 and 1994 editions.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
