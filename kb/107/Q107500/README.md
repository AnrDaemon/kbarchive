## Q107500: BUG: Invalid A2006 Error Generated by MASM 6.x

	Article: Q107500
	Product(s): Microsoft Macro Assembler
	Version(s): 6.0,6.0a,6.0b,6.1,6.11,6.1a
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 06-MAY-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1, 6.1a, 6.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to assemble the sample code below, the Microsoft Macro
	Assembler (MASM) fails and reports the following error for the two lines with
	"mov" instructions:
	
	  error A2006: undefined symbol
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around the problem, do one of the following,
	
	- Simplify the expression. If you uncomment the lines in the sample code, and
	  delete the original instructions, the code will assemble without errors.
	
	-or-  - Assemble with the /Zm option (or run MASM.EXE instead of ML.EXE).
	
	-or-
	
	- Use the OPTION OLDSTRUCTS directive to have the assembler treat structure
	  members the same as in MASM 5.1.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0x, 6.1, 6.1a,
	and 6.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	Sample Code
	-----------
	
	  ; Assemble options needed: none
	
	          .MODEL  small
	
	  STEST   STRUCT
	    f1    BYTE    ?
	    f2    BYTE    ?
	  STEST   ENDS
	
	          .CODE
	          mov     al, SIZEOF STEST.f1 + SIZEOF STEST.f2
	          mov     al, LENGTHOF STEST.f1 + LENGTHOF STEST.f2
	  ;
	  ; Uncomment the lines below and delete the two lines above to avoid
	  ; the A2006 error
	  ;
	  ;       temp = SIZEOF STEST.f1
	  ;       mov    al, temp + SIZEOF STEST.f2
	  ;       temp = LENGTHOF STEST.f1
	  ;       mov    al, temp + LENGTHOF STEST.f2
	
	          END
