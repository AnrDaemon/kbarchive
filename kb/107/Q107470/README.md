	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Setup program for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 uses the
	WFWShell statement in the [Boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to store
	the contents of your current Shell line.
	
	After Setup is complete, the WFWShell line is used to reestablish the Shell
	setting. Microsoft Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.1 used OldShell
	for this same purpose.
