	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you choose the Speller but it does not spell check your document or catch
	misspelled words, your dictionary file may have been damaged or deleted.
	
	Creative Writer won't let you know if your thesaurus or dictionary files get
	damaged or are deleted. If the dictionary is missing and you choose to spell
	check your document, Spike appears with the message "I finished checking your
	spelling," even though the Speller has not checked the document or corrected any
	spelling.
	
	If the dictionary or thesaurus files are missing, Creative Writer should generate
	an error message letting you know that you need to reinstall them.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If the Speller does not seem to be spell checking your document and does not
	catch misspelled words, check the words - are they capitalized? Creative
	Writer's spell checker does not check capitalized words, because it assumes they
	are proper nouns, such as names.
	
	If you verify that the words are not capitalized, and are not being checked, exit
	from Creative Writer and reinstall it. This should restore your dictionary and
	thesaurus files.
