	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following error message may occur even if you enter Com Frequencies within
	that range:
	
	  Com Frequencies are from 118.0000 to 135.975 in 0.025 increments.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If any frequency equal to or greater than 135.0 is entered in COM 1 Frequency in
	the Communication Radio under NAV/COM, the error message will be displayed. For
	example, the ATIS Frequency for Chicago O'Hare International Airport is
	135.4000. If this frequency is entered, the above error message will occur.
	
	To enter the frequencies for Chicago O'Hare directly from the main view without
	using the NAV/COM menu, press the C key on the keyboard to select the integral
	frequency or press CC for the decimal. Change the frequency with the PLUS (+)
	and MINUS (-) keys. Also, the mouse can be used by clicking to the left or right
	of the number. See page 128 of the Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook
	for version 5.0.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator for MS-DOS,
	version 5.0.
