	Many original equipment manufacturer (OEM) modem vendors sell modems
	that are licensed from other vendors. For example, some Gateway
	internal modems are actually U.S. Robotics Sportster modems.
	
	If you plan to use an unsupported modem with Windows for Workgroups
	Remote Access, you should contact your OEM and determine the true modem
	brand and model. Then, choose the actual modem type when you install
	Remote Access.
