	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Ju 87 Stuka aircraft is classified as a fighter in Combat Flight Simulator
	missions, even though it is actually a dive-bomber, because the flight model of
	the Ju 87 Stuka more closely resembles that of a fighter than that of a bomber.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Combat Flight Simulator, a computer-piloted Ju 87 Stuka aircraft selects a
	ground target, dives on the target, and bombs it. After the Ju 87 Stuka has
	destroyed the first target, it selects a new target.
	
	A Ju 87 Stuka drops one bomb per pass, and then uses guns to continue attacking
	ground targets. After a Stuka destroys all available ground targets, it engages
	any available air targets.
	
	The Ju 87 Stuka can also take evasive action when it is under fire.
