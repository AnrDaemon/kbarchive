	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you paste text formatted in Microsoft Windows Write into Microsoft Windows
	Paintbrush, you lose your special formats (underlining, italics, and
	superscripts).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Paintbrush cannot accept Write-formatted text characters from the Clipboard
	without stripping the formatting. Text pasted from Write into Paintbrush is
	converted automatically into the current Paintbrush text-format settings, as
	specified in the Font and Style menus.
	
	Many of the Write text-format selections can be duplicated in the Paintbrush
	environment. Other formats, such as superscript and subscript, are not available
	in Paintbrush.
