	With the release of Version 6.00 of the mouse, we decided to separate
	the programming aspects of the mouse and place them in the "Microsoft
	Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide." The guide contains the menu
	installer MENU.COM and the menu compiler MAKEMENU.EXE. If you have the
	software prior to Version 6.00, you will find MENU.COM and
	MAKEMENU.EXE on your system diskette.
