	in a proportional font. The print preview appears correctly, but when the
	message is printed, it is still in a proportional font. For example, if you set
	the font of a plain text message to Courier New and then print the message, the
	message is printed with Arial font.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Print the message from an Outlook 2000 client.
	
	STATUS
	======
