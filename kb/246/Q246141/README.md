	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, graphic elements in the scenery
	may intermittently flash or blink.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:
	
	- An S3 Trio3D/2X video adapter is installed in your computer.
	
	- Hardware acceleration is enabled in Flight Simulator 2000.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, disable hardware acceleration in Flight Simulator 2000.
	To do this:
	
	1. Start Flight Simulator 2000.
	
	2. On the Options menu, point to Settings, and then click Display.
	
	3. Click to clear the "Enable hardware acceleration" check box, and then click
	  OK.
	
	NOTE: If you experience very slow performance in the game after you disable
	hardware acceleration, repeat step two, click to select the "Low resolution
	mode" check box, and then click OK.
