	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the various ways of installing Visual SourceSafe 6.0. You
	may notice some differences if you are familiar with the setup processes
	involved with earlier versions of SourceSafe.
	
	You can receive Visual SourceSafe 6.0 from four different packages:
	
	1. A component of the Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise Edition.
	
	2. A component of the Visual C++ 6.0 Enterprise Edition.
	
	3. A component of the Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise Edition.
	
	4. An individual-boxed product.
	
	The setup procedures for the Enterprise Edition products and the individual boxed
	product are different, and although they all accomplish the same end result (the
	installation of Visual SourceSafe onto your computer), each installation
	procedure is different.

	Although the look of the Enterprise Edition setup procedures and the
	individual-boxed version setup procedures are very different, they all install
	the same components. It makes no difference which product you purchase; Visual
	Studio version 6.0 Enterprise, Visual C++ 6.0 Enterprise, Visual Basic 6.0
	Enterprise, or SourceSafe in its own box. The same product and the same
	components are installed on your computer.
