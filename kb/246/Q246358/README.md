	=======
	
	This article describes system administration with Interix.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Administration of a Microsoft Windows NT-based computer is performed mostly
	within the Win32 environment. The Win32 environment provides graphic user
	interface (GUI) tools for system administration. However, some tools are
	available for system administration tasks in the Interix environment. For
	example, you can handle the routine task of adding and deleting users with
	scripts instead of using GUI tools. The traditional tasks of system
	administration include the following:
	
	- File and folder permissions (traverse checking)
	
	- Logging on as another user
	
	- Adding and removing users
	
	- Performing backups
	
	- Running periodic processes
	
	- Starting and monitoring daemons
	
	Because Interix can run both Win32 and Interix programs, you can use a mix of
	tools to accomplish your administrative tasks.
