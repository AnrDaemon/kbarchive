	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you connect to the Internet through a cable modem on a computer running both
	Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 and Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0, you may
	experience interruptions in your service shortly after connecting. You are able
	to identify remote sites by IP (Internet Protocol) address (PING), but not by
	host name. The DNS (Domain Name Server) has been configured properly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur if the signal strength on your cable modem is too low.
	The signal's strength may be diminished if the length of the cable from your
	cable modem to your cable company's connection point exceeds the recommended
	length for the cable transmitting the signal.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, contact your cable company and request to have signal
	repeaters added to the line to amplify the signal.
