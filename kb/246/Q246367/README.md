	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Interix does not provide encryption technology because current law in the United
	States prohibits the delivery of encryption technology outside of the United
	States, or to foreign nationals residing within the United States. The crypt
	command is included in this prohibition.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Various source code CD-ROM distributions of systems such as Linux and FreeBSD
	include the crypt command. With Interix and the Interix SDK, you can recompile
	the c type source from such a CD-ROM for Interix.
