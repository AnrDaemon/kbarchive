	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Multiple (usually four) CD-ROM drive icons may appear in Windows Explorer and My
	Computer, even though you have only one CD-ROM drive. All four icons show the
	same information. For example, if you change the CD-ROM, all four icons reflect
	the change.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur with CR-series Panasonic CD-ROM drives (for example, the
	CR-562) and can occur when the CD-ROM drive is connected to an IDE or SCSI
	interface card.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Panasonic is aware of this problem and is currently working on updated drivers.
	Please contact Panasonic for additional information.
