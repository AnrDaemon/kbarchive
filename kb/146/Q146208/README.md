	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select Help while creating a new FAX recipient using the Microsoft
	Exchange client for Windows NT or the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95,
	you will receive the following error message:
	
	  The topic does not exist. Contact your application vendor for an updated Help
	  file. [129]
	
	  OK
	
	When you select Help while creating a new FAX recipient using the Microsoft
	Exchange client for Windows 3.x, you will receive the following error message
	twice:
	
	  Help topic does not exist.
	
	  OK
	
	A Fax help screen will appear in the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x
	but the information in the help file does not match the actual fax template. The
	fax template fields are:
	
	  Display Name
	  Location
	  Company
	  Fax Number
	
	and the help file in the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x displays the
	following:
	
	  Display Name
	  Fax Address
	  TO/CC/BCC
	  << Previous
	  >> Next
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
