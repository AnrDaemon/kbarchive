## Q146259: XADM: Field Help Dialog Doesn't List Fields Alphabetically

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Field Help... dialog box in Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer
	(EFD) does not list the fields that have been added to the canvas in
	alphabetical order. Instead, the fields are listed in the order in which they
	were added to the canvas. This behavior is not as expected and may make it
	difficult to find the desired field in the list.
	
	The field on the canvas that has the focus when the Field Help... dialog is
	triggered is the default field that shows up in the Field listbox.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Field Help... dialog is accessed by double-clicking on one of the objects
	that has been added to the canvas and then clicking on the Field Help... button.
	This feature is used only at design time and will not affect the end users of
	the forms.
	
	This issue should not drastically affect the designer of the form unless he has
	added many objects to the canvas. In this case, it may be most efficient to
	double-click on each object separately and go into that object's Field Help, by
	default, and add the help information.
