	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After your form has been compiled, you will find Microsoft Visual Basic files in
	the <FORMPROJ>.VB subdirectory. You can modify your form by using
	Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 to open the .VBP file, and making your
	modifications.
	
	Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0 adds extra functionality by allowing the use
	of Microsoft Visual Basic control types that are not offered by the Forms
	Designer. For example, you can access external databases that can include
	Microsoft Access databases (.MDB), Microsoft Open Data Base Connectivity (ODBC)
	based databases, or installable ISAM databases.
