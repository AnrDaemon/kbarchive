	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you insert an object into a new composed message, the scrollbar is not
	updated. The scrollbar thumb is at the top of the message instead of at the
	bottom, which makes for difficult reading.
	
	
	STATUS

	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
	Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95 clients. We are researching this problem and
