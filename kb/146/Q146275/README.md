	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you receive a Private (read-only) mail message with attachments, you can
	view and modify the attachments; however, you can not save the changes to the
	original message.
	
	When you close the Private message, and you made changes to the attachment, you
	will get the following message:
	
	If you make modifications to attachments in a read-only message until he closes
	the note and gets the message:
	
	  This message has been modified but this message is read-only.
	  Do you want to discard changes?
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you wish to save the attachment, you must save it under a different name.
