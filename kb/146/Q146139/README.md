	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you reply to a non-Microsoft Exchange Internet recipient, the original text
	will not be indented when the Internet recipient receives the reply.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The indenting of the original text is a Microsoft Exchange client function and
	is not understood by non-Microsoft Exchange clients.
	
	There is, however, a blank line between the original text and the reply text in
	order to delineate messages.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
	Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
