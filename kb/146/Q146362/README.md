	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A Microsoft Schedule+ owner has defined a delegate who is in a different time
	zone than the owner. When the delegate opens the owner[ASCII 146]s schedule, the
	schedule will appear in the time zone of the delegate. When the delegate creates
	an appointment and invites users who are in different time zones, the meeting
	request will appear in the time zone of the owner.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The meeting wizard will use the time zone of the individual creating the meeting
	request. In the event that users are spread across time zones, the meeting
	wizard will use the organizer[ASCII 146]s time zone and when the user accepts
	(books) the meeting, it will be reflected in their time zone.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 7.0 of Microsoft
	Schedule+. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
