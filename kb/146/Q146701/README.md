	Article: Q146701

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click Find on the Tools menu, and you select to view items by From and
	Size, the results will show the wrong number found.
	
	NOTE: All the messages will be found; however, the number of messages in the
	status bar will be reported as number of categories instead of messages.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Because the category rows will be included, the above behavior only happens when
	you have selected Group-by-View.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
	Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95 clients. We are researching this problem and
	will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
