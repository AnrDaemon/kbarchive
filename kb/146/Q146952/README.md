## Q146952: XCLN: Message Renamed to Subject Text After Embedding It

	Article: Q146952
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you embed a saved message into a new message, the title of the embedded
	message may change to the subject text, if the saved message was renamed outside
	of the Microsoft Exchange client.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Exchange assigns the subject text as the file name when a message is
	saved outside of Microsoft Exchange client. When a saved message is renamed, the
	new file name is not stored as the subject text. Therefore, if this message is
	embedded into another Microsoft Exchange message, the title of the message
	reverts back to the original subject text.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
	Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
