## Q146101: XCLN: Dirty Open Freedoc Does Not Give Cancel Option

	Article: Q146101
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 4.0 5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you click Word Close while editing a freedoc (a document that resides in one
	of Exchange's folders, but is not attached to a message), you either receive the
	option to save changes to the original document, or cancel and lose all changes.
	If you want to save the changes to a new document name (thus preserving the
	original document), you are unable to do so. There is no option to cancel the
	Word Close command.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This is by design, because OLE does not support this action.
