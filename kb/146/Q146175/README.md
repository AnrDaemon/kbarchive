	========
	
	When you run the Seven Habits wizard in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0a, it
	states that there are six steps in the organizing process but only the first
	three steps are available as radio buttons in the wizard.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Step 4 is listed towards the end of the Step 3 wizard. The other 2 steps are not
	in the available in the wizard because they are achieved not through the wizard
	but through self action.

	Step 1: Connect to Mission
	Step 2: Review Roles
	Step 3: Identify Goals
	Step 4: Organize Weekly
	Step 5: Exercise Integrity
