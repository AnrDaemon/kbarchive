## Q146693: XCLN: Importing 3.x Folders Textizes Meeting Requests

	Article: Q146693
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0; Win95:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 18-DEC-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you import an MMF that was exported from MSMail 3.x and contains Microsoft
	Schedule+ meeting requests, the meeting requests do not appear as a form like
	they did in MSMail 3.x. When the Schedule+ appointments are imported, they
	become textized and no longer are displayed as a form. The meeting request shows
	up in the Microsoft Exchange client with the From, Sent, To, and Subject lines
	along with any text that was in the meeting request.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This only happens during the import of an MSMail MMF file. If the MMF file is
	migrated to a PST file, the meeting requests are transferred correctly. During
	the process of importing the MMF file, the Schedule+ meeting request message
	type is set to IPM.Note so that when you view the meeting request in the
	Microsoft Exchange client, it appears as a plain text message.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
	Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
