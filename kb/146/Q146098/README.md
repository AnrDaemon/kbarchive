	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you insert a ClipArt Gallery object into a message and convert it into an
	icon, the object seems to disappear from the message. When you look more
	closely, you can see a small handled object in the message roughly in the place
	of the clipart object. However, this object cannot be selected.
	
	If you send the message, the recipient looks at the message and will find a gap
	in the previous location of the clipart object roughly the size of the icon. On
	the received message, the blank object can be selected. If double-clicked,
	ClipArt Gallery is launched and the original object is highligted.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Clipart Gallery. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
