## Q146039: Second Time Zone May Display Incorrectly

	Article: Q146039

	Version(s): WINDOWS:7.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you view two time zones in Schedule+, the secondary time zone displays its
	time incorrectly. This will occur if the secondary time zone is not set to
	adjust for Daylight Savings Time and the primary time zone is set to adjust for
	Daylight Savings Time.
	
	The time for the secondary time zone will be displayed one hour ahead of what it
	should when you view a multiple-day view during the days in that view after
	Daylight Savings Time is in effect. Once beyond the days in that view, the time
	displays correctly.
	
	This same problem occurs when time changes back to standard time. The time will
	display one hour behind what it should be when looking at a multiple- day view,
	and will display correctly when you get past the last day in that view.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 7.0 of Microsoft
	Schedule+. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
