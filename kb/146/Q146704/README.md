	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Fields may disappear when they are pasted on a Tab field in the Microsoft
	Exchange Forms Designer.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the selected field is not a container, the pasted control is placed onto the
	canvas. This occurs when pasting the following fields: Entry, Listbox, Checkbox,
	and Labels. The pasted fields are behind the Tab Field; to view them move the
	Tab Field.
	
	This is by design.
