	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) is set to FLUSH Mode, files in the
	IMCDATA\OUT directory remain. The IMC does not allow any messages to be sent or
	received on the Exchange Server. They are placed in the IMCDATA\OUT directory
	without sending any type of notification or NDR to the sender.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
