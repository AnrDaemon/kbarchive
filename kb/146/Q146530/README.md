	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you insert an OLE object, such as a *.BMP file, into the Windows 95
	Exchange client and edit the inserted object, you go back to the message view by
	clicking in the message body. In the message view, when you click the embedded
	object (to select the inserted OLE object) and then click the copy button, at
	that point the edited object reverts back to the original version.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
	4.0 Windows 95 client. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
