	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If your Organization display name is changed and replicated, it will not be
	changed in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program's contents window after
	refreshing (F5) the window.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Getting properties on the Organization after the change has replicated will show
	the change but refreshing the window will not show the change. The Microsoft
	Exchange Administrator's window for the connected server will have to be closed
	and then reopened for the change to appear.
