	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Because you can set appointments as Private, other users do not have access to
	see the details of the private appointment. For example, if other users open
	your calendar on a monthly view, they will see an asterisk (*) at certain places
	indicating private appointments or notes.
	
	However, if the same user opens your calendar on a daily view, the same asterisk
	is not displayed. Instead, a key is displayed indicating the field is locked,
	containing personal/private information.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
