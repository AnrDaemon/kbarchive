	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you drop a new rich entry field onto a newly created forms canvas and
	change the font size property of that rich entry field, when you reposition this
	field, the horizontal size of the field does not correctly resize to reflect the
	new font size. The height property of the field does correctly show the new size
	related to the new font size.
