	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) Setup program from disk using
	keystrokes to make your selections, the Setup program indicates it runs
	successfully; however, no files have been added to your hard disk.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Although the install button has the focus (indicated by the dark outline
	surrounding the button), when you press the ENTER key, the Setup program exits.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use the mouse to select the default install button (the one with the graphic
	icon in it), and click it.
	
	If your mouse is unavailable, you can use the spacebar to indicate your choice.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
