	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In a Microsoft Exchange Windows client, when you double click a public folder
	link it will start a second instance of the Microsoft Exchange client.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This happens when a link cannot open the public folder. The client will default
	to the stores view and you will get the following error:
	
	  The folder could not be opened. The client operation failed.
	
	This behavior is by design.
