	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you receive a mail message with an embedded Microsoft Excel attachment, you
	can print the message and attachment at the same time by selecting the Print
	Attachments options.
	
	However, when Microsoft Excel opens and loads the attachment to print, its print
	dialog appears and waits for your input. You must select the OK button on the
	Microsoft Excel dialog box to allow the print job to continue.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by product design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
