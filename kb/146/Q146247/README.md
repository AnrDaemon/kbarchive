	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In an unprotected section of a document protected for forms, the Automatic
	Spelling Checking (red wavy underlines) and Automatic Grammar Checking (green
	wavy underlines) do not appear under misspelled words or grammatical errors.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	
	Use one of the following methods to check spelling:
	
	Method 1: Use the Menu or Toolbar
	---------------------------------
	
	Use one of the following to proof the section:
	
	- On the Tools menu, click Spelling and Grammar.
	
	  -or-
	
	- On the Standard toolbar, click the Spelling and Grammar button.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Press F7 on the keyboard.
	
	NOTE: You cannot edit the misspelled word in the Spelling and Grammar dialog box
	while the form remains protected. You can still select one of the words from the
	Suggestions list in the dialog box and then select Change to correct the
	misspelled word. Or, you can click the misspelled word in the document and edit
	it there while the Spelling and Grammar dialog box remains open. Then click
	Resume in the dialog box to continue the spelling check.
	
	Method 2: Unprotect the Document
	--------------------------------
	
	To unprotect the document, follow these steps:
	
	1. Open the document that is protected for forms.
	
	2. On the Tools menu, click Unprotect Document.
	
	NOTE: Background Proofing now functions correctly in the previously unprotected
	section. The wavy lines show up. These features function correctly if the
	Background Proofing options are turned on. When the document is re-protected,
	any data in the form fields is lost.
	
	STATUS
