## Q146026: XCLN: Apply Button in Services Dialog Box Is Inactive

	Article: Q146026
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 4.0 5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you add or remove services in the Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 Client
	property page window, the Apply button is unavailable (gray).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. The standard property page has the OK, Cancel, Apply, and
	Help buttons. In this case, the Apply button is not applicable and is disabled.
	
	NOTE: The Help button is not present on every property page.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The removal of a service is a destructive operation that can not be undone.
	There is no Apply/Cancel metaphor so the Apply button is disabled.
