	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you insert an OLE object into a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95
	message and modify that OLE object, the object will return to its original state
	if you click the Copy button on the Toolbar or choose Copy from the Edit menu.
	
	If you send the message, the recipient will see the modified OLE object even
	though it appears to the sender as being the original object.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of the Microsoft
	Exchange client for Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
