	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When one user makes a recurring appointment with a second user, and the second
	user makes this recurring appointment private and tentative, the second user's
	private instance shows an accepted appointment and the first user's instance of
	this same appointment shows it as tentative.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design; an exception to a recurring appointment does not inherit any
	properties of the series.
