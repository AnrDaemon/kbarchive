	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you modify the background colors of a form in Microsoft Exchange Electronic
	Forms Designer (EFD), you might experience various screen refresh problems in
	the Color dialog box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you click on any of the basic colors in the Color dialog box for the
	background color, a white frame might remain around each color that was
	previously selected.
	
	Also, if you select a basic color or move the color intensity arrow (located on
	the far right side of the Color dialog box), the arrow might leave a white
	background in the Color dialog box and fail to repaint to the original gray
	color. In addition, the arrow for the color intensity scale might appear white,
	instead of black.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
