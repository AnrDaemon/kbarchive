	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you have text that is selected, and have enabled the bullet button, and
	then select the underline button, the entire selection is not underlined. The
	only areas that are underlined are the text itself and under the bullet itself.
	The area between the bullet and the text lacks the underline.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
	4.0 Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT clients. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
	becomes available.
