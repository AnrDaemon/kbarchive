	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use Microsoft Exchange Windows clients to address a message to a hidden
	recipient, the Check Names tool will not resolve the name.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The same behavior will occur when you try to send a message. The Microsoft
	Exchange Client will return the Check Names dialog box indicating Microsoft
	Exchange does not recognize the recipient's name. It will prompt you to create a
	new address or pick another user.
	
	You can send mail to the hidden recipient by either using the hidden recipient's
	X.400 address to create a custom recipient or placing the hidden recipient's
	Microsoft Exchange address in the Personal Address Book before hiding the
	recipient.
