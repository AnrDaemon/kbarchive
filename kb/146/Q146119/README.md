	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf for the Macintosh 1995 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Bookshelf, you receive the following error message:
	
	  Please insert the Microsoft Bookshelf '95 disc in the CD-ROM drive
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Some of the Bookshelf compact discs contain the wrong volume name. These discs
	are named "Bookshelf 95 for Mac X," rather than "Bookshelf '95."
	
	Because the compact disc is not correctly named, the program does not recognize
	that the disc is in the drive.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the 1995 edition of Bookshelf
	for the Macintosh. The problem has been resolved and systems are currently being
	shipped with the correctly named compact disc.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	When the disc is in the CD-ROM drive, the disc icon is displayed on the desktop.
	This icon should be named "Bookshelf '95." If another name appears with the
	icon, you need to order a new compact disc.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================

	computer systems. Bookshelf for the Macintosh, 1995 edition, may be one of these
	bundled products.
