	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Offline Address Book (.OAB) does not allow the off- line
	user to view all of the details that are available online.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you download the OAB (choose Synchronize on the Tools menu), the default
	option is Download Off-line Address Book. This option will only show the Display
	name, Department, Office, and Phone number under the General properties tab.
	(The OAB also includes the Business phone from the Phone/Notes tab.)
	
	
	The second option available when you download the OAB is Download Offline Address
	Book Without Detail Information. This option downloads the OAB without details
	and only provides the Display name.
	
	The OAB with details does not download the members of a Distribution List. Due to
	the large number of users that can be added to a single Microsoft Exchange
	Distribution List (5,000 members), the member list of a Distribution List is not
	downloaded to the OAB.
