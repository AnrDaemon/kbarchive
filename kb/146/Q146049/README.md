	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have been given access to another user's Schedule+ version 1.0 calendar
	file, you will lose access to the file when the user updates to Schedule+
	version 7.0.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. Schedule+ cannot migrate the permissions between the two
	versions of Schedule+.
