	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select a Project Name on the To Do tab, a line appears over the word
	Project. The other projects that are not selected do not have this line through
	the word Project.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Change the size of the grid's columns; for example, move the column separator
	between the check column and the description to the right away from the word
	Project. Now when the Project line is selected, the line will not appear over
	the word Project.
