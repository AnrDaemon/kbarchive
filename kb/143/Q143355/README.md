## Q143355: XCLN: Address Book Delete Button Not Unavailable

	Article: Q143355
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 4.0 5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbenv

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Exchange to initially access the Global Address List
	(GAL), the toolbar Delete button is displayed. If you then click the Delete
	button, nothing happens. When you select another address in the Global Address
	List, the Delete button is unavailable (gray).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you access the GAL, the Delete button is enabled for two reasons:
	
	- To delete the highlighted name in the Type Name or Select From List box
	
	- To edit the name in the Type Name or Select From List box
