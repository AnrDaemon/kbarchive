## Q143234: XCLN: Cannot View Bcc Information in Sent Items Folder

	Article: Q143234

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Outlook 97 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Exchange to read messages that are stored in the Sent
	Items folder, the Blind Carbon Copy (Bcc Box) menu command on the View menu is
	inactive and the recipient cannot see to whom the message was BCC'ed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. For security reasons, Microsoft Exchange does not display the
	users to whom the message was BCC'ed. The Bcc menu command on the View menu is
	only available in the Compose/Send Form.
	
	
	Additional query words: client Bcc'ed BCCed
