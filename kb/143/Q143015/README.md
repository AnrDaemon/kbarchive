	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a PowerPoint presentation to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500
	printer, the text on your slides may be printed as squares or symbols, or it may
	not be printed at all.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This can be caused by PowerPoint failing to recognize the HP DeskJet 500 printer
	when it is set as the default printer in Windows 95.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you print your presentation again, the text should be printed correctly
	because the second time you print the presentation, PowerPoint will recognize
	the printer and will adjust the HP DeskJet 500 printer settings.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
