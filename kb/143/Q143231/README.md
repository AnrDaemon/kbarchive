	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article tells how to make changes in text boxes mid-movie.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In 3D Movie Maker, text boxes persist from the frame you create them forward.
	For example, if you create a text box in Frame 10, the same box appears in Frame
	20. If you change the text in Frame 20, the change will also occur in Frame 10.
	However, you can make changes to text boxes mid- movie.
	
	To remove or change text boxes in a movie, do the following:
	
	1. Go to the movie frame where you want the text box to change.
	
	2. Click the Words tool window to get into Words mode.
	
	3. Click the Cut/Copy/Paste tool (scissors and glue).
	
	4. Click the Cut tool (scissors).
	
	5. Click any edge of the text box. (If you do not click on the edge of the text
	  box, the text box will not be removed.)
	
	This deletes the text box from this frame forward. If you want to change the
	text, you can now add a new text box with new text.
	
	For more information and a description of the Cut tool, see page 21 of the 3D
	Movie Maker "Roll'em" manual.
	
	NOTE: Do not confuse the Cut tool with the Remove tool. The Remove tool will
	remove the text box from all frames of the scene.
