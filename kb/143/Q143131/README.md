	- MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Windows NT Resource Kit version 3.51 utilities, PROBE.EXE and
	PROBEPRC.EXE, are not included in the first release of the Resource Kit.
	These utilities are included in the latest release of the Resource Kit but
	they will NOT run. The version of the PROBE utilities included in the 3.5
	version of the Resource Kit will work correctly on both NT 3.5 and NT 3.51.
	Contact Microsoft Technical Support if you need these utilities or load
	them from the 3.5 release of the Resource Kit.
	
	For more information on the PROBE utilities, refer to Appendix C of the
	Optimizing Windows NT Resource Guide. To obtain the latest release of the
	Resource Kit, contact Microsoft Sales and Information Center (MSIC) at
	(800) 426-9400.
