	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft 3D Movie Maker files are saved in a proprietary format (*.3mm). 3D
	Movie Maker files cannot be saved to a standard Audio Video Interleave (.avi)
	format.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Audio Video Interleave (.avi) is the technology that allows animation and video
	clips to be played on a PC under Windows.
	
	There are several reasons why .avi is not used by 3D Movie Maker:
	
	- Full size. 3D Movie Maker files are essentially events lists with pointers to
	  content (actors, backgrounds, sounds) that resides on the compact disc. This
	  feature allows hours of movies to be stored on a single floppy. If the movies
	  were stored as .avi files, even highly compressed .avi files, you wouldn't
	  get more than a very brief movie on a floppy disk.
	
	- Compression time. The time it would take to compress an .avi as efficiently
	  as possible is prohibitive. It would take several times longer to compress
	  and save a 3D Movie Maker movie than the movie takes to play.
	
	- Music/MIDI cannot be saved to an .avi file. Much of the richness of a 3D
	  Movie Maker movie would be lost without music.
