	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you attempt to run Setup for any of the programs listed at the top of this
	article, you are provided with the opportunity to register your program using
	"online" services.
	
	This option uses the Windows 95 Online Registration feature to call (dial) The
	Microsoft Network (MSN) and automatically add your product information to the
	registration database. When you use Online Registration, you are performing the
	same function as when you mail in the paper-based registration form.
	
	Any problems you experience with the Online Registration feature are handled by
	your designated Windows 95 support provider.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In lieu of using Online Registration, you have the option of mailing the
	Microsoft registration card included with the program package.
	
	The programs offer the choice of using Online Registration the first time you run
	Setup. If you rerun Setup, Online Registration will be an option. After
	successfully registering, Setup will no longer display this option.
	
	NOTE: Cinemania and Music Central display the option every time the program is
	started unless you click the No button. Completing the registration card is
	required if you click the No button.
	
	When you use Online Registration, you may receive error messages about your modem
	indicating the following problems:
	
	- No carrier detected
	
	- Unable to locate the SignUp Wizard message
	
	To resolve these problems, contact your Windows 95 service provider.
