	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can use the 32-bit PowerPoint Viewer to print a presentation. Note, however,
	that when you print from PowerPoint Viewer, you have fewer print options that
	you do in PowerPoint.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you use PowerPoint Viewer to print a presentation, you can only print
	slides (you can't print notes, handouts, or outline pages). Also, PowerPoint
	Viewer prints all of the slides in a presentation. In addition, if you print to
	a black and white printer, the slides are printed in black and white view.
	
	Note that even though the Print dialog box in PowerPoint Viewer has buttons for
	printing a partial slide range, the buttons are unavailable.
