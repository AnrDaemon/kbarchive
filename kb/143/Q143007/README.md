	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print slides to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 1200c printer, your
	printout may be incomplete, including only a portion of the slide. In addition,
	the following error message may appear on some or all of the pages:
	
	  Not Enough Memory - See User's Guide
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the presentation you are trying to print contains
	more information than the printer can handle. This is a limitation of the
	printer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	In order to print the presentation, you must add more memory to your printer or
	reduce the content of the presentation you are attempting to print.
