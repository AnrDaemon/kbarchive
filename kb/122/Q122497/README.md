	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are installing a software package, the computer stops responding
	(hangs).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Near the end of the installation process, most programs create a folder and
	icons. At times, this folder may be visible on the screen before the setup
	program is complete. If you close this folder before setup finishes, the system
	may hang.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, do not close the folder before the installation is
	complete.
