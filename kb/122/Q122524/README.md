	When running Windows NT 3.5 on a DEC Alpha 2100 with a Compaq QVision video
	adapter installed, you may experience random video problems, such as a blue
	cast which affects the entire desktop. The blue cast occurs randomly in
	systems with fast processors (like the Alpha 2100), and is caused by a
	timing problem on the Compaq QVision adapter.
	
	System performance is not affected. Only the video is distorted. You might
	be able to work around the problem by loading the 256 color bitmap.
	However, this is a temporary workaround, and the random problems are likely
	to persist. The only resolution is to replace the adapter. (Note: Since not
	all Compaq QVision adapters have this problem, simply replacing the adapter
	with a new one may resolve the problem).
