	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Haunted House for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Ultimate Haunted House should run on any Macintosh with 8 MB (8,192K) of
	RAM. However, if there is not 5,120K of memory free, regardless of the total
	memory, a warning message will be displayed indicating insufficient memory when
	you run The Ultimate Haunted House.
	
	Most users with 8 MB of RAM will not experience problems, but if your system
	software takes up more than about 2000K, you may need to adjust memory usage to
	make The Ultimate Haunted House run properly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Here are some general guidelines to follow when configuring your machine:
	
	1. Run only one application at a time. If other applications are running, close
	  them before restarting The Ultimate Haunted House.
	
	2. Check the amount of memory being used by your system software. To do this,
	  return to the Finder, select the Apple menu at top left of the menu bar, and
	  choose the first menu item, About This Macintosh. The Largest Unused Block
	  needs to be greater than 5120K to run The Ultimate Haunted House. If System
	  Software is the only item listed in the About This Macintosh dialog box, and
	  your Largest Unused Block is less than 5120K, you need to reduce the amount
	  of memory consumed by your system software.
	
	You should refer to your Macintosh documentation to perform the above procedure.
	However, here are some suggestions to follow:
	
	- Open the Memory Control panel and check the Disk Cache setting. For best
	  performance with The Ultimate Haunted House, set the cache to 32K.
	
	- Large numbers of fonts and sounds consume system memory. Removing those you
	  aren't using will make more memory available.
	
	- Third-party system extensions such as screen savers, fax software, desktop
	  pictures, menu-modifying utilities, and other system enhancements increase
	  the amount of memory consumed by your system. Removing some or all of these
	  extensions will increase the amount of memory available to applications. Be
	  sure that you save anything you remove from your System folder in a separate
	  folder on your disk so that you can restore it later.
	
	If you receive a memory error while running Byron Preiss Catalog, first try
	setting your monitor to 256 colors using the Monitors Control panel.
