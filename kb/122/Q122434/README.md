## Q122434: Windows 95 Does Not Have Drivers for RGDI, DGIS, TIGA Adapters

	Article: Q122434

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Windows 95 does not provide specific drivers for the following display
	adapters:
	
	- RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface)
	
	- DGIS (Direct Graphics Interface Standard)
	
	- TIGA
	
	When Setup is detecting the installed hardware, it detects these cards as
	VGA. If you were using a video driver for one of these cards in a previous
	version of Windows and you are performing an upgrade, Setup keeps the video
	driver you were using. If you are performing a new installation, Setup
	installs the standard VGA driver.
	
	Windows 95 can use the standard VGA driver or the Windows 3.1 drivers for
	these display adapters.
