	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Under Windows NT version 3.5, if you format a paragraph as Justified and print
	it with a PostScript driver, the words on a line with large spaces between them
	may incorrectly have spaces between the letters in the word, instead of between
	the words.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem on printers that are capable of both PostScript and
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL, use an HP PCL printer driver.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
	Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest
	U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
	Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
	(without the spaces):
	
	  S E R V P A C K
	
	PostScript and PCL are manufactured by Adobe Systems, Inc., and Hewlett- Packard
	Company, respectively, vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
	implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
