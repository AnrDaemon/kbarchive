	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The lyrics to the Magic School Bus theme song, which plays during the opening
	video sequences in The Magic School Bus series are detailed below. The theme
	song is sung by Little Richard.
	
	  Cruisin' on down Main Street
	  You're relaxed and feeling good,
	  Next thing that you know you're seein'
	  Octopus in the neighborhood?!
	
	  Surfin' on a sound wave
	  Then you're swingin' through the stars,
	  Take a left at your intestine
	  Take your second right past Mars
	
	  On The Magic School Bus, Navigate a nostril,
	  Climb on The Magic School Bus, Spank a plankton, too,
	  On our Magic School Bus (Raft a river of lava),
	  On the Magic School Bus (Such a fine thing to do)!
	
	  So strap your bones right to the seat,
	  Come on in and don't be shy
	  Just to make your day complete
	  You might get baked into a pie!
	
	  On The Magic School Bus,
	  Step inside, it's a wild ride!
	  Come on! Ride on The Magic School Bus!
