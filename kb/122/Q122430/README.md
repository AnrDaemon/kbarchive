	folder. If this item is not installed on your system, a warning message
	informing you that this extension is missing is displayed when you start The
	Ultimate Haunted House.
	
	To install QuickTime:
	
	1. Close any applications that are currently open.
	
	2. Locate and open the System Support folder on The Ultimate Haunted House CD.
	
	3. Drag the QuickTime extension to the System Folder on your startup disk. You
	  are then asked if you want to place QuickTime in the Extensions folder. Click
	  OK.
	
	4. Restart your computer.
