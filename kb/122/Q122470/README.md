	Article: Q122470

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Ancient Lands for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1994 edition 
	- Microsoft Cinemania, versions 1992 editions, 1994 editions 
	- Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Encarta 95 The Complete Interactive Multimedia Encyclopedia 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The following behaviors may occur in the applications listed above:
	
	- When you run a video clip, music clip, or dialog and then use the mouse to
	  click another item in the list, the list scrolls a page or two.
	
	- The mouse pointer does not snap correctly to the active default button.
	  Instead, it snaps to a location approximately 20 pixels below the active
	  default button. In some cases, the position it snaps to may actually be
	  outside the application window.
	
	- Whenever you close a dialog box, the cursor jumps to a blank spot about an
	  inch to the right of the Index button. This also occurs when you close
	  another application and Baseball 1994 regains the focus.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This behavior occurs if the Snap-To check box in the Mouse Manager for the
	Microsoft Mouse driver version 9.01 is selected. Clearing the Snap-To check box
	corrects the problem. (To do this, choose the Mouse icon in Control Panel, and
	clear the Snap To check box under Extra Points.)
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For more information about your mouse and turning off the Snap-To feature, refer
