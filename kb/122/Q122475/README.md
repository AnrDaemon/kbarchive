	If you encounter problems using Setup to install Microsoft Asimov, you can
	use the PSS.BAT file on the CD-ROM to perform a manual installation of the
	program. Follow the directions documented in the MSETUP.TXT file located on
	the <X>:\ASIMOV\MSSTP\MANUAL directory of your Asimov CD-ROM disk, where
	<X> is your CD-ROM drive.
	
	CAUTION: Do not use these steps if your are using Microsoft Windows 95
	or Microsoft Windows NT. The manual installation uses a batch file that
	copies Windows 3.x system files onto your hard drive. Allowing the system
	files to be overwritten in Windows 95 or Windows NT may cause improper
	system performance.
