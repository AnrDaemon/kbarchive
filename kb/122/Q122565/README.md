	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The linker (version 1.0, dated 23-Jun-1994) included with Microsoft FORTRAN
	PowerStation 32 interacts incorrectly with Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5, but
	works fine with Windows NT version 3.1.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the version of LINK.EXE
	(version 1.0, dated 23-Jun-1994) that shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN
	PowerStation 32 version 1.0 for Windows NT. To correct this problem, please
	obtain the new version of LINK.EXE (version 1.0, dated 9-Aug-1994) that corrects
	the problem and replace the old LINK.EXE.
