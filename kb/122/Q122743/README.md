	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot create mirrored text directly in PowerPoint. However, you can use
	Microsoft WordArt to create a graphic image of text that you can mirror using
	the Rotate Or Flip command.
	
	WordArt does not ship with PowerPoint 3.0. However, if you have WordArt installed
	on your computer, you can use a similar technique in PowerPoint 3.0. In
	PowerPoint 3.0 the Rotate/Flip command is located on the Object menu.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To create mirrored text with WordArt, follow tehse steps:
	
	1. On the Insert menu, click Object.
	
	2. In the list of available objects, click Microsoft WordArt 2.0.
	
	3. In the Enter Your Text Here box, type the text or character you want
	  mirrored. You can also select the font and size you want from the toolbar.
	
	4. Click outside the text area. This returns you to your PowerPoint slide.
	
	5. If you want to change the size of the text, click Scale on the Draw menu.
	
	6. On the Draw menu, click Ungroup. Click OK when you see the following
	  message:
	
	  This is an imported object, not a group. Converting it to a PowerPoint object
	  will permanently discard any embedded data or linking information it may
	  contain. Convert to PowerPoint Object?
	
	7. Each letter is selected individually. At this point you have two options:
	  either flip each letter in order or flip all the text. If you want to flip
	  all the text, click Group on the Draw menu.
	
	8. To mirror the text, click Rotate/Flip on the Draw menu (in PowerPoint 3.0,
	  the Object menu). Click Flip Horizontal.
	
	You will see a mirror image of your text.
	
	NOTE: When you ungroup a WordArt object, it becomes a picture. WordArt can no
	longer edit it.
