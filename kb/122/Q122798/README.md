	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use 16-bit graphic applications, such as CorelDRAW and PageMaker, in
	Windows NT version 3.5, graphic manipulation functions and printing may fail.
	Graphic manipulation functions include rotating and sizing of graphic objects.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when large number of fonts are installed, which creates
	additional processes.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, decrease total number of fonts installed to around 200
	or less.
	
	The CorelDRAW and PageMaker products discussed here are manufactured by Corel
	Systems Corporation and Aldus Corporation, vendors independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
	reliability.
