## Q122760: PC Win: Shared Folders View Cannot Be Expanded

	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the private folders can be
	expanded or collapsed. When the folders are fully expanded, the parent level
	folders show a minus sign (-), indicating they can be collapsed. When collapsed,
	the symbol turns to a plus sign (+).
	
	Shared folders in Mail for Windows cannot be manipulated like the private folders
	because the shared folder hierarchy can be changed by any of the Mail for PC
	Networks workstations (Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation; Mail for PC
	Networks, OS/2 workstation; or Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation).
	Because there was no easy way to track the expanded status of the folders at the
	client level, it was decided not to be included in any future releases or
	enhancements of version 3.2x of Mail for Windows.
