	The Lexmark 4033 printer family with network adapters support single and
	multiple network protocols under Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.
	
	Lexmark printer models 4033-01, 02, and 03 use Internal Network Adapters
	(INAs) that support a single proprietary protocol called Lexlink (follows
	IEEE 802.2 standards). In order for these network printers to be detected
	by Windows NT using DLC, network printer software with part number 1329980
	is required.
	
	Lexmark printer models 4033-201 and 202 (also called Lexmark Market XLE
	printers) support multiple protocols, such as TCP/IP, NWLink and Lexlink,
	if you use the network software shipped with the printer. These models do
	not require the network printer software (part number 1329980) to use the
	Lexlink protocol.
	
	To order any of the network printer software discussed above or for
	additional information about the Lexmark 4033 network printer family,
	contact Lexmark Technical Support at (606) 232-3000.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by Lexmark, a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
	regarding these products' performance or reliability.
