	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install the Windows Sound System 2.0 ProofReader in Microsoft Excel
	5.0, the On Entry command on the Proof menu does not display a check mark when
	it is activated.
	
	NOTE: No resolution or workaround is available at this time. However, the Proof
	On Entry feature does work normally despite the fact that the check mark is not
	displayed.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Windows Sound System
	version 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
