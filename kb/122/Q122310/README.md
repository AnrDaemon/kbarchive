	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51, the Server Viewer in Print Manager cannot
	open a print queue which is on that server itself. If you open Server Viewer and
	select the server you are currently on and then double- click one of the print
	queues, the following error message appears:
	
	  Could not connect to printer: The filename, directory name, or volume label
	  syntax is incorrect.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
	3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
