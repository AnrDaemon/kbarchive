	Chapter 12: Sweet Forgiveness Sample Site Not Available
	-------------------------------------------------------
	
	Throughout Chapter 12, "Developing an International Site", there are several
	references to the Microsoft Commerce Server 2000 sample site named Sweet
	Forgiveness. On page 335 of the book, the second paragraph indicates that the
	sample site is located on the Commerce Server 2000 Resource Kit CD. The online
	book refers to the same site being available at
	http://www.microsoft.com/commerceserver/default.asp.
	
	The site is not available at this time in either location.
	
	Microsoft Press has confirmed this to be a problem in the Commerce Server 2000
	Resource Kit. We are researching this problem and will post new information as
	soon as it becomes available.
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
