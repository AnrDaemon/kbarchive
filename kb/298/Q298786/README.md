	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You attempt to sign in with MSN Explorer 6.1 on a computer that has Internet
	Explorer 6.0 installed. A "Privacy Settings" dialog box appears, the message
	says, "In order to use the features of MSN Explorer, you must have a privacy
	setting that permits cookies?".
	
	At this point, you can do one of the following:
	
	- Allow MSN Explorer to change the privacy settings to Medium.
	
	- Read more information regarding privacy settings.
	
	- Cancel the sign-in process.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This error occurs when you have the privacy settings of Internet Explorer 6.0
	set above the Medium level. MSN Explorer requires the use of "cookies" in order
	to function properly, and these cookies may be restricted when Internet Explorer
	6.0 privacy settings are set above the Medium level. For information about the
	default Privacy settings in Internet Explorer 6, please see the following

	Internet Explorer 6.0
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To change the privacy settings to a level acceptable by MSN Explorer, click the
	"Yes" button on the box when prompted to "Allow MSN Explorer to change the
	privacy settings to Medium". This will set the privacy settings of Internet
	Explorer 6.0 to Medium. If you wish to read more information regarding security
	settings and cookies, click the More Information button in the box that displays
