	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use either of the products listed in the "Applies to" section of this
	article, operations related to the Find and Find Places commands may be
	unavailable (dimmed).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if Microsoft Internet Explorer is not properly updated,
	which can occur if the user chooses not to install all of the Internet Explorer
	components.

	To resolve this issue, install the needed components from the Internet Explorer
	CD-ROM. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Insert Streets and Trips CD 1. Hold down the SHIFT key to prevent the compact
	  disc from automatically running.
	
	2. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	3. In the Open line, type the following
	
	  <CD-ROM>:\MSMap\Redist\Common\50comupd.exe
