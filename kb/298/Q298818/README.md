## Q298818: SMS: Duplicate SNMP Traps Sent on Windows 2000

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you enable the Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Event to Trap
	Translator Client Agent for a site that contains Microsoft Windows 2000-based
	client computers that are running the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
	service, traps that are generated by events which are configured for alerts may
	be sent twice to defined management stations.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The default Windows 2000 SNMP installation includes an Event to Trap Translation
	Extension Agent, which is implemented in a .dll file that is named Evntagnt.dll.
	The SMS 2.0 Event to Trap Translator Client Agent installs an additional
	extension agent that provides duplicate functionality implemented in a .dll file
	that is named Snmpelea.dll. Both of these DLLs monitor the Windows 2000 Event
	log according to the rules that are defined in the following registry key:
	
	  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SNMP_EVENTS
	
	When a configured event is written to the Event log, each extension agent
	generates a trap for it.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, you can disable the SMS 2.0 Event to Trap
	Translator Client Agent for sites that include Windows 2000-based clients that
	are configured with SNMP.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 2.0.
