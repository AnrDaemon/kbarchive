	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You have started MSN Explorer and you are viewing a Web page. You then type
	another Web address (URL) into the address bar, but you do not press ENTER or
	click Go. Instead, you click the Refresh button. The page you are currently
	viewing will refresh, but the address bar will still display the URL that you
	typed--the address displayed will not match the page displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known issue in MSN Explorer and the product team working to correct
	it.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To view the URL of the page that you are currently viewing
	
	1. Click the Back button (which looks like an arrow pointing to the left).
	  This displays the previous page
	
	2. Click the Forward button (which looks like an arrow pointing to the right) to
	  return to the page.
	  The correct URL now appears in the address box for the currently displayed Web
	  page.
