	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have used the (now discontinued) DellNet Internet service, you may have
	received a notice inviting you to migrate to DellNet by MSN Internet Access.
	When you installed the DellNet by MSN software, instead of creating a new MSN
	Internet Access account, you may have selected your old DellNet dial-up
	connection as the connection device. For this reason, you can no longer access
	the Internet.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The old DellNet connection was selected mistakenly when the DellNet by MSN
	software was set up.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You can create a new MSN Internet Access account through the DellNet by MSN
	software.

	  account created.
