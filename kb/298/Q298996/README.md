	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Zone.com, when you click Play after you install Asheron's Call, the program
	connects to the Asheron's Call Web site and begins updating your installation of
	Asheron's Call. This update to the program can be large and may take a long time
	to download. This article explains more about this update.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The copy of Asheron's Call that you install from the CD-ROM may not be the most
	recent version. Changes and additions are made as often as every month, with new
	lands, monsters, quests and dungeons to explore. Asheron's Call is automatically
	updated to the most recent version when you click Play in Zone.com.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Depending on your connection speed, it can take one or more hours for Asheron's
	Call to automatically update itself. If you have trouble staying connected to
	Asheron's Call long enough for the automatic update to complete, browse to the
	following Zone.com Web site to manually download and install the most recent
	patch: http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/downloads.asp
