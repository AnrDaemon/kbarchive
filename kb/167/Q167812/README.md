	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) and Dynamic
	Host Protocol Configuration (DHCP) Server Service have a new feature that
	dynamically compacts their databases. This is in addition to the jetpack utility
	which was also in previous versions of Windows NT and is not a replacement for
	jetpack.
	
	Windows NT 4.0 dynamic compacting decreases the frequency for which the jetpack
	utility is needed. The jetpack program is still a feature of Windows 4.0. For
	more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
