	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0 does not include Msremind.exe. Msremind.exe is a
	separate executable for Schedule+ 1.0 that shows pop-up reminders for an
	appointment, without the user running Schedule+.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use reminders in Schedule+ 7.0 or Outlook, you must run the Schedule+ Client
	or Outlook Client. The reminders feature is currently built into the Schedule+
	product and is not available as a standalone executable.
	
	This is by product design.
