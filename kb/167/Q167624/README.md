	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you open a WordPerfect 5.x master document in Word 97, you may receive the
	following error message if the subdocuments do not have a .doc file name
	extension:
	
	  An unexpected error has occurred.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	WordPerfect does not require .doc file name extensions. File name extensions for
	documents in WordPerfect are optional.
	
	If a WordPerfect subdocument does not have a .doc file name extension, then Word
	does not know how to handle the document.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Rename the WordPerfect subdocuments so that they have a .doc file name
	extension.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
