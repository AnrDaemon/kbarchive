	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you display the Web toolbar, the Web address area on the toolbar may be cut
	off, and the full address may not be displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when you set the screen to use a low resolution (640 x 480)
	and when you use a large font to display the menus in Windows.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
	
	Method 1: Change the Screen Resolution and Font
	-----------------------------------------------
	
	Change the screen resolution to a setting larger than 640 x 480, or change the
	menu fonts to a smaller font or smaller font size.
	
	For more information about changing the display resolution, click Start on the
	Windows taskbar, and click Help. Click the Index tab. Type "display, resolution,
	changing" (without the quotation marks), and click Display.
	
	Method 2: Move the Web Toolbar
	------------------------------
	
	You can move the toolbar from its docked position to a floating position. This
	may allow you to see more of the URL.
	
	For more information about "moving toolbars," click the Office Assistant, type
	"floating toolbars" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click
	"move a toolbar."
	
	NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
	Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
	following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When the default menu font is used in Windows, the display area should be wide
	enough to display the entire toolbar. The default font is MS Sans Serif or
	Tahoma. This problem is more likely to occur with the Microsoft Plus Pack for
	Windows 95 because you can use the Plus Pack to change the theme settings for
	your Windows environment. Some theme settings use larger font sizes that are
	more likely to cause this problem. The font size can be changed manually by
	changing the appearance settings for Windows. To change the font size, follow
	these steps:
	
	1. Right-click the desktop.
	
	2. On the shortcut menu, click Properties.
	
	3. Click the Appearance tab.
	
	4. In the Item list, click Menu.
	
	5. Select a smaller font or font size, and click OK.
