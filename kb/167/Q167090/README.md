	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	PowerPoint does not have any built-in feature to record to videotape. However,
	there are a number of third-party products that you can use to create a
	videotape based on your presentation. This article describes some of the ways
	you can make a videotape of your PowerPoint presentation.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Before you begin, you should consider the following:
	
	- Video uses an analog signal that is both fuzzier and lower resolution than
	  the digital signal used by your computer to display information on your
	  monitor. Do not use tiny or finely detailed text or graphics in your
	  presentation.
	
	- Information close to the edge of the screen may be cut off. Do not place text
	  close to the edge of your slide.
	
	- Some colors, such as bright red, do not display well on video. Avoid using
	  bright reds and yellows in your presentation.
	
	To videotape your PowerPoint presentation, use either of the following methods.
	
	Method 1: Use a Scan Converter
	------------------------------
	
	A scan converter is a device that converts the VGA or SVGA signal that the video
	adapter on your computer produces into an NTSC signal that a television or home
	videocassette recorder (VCR) can understand. There are numerous models, brands,
	and qualities of scan converters on the market. A scan converter does not
	usually require any software drivers; you plug it into the monitor and then plug
	your television or videocassette recorder into the scan converter. There is
	usually a way to plug your computer monitor into the scan converter as well;
	what you see on the monitor is sent to your television or VCR.
	
	1. Install your scan converter using the instructions that came with it.
	
	2. If your presentation contains sound, connect the Speaker or Line Out jack on
	  the sound card in your computer to the Audio In jack on your VCR.
	
	  NOTE: To complete this step, your computer must have a sound card and you must
	  obtain the proper cable (usually a cable with a mini- plug on one end and an
	  RCA plug on the other).
	
	3. Press the Record button on your VCR.
	
	4. Run your PowerPoint presentation.
	
	  The VCR records the slide show.
	
	Method 2: Use Digital Video Editing Software and Hardware
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	Digital video editing offers a more advanced method for creating videotapes from
	your computer. This method uses a card that either replaces or works in concert
	with the video adapter card in your computer. The card has outputs for several
	different types of video signal and also may have inputs for several different
	types of video signal. Some examples of this type of card are the Wakeboard by
	Digital Video Arts, the AV/Master by Fast, and the Bravado 1000 by True Vision.
	To control this card you need some type of video editing software, such as
	Premiere by Adobe Systems, Inc. or Lumiere by Corel Corporation.
	
	You also need a videocassette recorder to hook into your video board.
	
	If you have this kind of hardware and software installed on your computer, you
	can take MPEG or QuickTime movies or use images stored in a number of formats
	and record them to videotape.
	
	1. PowerPoint can save presentations as a series of graphic files. The supported
	  formats are GIF, JPEG, PICT, or PNG formats. If you have an earlier version
	  of PowerPoint, you can use a screen-capture utility to save each slide as a
	  graphic file.
	
	2. If you have a program that lets you create a QuickTime movie of what happens
	  on the screen, you can use that to create a movie file of your presentation.
	
	3. Use your digital video editing software to send your graphic or movie files
	  to your VCR.

	of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
	products' performance or reliability.
