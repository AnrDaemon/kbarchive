	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	From the Windows NT 4.0 Windows.hlp Help File (Workgroups | To join a workgroup)
	the last paragraph states:
	
	  "If you're working from a computer running Windows NT Server, you cannot join
	  a different workgroup. Reinstall Windows NT Server to join a different
	  workgroup."
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This statement is incorrect. It should say that Windows NT Servers CAN join
	different workgroups or domains without reinstalling.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT version 4.0
	WINDOWS.HLP file. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
