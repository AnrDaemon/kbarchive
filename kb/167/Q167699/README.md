## Q167699: Underlining of Hyperlinks Unavailable in Windows Messaging

	Article: Q167699
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 4.0,95
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbtool

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you add a hyperlink (such as http://www.microsoft.com) to a mail message,
	the link is not underlined and you cannot click the link to go to the site that
	is referenced.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows Messaging does not include the ability to automatically underline
	hyperlinks. Windows Messaging is a basic mail client included with Windows 95
	and Windows NT 4.0 without the full feature set available in other products.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Update Windows Messaging with Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Exchange, or use
	Microsoft Outlook Express, for the automatic underlining of links and the
	ability to click a link to go to the site.
