	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you cross-reference text containing an inline object, the field shading for
	the cross-reference field will appear as though there are two separately shaded
	fields separated by an unshaded inline object. That is, the inline object breaks
	up the field shading.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This is a display problem only, and it does not affect the functionality of the
	field.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================

	these steps:
