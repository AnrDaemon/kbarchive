	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print from Windows NT Diagnostics (WINMSD) on a Compaq Proliant 2500 or
	5500 computer with the boot drive formatted as NTFS, drive C may be reported as
	being a total size of 0 KB with 0 KB free.
	
	For example:
	
	  C:\  (Local - NTFS)  Total: 0KB, Free: 0KB
	  Serial Number: 389F - A803
	  Bytes per cluster: 512
	  Sectors per cluster: 1
	  Filename length: 255
	
	This only affects the printout. The GUI details are still correct.
