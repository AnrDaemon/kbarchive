	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes several methods you can use to improve game performance
	in Microsoft Golf.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To improve game performance in Golf, use the following methods:
	
	Quit Unnecessary Programs
	-------------------------
	
	To increase the amount of available resources on your computer, quit all programs
	that are running before you start Golf.
	
	Disable Extra Game Features
	---------------------------
	
	The Game Sounds, Commentary, Shadows, and Auto Flyby features can reduce game
	performance if your computer meets or only barely exceeds the minimum system
	requirements to play Golf. To disable these features, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Options, and then click Game Preferences.
	
	2. Click the box beside each feature to change it from Yes to No.
	
	  NOTE: You may want to leave the Commentary feature enabled if game performance
	  is satisfactorily improved by turning off the other features.
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	For information about the minimum system requirements to run Golf, see one of the
	following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
