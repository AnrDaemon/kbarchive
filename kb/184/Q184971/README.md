	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outwars, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Outwars, music in the game may start and stop, or the
	music volume may abruptly change.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the volume levels for wave audio and CD audio do not
	match.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
	
	1. Insert the Outwars CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, and then start Outwars.
	
	2. On the Outwars startup screen, click Options.
	
	3. Click Sound.
	
	4. When the Sound Options screen opens, you hear the wave audio. Under
	  Interactive Music Balance, click the left or right Wav Music arrows to set
	  the volume level you want for the wave audio.
	
	5. Under Interactive Music Balance, click the CD Music volume control. When you
	  do so, you hear the CD audio. Click the left or right CD Music arrow to
	  adjust the volume level for the CD audio to match the volume level for the
	  wave audio.
	
	  NOTE: When you set both the wave and CD audio to the same volume level, the
	  Wav Music and CD Music volume controls are not necessarily set to the same
	  numeric value.
	
	6. If both the CD and wave audio do not play, click the right Master Volume
	  arrow to increase the volume level in the game.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The interactive music system used by Outwars combines the CD and wave audio to
	match the action in the game.
