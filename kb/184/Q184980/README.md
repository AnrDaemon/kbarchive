	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word, the Send To command on the File menu attaches the current
	document as a Word 97 document in a mail message, even if the file is saved in a
	non-Word format or earlier Word version. This problem occurs when you have the
	Mail As Attachment option selected in the General options dialog box. (To locate
	the Mail As Attachment option, click Preferences on the Tools menu, and then
	click the General tab.)
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To mail a file in a format other than Word, save the file in that format from
	Word, and then attach the file to a mail message from within your mail program.
