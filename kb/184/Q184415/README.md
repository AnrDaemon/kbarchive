	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Word, the HTML converter can only save using the US/Western
	European code page.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Microsoft Excel, you can save an HTML file any of the following code pages;
	however, this capability does not currently exist in Microsoft Word:
	
	- US/Western European
	- MS-DOS United States
	- MS-DOS Multilingual (Latin I)
	- Japanese (EUC)
	- Japanese (JIS)
	- Multilingual (UTF-8)/KSC 5700
	
	Further, the Word HTML converter does not currently support the character sets
	ISO 8895-2 (Polish) or KOI8-R (Russian).
	
	KOI8-r is widely used on Russian Internet sites. Though the proposed character
	set KOI8-R is not currently an international standard, there is a very large
	user community supporting it for UNIX and global network programs in the former
	Soviet Union.
