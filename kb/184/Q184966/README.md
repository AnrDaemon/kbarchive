	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To use the high-resolution golf courses when you play Microsoft Golf , you must
	install a display adapter that supports 16-bit color (High Color) in your
	computer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you start Golf, the program automatically attempts to switch your
	computer's display settings to 800 x 600 screen resolution and 16-bit High
	Color. If your display adapter cannot dynamically switch display settings, you
	may experience problems such as a black screen.
	
	To prevent these problems, configure your display settings to match those used by
	Golf before you start Golf. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Display.
	
	3. Click the Settings tab.
	
	4. Move the Display Area slider to the 800 x 600 position.
	
	5. In the Color Palette box, click High Color (16-bit).
	
	6. Click OK. If you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.
	
	If High Color (16-bit) is not an available selection in the Color Palette box,
	contact your hardware manufacturer to inquire if an updated video driver that
	supports a 16-bit color palette is available for your video adapter.
