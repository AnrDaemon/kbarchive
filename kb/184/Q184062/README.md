	Microsoft Outlook leaks memory. The memory leak can exhaust all resources on the
	computer on which Outlook is running. Outlook.exe also remains in memory after
	the application is finished. The only way to free the memory is to end the
	OUTLOOK task from the task manager.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, upgrade to Microsoft Outlook 98.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Outlook clients
	listed above.
