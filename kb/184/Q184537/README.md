## Q184537: Very Large Files Cause Performance Problems

	Article: Q184537
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): WinNT:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400sp4fix
	Last Modified: 09-AUG-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some user interface (UI) features, such as deleting files and viewing the
	properties of files, do not work. Also, the use of the WIN32 API, SetEndOfFile,
	generates inconsistent results.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Windows NT user interface handles large files, for example, 200 to 300 GB,
	as buffered files rather than nonbuffered files. When a file is opened in a
	buffered manner, the system attempts to load the file into memory which it
	cannot do due to the size of the file.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
