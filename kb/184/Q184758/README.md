	IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
	Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
	a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
	the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
	Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may receive a STOP 0x00000078 if the NonPagedPoolSize registry setting is
	more than seven-eighths of physical memory.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, change the registry setting so that the
	NonPagedPoolSize value is less than seven-eighths of physical memory.
	
	WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
	require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
	problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
	Registry Editor at your own risk.
	
	For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
	Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
	Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
	Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
	you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
	(ERD).
	
	1. Run Registry Editor and open the following key:
	
	  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
	  \Session Manager\Memory Management
	
	  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.
	
	2. Change NonPagedPoolSize to less than seven-eighths of the physical memory.
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
