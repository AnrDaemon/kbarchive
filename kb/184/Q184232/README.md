	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you open an application or service in the DCOM Configuration Utility
	(Dcomcnfg.exe) whose name is displayed as a CLSID number, the service name in
	the Services tool in Control Panel may be inadvertently changed to the CLSID.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The APPID name for the service is the CLSID and DCOM saves this APPID name into
	the services configuration database.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========

	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
	Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Normally, services use the same name for the APPID as it does for the Services
	display name and does not use the CLSID. So, when this name change in the
	services configuration database occurs, it is transparent.
