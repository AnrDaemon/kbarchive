	- Microsoft Windows 95

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to create a "paste link" (a method for pasting information from one
	document to another using Object Linking and Embedding, OLE) between two
	Microsoft WordPad documents, you are unable to do so.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The ability to create a "paste link" requires an OLE server program. Because
	WordPad is not an OLE server program, it does not support the "paste link"
	functionality.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, do not try to create a paste link between two Microsoft
	WordPad documents.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
