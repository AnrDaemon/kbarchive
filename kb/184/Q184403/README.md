	This article describes how to reset the list of user names that appear in the
	recently used file list on the File menu in Microsoft Schedule+.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The recently used file list keeps track of the last four appointment books that
	you opened. The names in the list, like all other personal settings in Microsoft
	Schedule+, are stored in the your .VUE file, which is located in the Windows
	directory. Although you cannot remove individual entries from this list, you can
	reset the entire list.
	
	To reset or clear this list of user names, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Options.
	
	2. On the Display tab, click to clear the "Show recently used file list" check
	  box.
	
	3. Click OK. The list no longer appears on the File menu.
	
	4. On the Tools menu, click Options.
	
	5. On the Display tab, click to select the "Show recently used file list" check
	  box.
	
	The Recently Used File List now appears again and contains only the current
	user's name.
