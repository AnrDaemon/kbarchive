## Q171099: PRB: Per-Recipient &quot;Send Options&quot; Not Saved to Address Book

	Article: Q171099

	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A new feature in Microsoft Exchange version 5.0 is the ability to save options
	for a recipient in your personal address book, like the format for messages. If
	you are creating an application such as a fax gateway, you might want to save
	information like a default cover sheet. You can create customized templates for
	entering these send options. These templates will appear and allow you to set
	options for that recipient when you choose "Send Options" in your personal
	address book. However, when you try to look at these options for your gateway
	recipient they will not be saved.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	It should be noted that if you have an SMTP address and set the send options,
	they will be saved. The option available for SMTP addresses is message format
	(MIME or Plain Text/UUENCODE).
