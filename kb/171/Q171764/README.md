	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Package Command Manager (PCM) for the Macintosh does not open its window
	when a new package is received. The icon in the top right corner of the
	Macintosh screen flashes to indicate that it has received a new package.
	
	The Systems Management Server 1.2 Administrator Guide, page 140, states that "if
	there are new packages available for the user to install, the Package Command
	Manager window appears."
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the documentation of Systems
	Management Server version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
