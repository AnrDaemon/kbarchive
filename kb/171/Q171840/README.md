	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After loading one project file (.VBP) and proceeding to load a second project
	file, Visual Basic 5.0 reports that the second project is corrupted and cannot
	be loaded. However, the second project opens fine if opened by itself and no
	message about a corrupted project file appears.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In rare cases, Visual Basic incorrectly reads the project file, which causes
	this error.

	beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
