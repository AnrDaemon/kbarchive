	- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Macintosh 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to view an article in Bookshelf 98, you may notice a long pause
	as the CD-ROM drive makes strange noises, and you may receive one of the
	following error messages:
	
	   - Cannot open articles file.
	
	   - Cannot open books file.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if your CD-ROM drive has problems reading the Bookshelf
	CD-ROM.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, make sure your CD-ROM drive is able to access all of the
	files on the Bookshelf CD-ROM. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Examine the silver side of the Bookshelf CD. If you see any noticeable
	  scratches, the compact disc may be damaged.
	
	  If you think you have a damaged compact disc, you can exchange it. If your
	  local retailer will not exchange the damaged CD-ROM, contact Microsoft Sales
	  at 800-360-7561 to obtain a replacement CD-ROM. You can also order it online
	  at:
	
	  http://parts.microsoft.com
	
	  If the new CD-ROM also has the same problem, your CD-ROM drive may not be able
	  to access all of the files on the Bookshelf CD-ROM.
	
	2. Clean the Bookshelf CD-ROM. To do this, use a CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently
	  wipe the silver side of the CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do
	  not use paper cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you
	  clean the CD-ROM, wipe from the center of the disc outward; do not use a
	  circular motion.
	
	3. Verify that other CD-ROM programs function properly on your computer.
