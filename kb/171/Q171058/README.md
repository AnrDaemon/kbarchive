	Microsoft provides no-charge Microsoft-sponsored Network News Transfer Protocol
	(NNTP) newsgroups on the Internet as part of a family of Information Services
	offerings. This service boosts Microsoft's Internet presence and further
	addresses customer demand for one-stop information and services over the
	Internet. Microsoft is investing in the newsgroups to create a community in
	which customers can share technical information about Microsoft products and
	technologies. Microsoft Newsgroups can be accessed by any newsgroup reader,
	including Microsoft Internet News, which is included with Microsoft Internet
	Explorer 3.0.

	The Microsoft-sponsored newsgroups offer peer-to-peer interaction on the
	Internet. Microsoft does not offer any formal support in the newsgroups.
	Instead, Microsoft sponsors the newsgroups as a platform for participating in
	the global community of Microsoft customers and product experts. In addition,
	Microsoft monitors the newsgroups to ensure accuracy of information and assists
	MVPs as needed.
	
	Microsoft MVPs (Most Valuable Professionals) provide technical answers and
	expertise in the newsgroups. The Microsoft MVPs come from a wide range of
	backgrounds and professions, with a willingness to give their time, expertise,
	and advice to enhance the technical skills of other customers within the
	newsgroups.

	server msnews.microsoft.com. No user name or password is required to access this
	server. The following newsgroups are available for you to post your questions
