	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Bookshelf 98 includes several 360-degree views in which you may pan
	around to view a scene from a wide range of seamless views, much like your
	turning around in a circle at a particular location. Not only can you look in
	all directions, but you may also tilt the view up and down.
	
	Unlike its Windows counterpart, the 360 degree views for the Macintosh version of
	Bookshelf 98 do not have ambient music. In the Windows version, 360 degree views
	with ambient music are indicated by a speaker symbol within the 360 degree view.
	Regardless, the Windows and Macintosh products contain the same scenes for 360
	degree views.
