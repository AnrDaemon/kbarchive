## Q171959: Mac Bookshelf 98: Text and Images Not Copied at Same Time

{% raw %}

	Article: Q171959
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): MACINTOSH:
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbmm kbusage

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Macintosh 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to copy an entire article from Microsoft Bookshelf containing
	both text and at least one image, or a combination of text and image(s), you are
	unable to paste both types of media.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Macintosh Clipboard is only able to handle one type of media at a time, and
	defaults to copying whichever type of media appears first in the article.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To copy both text and images from Bookshelf into another program that can handle
	both media types, you need to copy them separately. To do so, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Open the article you want to copy, and then select the text you want to copy.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.
	
	3. Switch to the application where you want to paste the text, and then click
	  Paste (or equivalent) on the Edit menu.
	
	4. Return to Bookshelf and locate the image you want to copy.
	
	5. Press and hold down the CTRL key, and then click and hold down the mouse
	  button over the image. Click Copy on the menu that appears.
	
	6. Switch back to the application into which you want to paste the image, and
	  then click Paste (or equivalent) on the Edit menu.
