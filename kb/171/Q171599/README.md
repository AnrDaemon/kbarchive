	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	While you are typing an AutoText entry, the AutoComplete feature does not show
	the AutoComplete tip for certain entries.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when you type any of the following default AutoText
	entries:
	
	  Love,
	  Respectfully yours,
	  Respectfully,
	  Sincerely yours,
	  Sincerely,
	  Thanks,

	  -PAGE-
	  Confidential, Page#, Date
	  CONFIDENTIAL
	  RE:
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To insert the AutoText entry, follow these steps:
	
	1. Place the insertion point in the desired location.
	
	2. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText. Point to one of the AutoText submenus
	  and then click the desired AutoText entry.
	
	For example, when you are typing "Sincerely yours" in a document, Word should
	show an AutoComplete tip containing "Sincerely yours." However, this tip does
	not appear. To work around this problem, point to AutoText on the Insert menu,
	point to Closing, and then click on Sincerely Yours.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use the AutoComplete feature, type the first few characters of an item. For
	example, type "augu" (without the quotation marks). When Word suggests "August,"
	press ENTER, TAB, or F3 to accept it. To reject the item, simply continue
	typing. You can automatically complete the following items:
	
	- The current date
	
	- A day of the week
	
	- A month
	
	- Your name
	
	- AutoText entries
	
	To turn the AutoComplete feature on or off, point to AutoText on the Insert menu,
	click AutoText, and then select or clear the "Show AutoComplete tip for AutoText
	and dates" check box.
	
	For more information about AutoComplete, click the Office Assistant, type
