	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can use the Undo command in Windows Explorer to undo recently performed
	Windows Explorer operations.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To undo a recent operation in Windows Explorer, you can click the Undo command
	on the Edit menu, or you can click Undo on the toolbar. You can undo the
	following types of operation:
	
	- Deleting a file, folder, or shortcut.
	
	  NOTE: You can undo a delete operation only if the deleted item is in the
	  Recycle Bin. If you delete an item using the SHIFT+DELETE method, the item
	  you are deleting is not placed in the Recycle Bin.
	
	- Moving a file, folder, or shortcut.
	
	- Pasting a file, folder, or shortcut.
	
	Windows Explorer can undo only the last 10 operations. Note that when you undo an
	operation, the most recent operation is undone. For example, to undo the second
	operation out of the last three operations, you must undo the third operation
	first.
