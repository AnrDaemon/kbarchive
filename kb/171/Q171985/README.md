	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MSN Internet Access offers the RSACI (Recreational Software Advisory Council)
	rating system. You can use the RSACI rating system to decide which MSN
	programming is suitable for viewing, just as you would use movie ratings to
	decide which movies are suitable for viewing.
	NOTE: MSN Internet Access uses Internet Explorer's Content Advisor for managing
	ratings. Content Advisor settings apply to all users on the local machine and
	cannot be changed by users who are not administrators on the local machine
	(Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 only). You cannot create different Content
	Advisor settings for different users on the same machine.

	To limit the content that users of your computer are allowed to view on MSN and
	the Internet, follow these steps
	
	1. Click View on the Internet Explorer menu bar, click Internet Options, and
	  then click the Content tab.
	
	  NOTE: For Internet Explorer 5.0, click Tools, Internet Options, and then the
	  Content tab.
	
	2. In the Content Advisor section, click Enable.
	
	3. Think of a password you will easily remember and type it in the Password box,
	  retype it in the Confirm Password box, and then click OK.
	
	4. On the Ratings tab, click Language, and then use the Rating slide bar to
	  choose the type of content you want to restrict.
	
	5. Repeat for the other 3 categories, then click OK.
	
	Once you've set your initial ratings, you can change them at any time by simply
	clicking the Settings button on the Content tab of Internet Options.
	
	You can turn off Content Advisor at any time by following steps 1-3 above, then
	clicking the Disable button. You will need to type in your Supervisor Password
	then click OK to complete the process.

	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Internet Options and click the Content tab.

	  time you attempt to view unrated content.
	
	5. Click OK until you return to Control Panel.
