	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some ATL controls may run in a compiled executable but generate the following
	error when run in the Visual Basic design environment:
	
	  "VB5 caused an invalid page fault in module VB5.EXE at 0137:00464736"
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Visual Basic assumes that the control hooks itself to the IPropertyNotifySink
	connection point, but some ATL controls do not implement that connection point.
