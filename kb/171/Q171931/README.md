	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the process for obtaining a replacement CD-ROM or
	diskette for any Microsoft Press companion CD-ROMs and floppy disks.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If your CD-ROM or floppy disk is clearly physically defective (cracked, badly
	warped, contains a deep scratch, etc.), you can exchange it for a replacement
	CD-ROM or floppy disk in the United States of America by calling Microsoft Press
	at 800-MS-PRESS.
	
	If you are outside the United States of America, please contact your local
	Microsoft Press distributor or subsidiary. For a list of distributors, please
	connect to the Microsoft Press Web site at
	
	  http://mspress.microsoft.com/
	
	and look for the English Language Distributors list.
	
	IMPORTANT: Replacing the CD-ROM or floppy disk will not solve any software
	related issues. Therefore, replacement should be considered only if the Setup
	program fails and if there are no other known problems posted on the Microsoft
	Press Support Web site at:
	
	  http://mspress.microsoft.com/support/
	
	Unfortunately we currently cannot provide replacement disk contents via the Web
	due to legal considerations. However, individual file patches are posted on the
	Internet when appropriate. Please refer to the Microsoft Press Support Web site
	for further information.
	
	If you need further assistance obtaining a replacement disc, please e- mail
	MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM.
