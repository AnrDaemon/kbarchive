	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	LJNBold.exe contains MS Word document files that show the proper bolded text in
	the code samples from the Microsoft Press book titled, "Learn Java Now," by
	Stephen R. Davis. Several code samples in "Learn Java Now," by Stephen R. Davis,
	should have included bold text indicating code that had been changed from a
	previous sample. However, this boldface type font does not appear in the book.
	
	The affected code samples begin on each of the following pages:
	
	  231, 239, 261, 270, 281, 301, 316, 325, 327
