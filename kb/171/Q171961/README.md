	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Microsoft Bookshelf with your computer configured to utilize more
	than one monitor, you may experience unexpected problems.
	
	For example, if the Bookshelf program window is open on your secondary monitor,
	other windows (such as Advanced Search or Bookshelf Daily) may open on the
	primary monitor. The Books menu that allows you to select which books you are
	searching in may also exhibit this behavior.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for
	Macintosh. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
