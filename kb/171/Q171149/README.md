	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Page xxxiii states that to install the sample files on your hard disk, you
	should run d:\samples\setup.exe. This file is not present on the CD-ROM.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can still install Microsoft Internet Explorer by running Setup from the Ie30
	folder. You can also still view the contents of the book, including the sample
	files, by using your Web browser to view CONTENTS.HTM in the root folder of the
	CD-ROM.
	
	For further information about the contents of this CD-ROM and how to install or
	access it, please read the README.TXT file included in the root folder of the
	CD-ROM.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To install the sample files on your hard disk, follow these steps:
	
	1. Insert the "Running Microsoft Office 97" CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.
	
	2. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.
	
	3. In the left pane, click the letter of your CD-ROM drive.
	
	4. Drag the Samples directory from your CD-ROM drive to your hard disk.
	
	NOTE: The files and folders in the Samples folder will be marked Read-Only. To
	change them, you need to save the files to a different file name, or change the
	attribute of the files in the folder by doing the following:
	
	1. In Windows Explorer, select the \samples\files folder on your hard disk.
	
	2. Type CTRL+A to select all the files in the folder.
	
	3. Right-click anywhere in the selected area. Note that a menu appears.
	
	4. Click Properties.
	
	5. Make sure the Read-Only check box is cleared, and then click OK.
