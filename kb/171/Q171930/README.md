	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The first edition of the Microsoft Internet Information Server Training ISBN:
	1-57231-425-7, was written for Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
	version 2.0. Microsoft has since released Internet Information Server versions
	3.0 and 4.0, which the kit does not cover.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Information on the differences between Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0
	and the later versions can be found by using the following steps:
	
	1. Point your browser to the following address:

	2. For information about version 3.0, in the left frame, click Product Guide,
	  and then click Past Versions.
	
	3. For information about version 4.0, in the left frame, open Product Guide (if
	  the topic is not already open) and then open Datasheet or White Papers.
	
	Note that the steps to navigate to these pages may be slightly different if you

	Microsoft Press is aware of this limitation. Currently, Microsoft Press is
	preparing a new edition of the Microsoft Internet Information Server Training
	Kit that will be current with the latest edition of Microsoft Internet
	Information Server. We are also preparing a Resource Kit for use with the latest
	edition of Microsoft Internet Information Server.
