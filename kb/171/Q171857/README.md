	Article: Q171857

	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you add WordPad to the Send To menu, and then use the WordPad command on the
	Send To menu to activate a file with a long file name, the file's 8.3 alias is
	displayed in the title bar of the WordPad window. If you then use WordPad to
	save the file to a different location, the file's long file name is lost.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, save the file to the same location instead of
	saving it to a different location. When you save the file to the same location,
	the long file name is not lost. After you save the file, you can use My Computer
	or Windows Explorer to copy or move the file to a different location.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the WordPad tool included with
	the Windows versions listed above. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
