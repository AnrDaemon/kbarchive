	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The license agreement in the first printing of the "Microsoft Windows NT
	Workstation Resource Kit" version 4.0 incorrectly states that the Resource Kit
	utilities are covered by a single-use license.
	
	This license agreement is printed on the last paper page and has been corrected
	in later printings to provide a site license.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The license agreement provided on the last paper page of the Microsoft Windows
	NT 4.0 Workstation Resource Kit states the following in the "agreement"
	section:
	
	1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants to you the right to use one copy of the
	  Microsoft software program included with this book (the "SOFTWARE") on a
	  single terminal connected to a single computer....
	
	This single-use license agreement is incorrect. The Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
	Resource Kit CD-ROM is actually covered by a site license agreement. The Windows
	NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit, which contains the same utilities plus additional
	utilities, correctly states the following key license information:
	
	1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants to you the right to install and use copies
	  of the Microsoft software program included with this book (the "SOFTWARE") on
	  computers you own....
	
	NOTE: The above excerpt is not an official written license agreement for any
	Microsoft or Microsoft Press product. There are other changes to the license
	agreement wording that are not listed here.
	
	For the correct Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Resource Kit license agreement, please
	refer to the Windows NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit license agreement. If you do not
	have the Windows NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit, please contact Microsoft Press
	through e-mail at MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM or send a letter request to:
