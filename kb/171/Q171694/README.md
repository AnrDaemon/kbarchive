	This article describes the difference between the Recycle Bin and the Recycler
	folder.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you delete a file in Windows NT Explorer or My Computer, the file is stored
	in the Recycle Bin. The file remains in the Recycle Bin until you empty the
	Recycle Bin or restore the file.
	
	The Recycler folder is used only on NTFS partitions. The Recycler folder contains
	a Recycle Bin for each user that logs on to the computer, sorted by their
	security identifier (SID).
