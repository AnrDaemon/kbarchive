	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to delete a custom form if there are multiple forms
	with the same name in a public folder.
	
	If a custom form is created with the same name as an existing form, the duplicate
	will appear in the public folder. Also, the user will have a duplicate entry
	when creating a new form. Each entry will call a separate form.

	To resolve this, on the Tools menu, click Options. Click Exchange Server, and
	click Manage Forms. Click Set, and point to the public folder. Delete the bottom
	instance of the duplicate; it is the older one.
