	Drives that appear in Microsoft Windows File Manager can be accessed in Word by
	specifying the correct drive letter in the file name.
	
	For example, if you map a Banyan Vines drive as drive E:, it does not appear in
	the Look In list in the Open dialog box. However, you can view the files on
	drive E: by typing "E:" (without the quotation marks) in the File Name box and
	pressing ENTER.
