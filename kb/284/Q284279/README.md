	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MSDN Subscriptions no longer contain an installable index to find specific
	products within the subscription CD-ROMs. The index CD now contains an index in
	the form of a Microsoft Access database for reference.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The best resource for this information is through the MSDN Subscription Online
	CD Index:
	
	  http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/index/default.asp
	  (http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/index/default.asp)
	
	The alternative is to view the index from the Development Platform CD1 under the
	Index folder on versions of the MSDN Universal or Professional Subscription
	prior to January 2001 and within the Index CD for January 2001 and later.
	
	Additional query words: vs6, vssetup, msdnlib
