	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you run the Microsoft Works, Publisher, or Kids demos on a system using a
	Diamond Stealth video card and driver, a general protection (GP) fault may
	occur. This problem occurs with the Diamond Stealth VRAM version 2.0 video
	driver.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, contact the manufacturer of your display adapter to
	inquire about obtaining the latest version of the video drivers.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This card will not run with the standard SVGA video driver or with the S3
	version 2.1 driver. If you configure Windows to use either of these drivers, and
	then try to exit and restart to make your changes take effect, Windows will not
	be able to load.
