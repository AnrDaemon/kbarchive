	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	At the point when the External program, Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), included with
	versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, has to generate
	undeliverables if the original message body contains any highlighted color
	attributes in the text. They will not be retained when the original sender
	receives the returned mail along with the system message indicating
	undeliverable status.

	================
	
	Steps to Reproduce
	------------------
	
	1. In the MS-DOS client or Monitor utility, included with Mail for PC Networks,
	  send mail including highlighted text to a remote user or invalid external
	  postoffice alias ensuring that you have set pre-established variables to
	  cause the retry count to be exceeded. For remote transfer configurations, the
	  retry count setting can be altered within the ADMIN.EXE application via
	  Ext-Admin, Setup, Options.
	
	  Mailing retries before failure. The default value for this option is 3.
	
	2. Shortly, afterwards you should receive an undeliverable message generated by
	  External. Opening this system message will display your text without its
	  original highlighted color attributes.
