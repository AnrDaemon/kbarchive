	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	With Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, if you use the NET SHARE command to share your
	printer and you then change to the floppy disk drive by typing A: or B:, the
	light for the floppy disk drive stays on until you type a drive letter other
	than the letter of the floppy disk drive you are currently using.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS
	version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION

	files on the new disk.
