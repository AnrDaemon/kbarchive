	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Office Developer's Kit (ODK) 
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Encore example program, which is included on the Microsoft Office
	Developer's Kit (ODK) version 1.0 CD-ROM that ships with the Professional
	Edition of Visual Basic version 3.0, was designed to work with two Microsoft
	Project version 4.0 files (ENCORE!.MPP and GLOBAL.MPT). Because the ODK CD was
	released before Microsoft Project version 4.0 was available, the ENCORE!.MPP and
	GLOBAL.MPT files were not included on the CD-ROM.
	
	The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
	Center:
	
	  Odkpr4.exe

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use the Microsoft Project version 4.0 files with the Encore example, copy
	ENCORE!.MPP and GLOBAL.MPT to the Encore example code directory. The Encore
	example code in ENCORVBA.XLS will look for the ENCORE!.MPP and GLOBAL.MPT files
	in its directory and enable the Microsoft Project version 4.0 functionality if
	it finds them.
