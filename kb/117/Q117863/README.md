	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you run Encarta on a Macintosh with a monitor smaller than 13 inches, the
	Anatomy images and dialog boxes may be cut off on the right side. The system
	requirements list in the Encarta README.TXT file specifies that Encarta needs a
	12-inch or larger monitor, but the Anatomy pictures do not display correctly on
	a 12-inch screen.
	
	If you attempt to run Encarta 97 for the Macintosh on a machine with a 12- inch
	monitor (512x384 pixels) you will receive the following error message:
	
	  Encarta requires a minimum monitor resolution of 640x480 pixels to run
	  properly. You will not be able to access all parts of Encarta when running on
	  smaller screens.
	
	When Encarta launches, you will notice that you cannot see a large portion of the
	application when run on computers with a 12-inch monitor (512x384 pixels). With
	Encarta 1997, the entire program will be displayed incorrectly, not just the
	Anatomy section as in Encarta 1994. This problem will occur with Encarta 1995
	and Encarta 1996 as well.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta 1994, 1995
	editions and Encarta Encyclopedia 1996, 1997 editions. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here as it becomes available.
	
	NOTE: All other graphics should display correctly on a 12-inch monitor. This
	problem has only been found to occur with the Anatomy images.
