	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a graphic from Encarta to a LaserWriter, you may find that a
	thin, white line appears horizontally across your printout. This is most likely
	to occur when you print a 256-color fractal with the Black & White option
	selected.
	
	NOTE: The Black & White or Color/Grayscale options are selected in the
	LaserWriter dialog box. This dialog box appears when you click the Printer
	button at the bottom of a picture and choose to print the image.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This problem occurs when printing with the LaserWriter 7.1.2 printer driver. To
	eliminate this problem, upgrade to version 8.1.1 or later of the LaserWriter
	printer driver.
	
	To obtain the updated printer driver, contact your local Apple dealer or call
	Apple at (408) 996-1010.
