	FILES AVAILABLE FROM ONLINE SERVICES
	------------------------------------
	
	Item ID   Filename       Description
	-------   --------       -----------
	
	S14817    WINQ&A.EXE     The WINQ&A.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        "Windows Q & A" column by Matt Pietrek.
	
	S14819    CPPQ&A.EXE     The CPPQ&A.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        "C/C++ Q & A" column by Paul DiLascia.
	
	S14818    WIN32QA.EXE    The WIN32QA.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        "Win32 Q & A" column by Jeff Prosise.
	
	S14815    LONGNAME.EXE   The LONGNAME.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        article named "Unconstrained Filenames on the PC!
	                        Introducing Chicago's Protected Mode FAT File
	                        System," by Walt Oney.
	
	                        Finally, the 8.3 MS-DOS filename restriction has
	                        been lifted. Thirty-two-bit applications now have
	                        full access to the file system functionality. For
	                        legacy programs, a set of INT 21H functions has
	                        been added that allows 16-bit code to access files
	                        with long names.
	
	S14816    CONTROL2.EXE   The CONTROL2.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        article named "Chicago's Interface Gadgets, Part
	                        II: Toolbars, Status Bars and the RichEdit
	                        Control," by Dave Edson.
	
	                        Although toolbars and status bars are not new to
	                        applications, new Common controls in Chicago make
	                        them much easier to implement. The new RichEdit
	                        control can format characters and paragraphs, can
	                        print preview and print, and is OLE-compliant.
