	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are distributing an application created with FoxPro for Macintosh, you
	may need to distribute the Apple Shared Library Manager (ASLM) with the
	application. For example, if the application calls Macintosh libraries created
	with the FoxPro for Macintosh Library Construction Kit (LCK), the Apple Shared
	Library Manager must be distributed with the application in order to take
	advantage of these features.
	
	To legally distribute the ASLM with FoxPro for Macintosh applications, you must
	obtain a license from Apple Computer. To apply for a license, call the Apple
	Legal Department at (408) 974-4667, or send a request to the sw.license alias on
	AppleLink.
	
	NOTE: Some products mentioned in this article are manufactured by vendors
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	these products' performance or reliability.
