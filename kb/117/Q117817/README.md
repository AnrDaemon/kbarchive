	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If your Macintosh has a small monitor (13 inches, for example), the cast lists
	in Cinemania may wrap and align incorrectly. To display the text fully on a
	small monitor, Cinemania may need to wrap cast lists that include long names.
	Wrapped text does not align correctly.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Cinemania 1994 for the
	Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
