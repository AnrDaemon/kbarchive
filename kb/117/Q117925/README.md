	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you pause an animation that has an accompanying soundtrack, the sound may not
	resume when you resume playback of the animation. If the animation contains more
	than one sequence, the sound may start playing again at the beginning of the
	next sequence. Depending on the length of the animation and the point at which
	you paused it, the sound may take anywhere between a few seconds to a full
	minute to begin playing again.
	
	This behavior is due to a limitation of the MacroMedia Player.
