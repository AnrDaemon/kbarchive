	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Cinemania Demo's appearance is significantly less attractive if you run it
	on a monochrome system. The demo will run only on color or true monochrome
	systems, not on color systems on which the monitor has been set to monochrome
	mode.
	
	If you set a color system to black and white and try to run the Demo, the
	following message appears:
	
	  This demo requires 256 colors or more.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The system requirements list on the Cinemania box and in its readme file
	specifies that Cinemania requires a 13-inch or larger monitor running 256 or
	more colors to run correctly.
