	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) will not deliver mail to external users
	in groups created on postoffices other than your local postoffice if the mail is
	mailed from your postoffice.
	
	For example, a group with external users in it is created on one postoffice (PO1)
	and the group is exported to another postoffice (PO2), that group will show up
	in PO2's network address list and will be included in the GAL. If Mail is sent
	to that group from PO2, the external users will not receive the mail message.
	The sender will not receive any error messages; the recipients just will not
	receive that mail message.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	For the workaround, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
	Base:
