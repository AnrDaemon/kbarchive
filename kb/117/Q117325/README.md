	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The C++ Tutorial is no longer included in the documentation supplied with
	Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.5, or Visual C++ 32-bit Edition. The
	tutorial is no longer available in printed form and does not appear in the
	Books Online supplied with these packages. NOTE: The C++ Tutorial will
	still be available on MSDN Level 1 or 2 Developer CDs.
	
	Previously, the tutorial was included with Microsoft C/C++, version 7.0,
	and with Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0. Because there are currently
	many third-party books available about C++ programming, the tutorial is no
	longer provided. Two such books available at this time are:
	
	- "C++ Primer," Stanley B. Lippman, published by Addison Wesley.
	
	- "The C++ Programming Language," Bjarne Stroustrup, published by Addison
	  Wesley.
