	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you try to install Macintosh Cinemania under System 6.0, the system may stop
	responding (hang) when you run Setup. This problem occurs if the system
	components, such as Sound Manager and QuickTime, have not been previously
	installed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, use Cinemania with version 7.0 or later of the Macintosh
	System software. Macintosh Cinemania requires System 7.0 or later to run
	correctly. The Cinemania product box and CD booklet both include this in the
	list of system requirements.
