	- Microsoft Video for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a video clip or any graphic image is the active window, the palette for
	that image is applied to the entire screen. This changes the appearance of other
	items currently displayed on the screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If two or more graphic files with different palettes are displayed at the same
	time, the screen flashes as the active palette is applied to the graphic in the
	inactive window. If the two palettes are very different from one another, the
	inactive window looks distorted.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only way to prevent this problem is to use the same palette in all images
	that are viewed simultaneously on the screen.
