	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The COMMAND+PERIOD key combination generally behaves the same as the ESC key.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Early Macintoshes that do not have an ESC key on their keyboard use
	COMMAND+PERIOD to interrupt a process or close a dialog box or window.
	
	NOTE: Unless the SET ESCAPE, ON ESCAPE, or ON KEY LABEL command has been issued,
	pressing the ESC key (or COMMAND+PERIOD) in FoxPro interrupts program and
	command execution, or closes the open dialog box or window.
