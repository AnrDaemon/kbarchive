## Q117816: MacCinemania 94: Cannot Pause and Restart Sounds

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You cannot pause and then restart sounds in Cinemania for the Macintosh. If you
	click the Sound icon to play a sound, and then click it again, the sound stops.
	When you click the Sound icon a third time, it begins playing from the beginning
	instead of from the point where you stopped it. This behavior is inconsistent
	with Cinemania for Windows. In the Windows version of Cinemania, you can pause
	and restart the playback of sounds.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994
	edition. The pause feature was added to Cinemania 95 and later versions.
