	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	With Microsoft Client Service for Netware, you can set printing options that
	control form feeds, print notification, and banner pages. By default, the form
	feed is suppressed and you are notified after your print job is completed and an
	initial banner page is printed. The printing option settings are equivalent to
	those available directly on the NetWare server using the capture utility.
