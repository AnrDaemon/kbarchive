	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Dear Customer:
	
	This Customer Service Disk Set contains version 1.00a of the Microsoft
	TrueType Font Pack for Windows. We've localized the font style names (such
	as bold and italic) for this version and will include localized font style
	names in all future versions of the TrueType Font Pack. Since we've made no
	other changes from version 1.0, you only need to install version 1.00a if
	you wish to see the font style names in a language other than English.
	
	The font style names will now appear in whatever language you've chosen in
	the Windows Control Panel International dialog box. If you use Windows in
	English, the font style names will still appear in English. If you choose a
	different language in the International dialog box, the font style names
	will appear in that language. However, the localized font style names will
	appear on your screen only if you change your language setting before you
	install fonts from TrueType Font Pack version 1.00a. Chapter 5 of the
	"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" contains instructions on changing your
	language setting.
	
	Before installing the localized font files, you must remove the fonts you
	installed from version 1.0 of the TrueType Font Pack. Remove only the fonts
	listed below; do not remove any other fonts. Chapter 5 in the "Microsoft
	Windows User's Guide" contains instructions on adding and removing fonts.
