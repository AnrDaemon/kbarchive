	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Cinemania for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use the PopChar control panel while Cinemania is running, your machine
	may stop responding (hang). This is a problem with versions 2.3 through 2.6.2 of
	PopChar, and occurs if you select any of the characters in the "More" feature of
	PopChar while Cinemania is running.
	
	This problem is corrected in version 2.7 of PopChar.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, do one of the following:
	
	- Use version 2.7 of PopChar.
	
	- Disable PopChar before running Cinemania.
	
	- Avoid the "More" feature of PopChar while running Cinemania.
	
	NOTE: PopChar 2.7.1 was released in September of 1995; most users who have this
	control panel should have this version or newer.
