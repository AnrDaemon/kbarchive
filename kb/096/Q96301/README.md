	To create a multiple-page format file, do the following:
	
	1. To create a multiple-page input form, first design two separate screens.
	
	2. Generate the screens.
	
	3. Open the resulting .FMT format files. (From the File menu, choose Open, and
	  then choose the Program button.)
	
	4. After both format files are open, activate the screen that represents page 2.
	  From the Edit menu, choose Select All to select all the program code, and
	  then choose Copy from the Edit menu.
	
	5. Activate the screen that represents page 1. Select the line after the last
	  line of code in the generated screen. Type "READ" (without the quotation
	  marks) and then press ENTER. From the Edit menu, choose Paste.
