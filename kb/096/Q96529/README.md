	Mail Remote for Windows ships in the United States with three separate Help
	files:
	
	- MSMAIL.HLP: The standard Help file for Windows Mail.
	
	- MSRMT.HLP: The online Help file for remote mailing issues.
	
	- RMTPSS.HLP: A Help file created with information from calls to Microsoft
	  Product Support Services to aid with specific issues about using the product,
