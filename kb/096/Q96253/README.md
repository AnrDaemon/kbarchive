	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Although the workstation of version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks
	is compatible with Apple's A/UX environment, the server is not compatible.
	Earlier versions of the Mail workstation are not compatible.
	
	The only known problem with A/UX and the version 3.1 workstation is that the
	chime will only sound once on the arrival of new mail, even if set to 2 or 3
	chimes.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail
	for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
