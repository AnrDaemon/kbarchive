	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	DoubleSpace supports disk compression on both floppy disks and removable media
	disks; however, when you swap a floppy or removable media disk you must remount
	the disk.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This information does not apply to later versions of MS-DOS and DoubleSpace.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To mount a disk from the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following:
	
	  " dblspace /mount drive " (without the quotation marks)
	
	where "drive" is the drive location of the disk.
	
	Automation of this feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion
	in a future release.
	
	NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows, you cannot remount floppies or
	removable media.
