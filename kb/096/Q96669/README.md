	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you install the TrueType Font Pack 2, it installs a file called FAST.BAK
	(dated 11/18/92) to the TT_TOOLS subdirectory. This is the default FAST.INI
	file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To re-create a default FAST.INI file, do the following:
	
	1. If there is a current FAST.INI file, rename it "FAST.XXX."
	
	2. Copy the FAST.BAK file to the FAST.INI so that the original FAST.BAK file is
	  available for future use.
	
	If there is no FAST.INI file and you start the Font Assistant, it creates a
	minimal FAST.INI file, but the default groups are not listed.
	
	The FAST.IN_ and the FAST.BA_ files can also be expanded from the original disks.
	Both files are located on Disk 1 of the 3.5-inch disk set and Disk 2 of the
	5.25-inch set.
