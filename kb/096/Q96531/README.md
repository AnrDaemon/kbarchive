	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows without being
	connected to the network, you cannot initiate a meeting request with version 1.0
	of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows.
	
	You can receive and respond to meeting requests, but they will not automatically
	be booked in the calendar file.
	
	If the Schedule+ Reminders utility is used with multiple mail drivers, the
	sign-in prompt may be generated twice.
