	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you rename your Windows or Windows for Workgroups directory in File Manager,
	Windows can no longer find necessary files, device drivers, and command
	libraries. Immediately after you rename your Windows directory, Windows becomes
	unstable and does not allow you to save your work or quit Windows. To restore
	Windows to its working state, use the following steps:
	
	1. Turn off your computer (or press the reset button).
	
	2. After you restart your computer, use an MS-DOS utility (such as MS-DOS Shell)
	  to rename the Windows directory to its original name.
	
	After following the above steps, Windows should work normally.
