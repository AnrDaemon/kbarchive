	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The server for versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks is
	incompatible with Apple CD-ROM drivers versions 3.1 and earlier. If this driver
	and a CD-ROM drive are added to a Mail server, the computer will stop operating
	after startup.
	
	The CD-ROM driver prevents the normal operation of the Mail server to read and
	write in the background to the hard disk. This configuration is not supported in
	Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks.
