	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Fuji Golf is a computer simulation of an imaginary golf course. The object of
	Fuji Golf is to play the 18 holes of the course in as few strokes as possible.
	You are competing for position in a tournament with 39 other players whose skill
	levels range from beginner to professional. Game play changes each round because
	particular factors such as wind are randomly generated.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	As in real golf, each hole has a par rating, and tournament scores are based on
	the number of strokes above or below par that you have accumulated.
	
	Fuji Golf automatically selects clubs for you. This club choice is based on ideal
	conditions, hence, you may want to change this selection.
	
	Fuji Golf also automatically selects a shot direction for you. This is indicated
	by the white line in the Overhead View located on the right side of the screen.
	Should you need to change the shot direction, move the mouse pointer into the
	Overhead View, or the area in the center of the screen called the Shot View.
	When the mouse becomes a golf ball, click and hold the mouse button down, then
	drag the mouse to a new direction.
	
	The wind gauge is located in the lower-right corner. The larger the arrow, the
	more severe the wind.
	
	To initiate a stroke, start your backswing by clicking the Backswing button. This
	will start the red power meter. To hit the ball, click the same button. The
	higher the power meter, the further the ball will go.
	
	Note: Fuji Golf is designed to be played by one player at a time. Attributes of
	the player other than the name may not be changed. Any name in the player list
	may be modified by opening the file FUJIGOLF.DAT into a text editor and changing
	the name list.
