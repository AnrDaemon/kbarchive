	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you install the MS-DOS Upgrade on a machine running Dell DOS version 3.3, you
	may be unable to access all your partitions after you upgrade your computer.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you have already installed the MS-DOS Upgrade and you cannot see all your
	partitions, restart your computer with the Uninstall disk in drive A to
	uninstall MS-DOS.
	
	To work around this problem, back up your data, repartition your hard disk drive,
	install the MS-DOS upgrade, and then restore your data.
	
	For specific instructions on repartitioning your hard disk drive without losing
	data, see the "Repartitioning Your Hard Disk" section in following article in
