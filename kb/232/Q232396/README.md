## Q232396: XCON: Content Conversion Failure, Reroute to Another Server

{% raw %}

	Article: Q232396
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:5.5
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): exc55 EXC55SP3Fix
	Last Modified: 30-SEP-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When an outgoing X.400 message fails content conversion, it may be re-routed to
	another server in the site that has an X.400 connector with a suitable address
	space.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The logic behind this process is that another route may not require the same
	content conversion and so the message may get sent.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
	version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base:
