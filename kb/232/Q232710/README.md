## Q232710: Privileges not Assigned if Two Users Start with Same Substring

	Article: Q232710
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0 SP4
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 includes the Security Configuration
	Editor (SCM). A template defines a collection of security settings, including
	the ability to modify a user's privileges (user rights).
	
	In a template, if two users or groups starting with the same substring are
	granted the same privilege, only one of two users or groups is effectively
	granted the privilege when the template is applied to the system.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the two groups "Users" and "Users2" in the above
	example both start with the same substring (Users). SECEDIT handles Users2 and
	then ignores Users because it thinks it has already been handled.
