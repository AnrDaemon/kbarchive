## Q232311: LPD Job May Cause TCPSVCS to Hang

	Article: Q232311
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you send a print job by using LPR to a TCP/IP print server, the TCP/IP
	print server may stop responding (hang) and causes over 90 percent CPU usage in
	TCPSVCS.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if the print job contains a value of 0x1B (ESC) at offset
	0xFFF (4095). TCPSVCS has a routine to detect PCL or PostScript jobs; this
	routine enters an infinite loop under these conditions.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to

	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, service pack that contains
	this fix.
