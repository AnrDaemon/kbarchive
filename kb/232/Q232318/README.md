	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to one-off address a message to a user on PROFS.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To one-off address a message to a PROFS user:
	
	1. From the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client, compose a new
	  message.
	
	2. In the To box, type the address in the following format:
	
	  "[PROFS:NODEID(USERID)]" (without the quotation marks)
	
	NODEID and USERID are addressing components of a PROFS address, each of which can
	contain up to eight characters. NODEID is similar to a post office (or just a
	grouping of users); USERID is similar to a username.
	
	For example:
	
	  [PROFS:MICROSFT(JOHNDOE)]
