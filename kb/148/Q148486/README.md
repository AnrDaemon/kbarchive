	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you double-click the map of China in the Bookshelf Atlas, the Country Fact
	Box opens. If you click the pronunciation or anthem icon and play the sound, the
	Fact Box closes.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	The behavior is by design and not a problem with Bookshelf.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The China Country Fact Box is formatted differently than most Fact Boxes. When
	you play a sound, the China Fact Box closes. If you play a sound in the Mexico
	Fact Box, the Fact Box does not close.
