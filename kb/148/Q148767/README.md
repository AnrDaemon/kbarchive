	IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT MICROSOFT RETURN OF ARCADE
	*****************************************************************
	Welcome to Microsoft Return of Arcade!
	
	Here's some information to help you install Microsoft Return of Arcade
	on your computer, as well as some tips on getting the most enjoyment
	from the games.
	
	------------------------------
	BEFORE SETUP: Hard Drive Space
	Microsoft Return of Arcade requires at least 11 megabytes of free disk
	space on your hard drive to install.
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	SETUP: How to Install Microsoft Return of Arcade on Your Computer
	To set up Microsoft Return of Arcade:
	
	Turn on your computer and start Windows 95.
	Insert Microsoft Return of Arcade Disk 1 in the 3.5-inch disk
	drive, usually drive A.
	Double-click the My Computer icon, then double-click the icon for
	the 3.5-inch disk drive.
	Double-click the Setup icon.
	
	It can take a while for all the computer code behind these awesome
	games to be decompressed and transferred to your computer's hard
	drive. So, sit back and relax . . . before the great arcade battles
	begin.
	
	---------------------------------------
	BEGINNING TO PLAY: Just Point and Click
	To start Microsoft Return of Arcade:
	
	Click the Start button, then point to Programs.
	Point to Microsoft Games, then point to Return of Arcade.
	Click the icon of the game you want to play.
	
	------------------------------------------
	LEARNING TO PLAY: Quick Help and Full Help
	As soon as you open a game for the first time, an abbreviated Quick
	Help is displayed to provide basic instructions on how to play the
	game.
	
	For a more complete guide to the games, including strategies, hints
	and detailed scoring information, click Contents on the Help menu or
	press F1.
	For stories about the creation of the games, click History of the Game
	on the Help menu.
	
	----------------------------------------------------
	CUSTOMIZING THE GAMES: Create Your Personal Versions
	The Options menu for each game offers a Player Controls command that
	allows you to choose between playing the game with  keyboard controls
	or a joystick. You can also customize the keys you use to control the
	game and in Pole Position, you can adjust your mouse sensitivity.
	
	The Customize Game command lets you customize the playing speed and
	other game variables to create your own personalized versions of the
	games.
	
	---------------------------------------
	SOUND: A Listing of the Supported Cards
	Microsoft Return of Arcade captures the original sounds of these
	classic games, which nicely enhances the playing experience.
	
	Microsoft Return of Arcade uses DirectSound, which supports the
	following sound cards:
	
	- Sound Blaster:  8-bit cards, 16-bit cards, and the AWE32.
	- ESS: 488, 688, 1488, 1688.
	- MediaVision: PAS 16, PAS Studio, PAS Plus, Pro 3D, and Blue Lite
	Special.
	- Aztech: Nova 16, Washington 16, Rocky 2.
	- Microsoft: Windows Sound System.
	
	If your sound card is not listed above, you might experience
	sound delays while playing the games.
	
	The Adlib Gold 1000 is not supported. While sound will work,
	performance may be poor.
	
	Faults have also been encountered in certain situations on the
	Roland Rap 10 and the Gravis UltraSound MAX.
	
	To turn the sound on or off, click Sound on the Options menu.
	When the game sounds are turned on, a check mark is displayed
	next to the command name.
	
	-------------
	VIDEO DISPLAY
	Microsoft Return of Arcade requires a Super VGA video card set to
	at least 256 Color.
	
	------------------------------------------------------
	GAME PERFORMANCE: How to Get the Fastest Screen Action
	Here are some tips for maximizing the speed of the game action:
	
	Decreasing the size of the game window increases the speed of game
	changes seen on the screen. The larger the window, the more your
	computer must work to update the game screen. The game window is
	resized by clicking the mouse on the lower right corner, and holding
	the mouse button down while moving the cursor toward the upper left
	of the screen. If playing a game, the game must be paused before the
	window can be resized.
	
	Decreasing the number of colors used for your video display can
	increase performance. You must use a setting of at least
	256 Color (8 bit). Depending upon your computer, this minimal setting
	may offer higher performance than settings of High Color (16 bit) or
	True Color (24 bit). To select a color setting, click the Start
	button,then point to Settings. Point to  Control Panel, then click the
	Display icon. Click the Settings tab in the Display Properties dialog
	box, and choose a new color palette setting.
	
	Turning off sound (which is done from the game's Options menu) can
	also increase game performance.
	
	Turning off skidding in Pole Position can increase performance. To
	turn off skidding, click Customize Game on  the Options menu, or press
	F9. Set Car Skidding to Off.
	
	If you are using the Aztech Sound Galaxy Washington PCI sound card and
	are experiencing performance problems, try disabling your joystick
	control.
	
	---------------------------------
	SOME GENERAL NOTES
	Microsoft Return of Arcade was designed for Windows 95 (and later)
	operating systems. Setup will not install onto Windows NT, Windows for
	Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11, or Windows 3.1 and 3.11.
	
	If you don't have a sound card or if your sound card is not working,
	your joystick will not operate.
	
	When Microsoft Return of Arcade is running, sounds from other
	applications will not be played. For example, if you have an e-mail
	program that chimes upon receipt of a new message, the chime will not
	be heard, even if your game is paused and minimized.
	
	Screen savers will not activate while running Microsoft Return of
	Arcade, even if a game is paused or minimized.
	
	In Pole Position, the car can be steered using the keyboard, mouse, or
	joystick. Members of the Microsoft Return of Arcade production team
	favor the mouse for steering, finding this the easiest way to score
	points. To adjust mouse sensitivity, click Player Controls on the
	Options menu, or press F8.
	
	Pole Position and Dig Dug have High Score screens for entering your
	initials. Use the keyboard, as the joystick won't work for this
	function.
	
	If you are unable to register online, please make sure to send in your
	registration card.
	
	Our faithful reproduction of these classic games is so complete that
	we purposely included the idiosyncrasies of the originals. For
	example, in Pac-Man, the Customize Game dialog box allows you to set
	the number of lives a player is given for three or five, but there is
	no setting for four lives. This is because such a setting wasn't
	allowed by the DIP switches on the original arcade game. Likewise,
	eating a flashing ghost at just the right moment as it exits the
	starting cage causes the eyes to float around the maze, rather than
	return to the cage.
	
	-------------------------------
	THE BOSS KEY LIVES!
	As with Microsoft Arcade, Microsoft Return of Arcade has the same
	great "boss key" that makes the game disappear should the need arise
	to look busy. Just press the Escape key and your game will be
	immediately paused and minimized -- becoming a mere taskbar button
	along the bottom of your work-filled desktop. A click of the game's
	taskbar button returns you to exactly where you left off.
	
	----------------
	HAVE FUN!
	Dive into the worlds of Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaxian and Pole Position!
	
	It's the Microsoft Return of Arcade!
