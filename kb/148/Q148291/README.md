	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you obtain a list of available voice commands while Listening mode is stopped
	by moving the mouse pointer to the corner of the screen that activates Listening
	mode and then issuing the "What can I say?" command, the list of available voice
	commands that is displayed may be incomplete. This problem can occur when you
	move the mouse pointer shortly after issuing the "What can I say?" command.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you move the mouse pointer away from the corner of the screen that
	activates Listening mode, Listening mode is immediately stopped again. If the
	list of available voice commands has not yet been completely displayed, the
	remainder of the list is not displayed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, do not move the mouse pointer away from the corner
	of the screen until the list of available voice commands has been completely
	displayed.
