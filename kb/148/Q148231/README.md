	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using Windows 95 on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Vectra computer, your
	computer may stop responding (hang) when you click Shut Down The Computer in the
	Shut Down Windows dialog box and then click Yes.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur on some HP Vectra computers with older BIOS chip sets.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, contact Hewlett-Packard Technical Support to obtain the
	appropriate updated BIOS.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	According to Hewlett-Packard Technical Support, the following computers require
	an updated BIOS to work correctly with Windows 95:
	
	- HP Vectra VE-series computers need to be updated to BIOS version GL.05.08 or
	  later.
	
	- HP Vectra VL3 computers need to be updated to BIOS version GK0509 or later.
	
	- HP Vectra XM3 computers need to be updated to BIOS version GK0503 or later.
	
	
	Additional Information
	----------------------
	
	According to Hewlett-Packard, upgrading to Windows 95 with a Microsoft Windows 95
	Upgrade CD-ROM causes a shutdown hang. This could be a problem for users who
	reinstall Windows 95 from a retail Windows 95 Upgrade CD-ROM. To resolve the
	issue, change the mouse driver to the Microsoft Mouse driver.
