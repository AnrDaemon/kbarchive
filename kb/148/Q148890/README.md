	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 ISBN 1-55615-913-7, version 1.0 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Setup for Mastering Access Programming on a computer running
	Windows NT version 3.51, some of the Setup program dialog boxes do not fit in
	the title bar.
	
	A visible example of this behavior occurs when Setup concludes. The "Successfully
	Completed" dialog box title is too big to display in the title bar.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	The behavior is by design and not a programming problem with Mastering Visual
	Basic. This behavior will not affect operation of the program, and does not
	indicate a problem with your system.
