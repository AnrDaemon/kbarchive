	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A computer using Advanced Power Management (APM) features is not suspended when
	an MS-DOS session (or virtual machine) is active.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When no screen saver is selected and the Shut Off Monitor option is enabled, the
	monitor is not shut off when an MS-DOS session is active.

	To work around this behavior, enable a screen saver. To do so, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.
	
	2. Click the Screen Saver tab.
	
	3. Click a screen saver in the Screen Saver box, and then click OK.
