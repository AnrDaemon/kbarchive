	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Microsoft Exchange client to read a mail message, you may see a
	thin black line underneath the From: field in the message header.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. The black line is always present underneath the From: header
	in messages; however, it will be more or less pronounced depending on the color
	scheme you are using and the Readbar color you select.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you do not want to see a black line, you can adjust the Readbar color so that
	the black line no longer appears to be present:
	
	1. On the Tools menu, Click Options.
	
	2. Select the Colors tab.
	
	3. In the Message section, select a different color for the Readbar.
	
	4. Click Apply or OK to use the new color.
