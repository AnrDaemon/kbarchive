## Q148169: HP LaserJet 5Si Printer Property Changes Affect All Programs

	Article: Q148169
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): 95
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you make changes to the properties for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
	5Si or 5Si MX printer driver, including any changes on the Paper, Graphics,
	Fonts, or Device Options tabs, the changes affect all Windows- based programs in
	Windows 95.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The HP LaserJet 5Si and 5Si MX printer drivers version 2.40 use the global
	printer properties user interface in Windows 95 to make changes to the printer
	properties.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, use the HP LaserJet 4Si MX printer driver with HP
	LaserJet 5Si printers. This printer driver provides most, but not all, of the
	functionality in the 5Si and 5Si MX printer drivers.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Hewlett-Packard is aware of this issue. The printer drivers for the HP LaserJet
	5Si printers are available only from Hewlett-Packard's online services.
