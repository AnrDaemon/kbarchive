	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are formatting text in WordPad, you may experience one or more of the
	following problems:
	
	- When you select a section of colored text that contains more than one color
	  and then click Font on the Format menu, the Effects area does not appear in
	  the Font dialog box. The Effects area normally appears in the lower left
	  corner of the Font dialog box and contains the Strikeout and Underline check
	  boxes and the Color box.
	
	- When you click Font on the Format menu, the Automatic selection does not
	  appear in the Color box.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around these problems, use the appropriate method:
	
	- To format a section of colored text that contains more than one color, format
	  smaller sections of text that contain only one color at a time. For example,
	  if you want to format a section of colored text that contains both black and
	  red text, format the black text first, and then format the red text.
	
	- To change the text color to Automatic, select the section of text that you
	  want to change, click the Color button on the toolbar, and then click
	  Automatic.
	
	  NOTE: If you do not see a Color button on the toolbar, you may need to turn on
	  the format bar. To do so, click Options on the View menu, click the Format
	  Bar check box to select it on the Text, Rich Text, Word 6, and Write tabs,
	  and then click OK.
