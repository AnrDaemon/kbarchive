	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	InvDos reports only 16 environment strings on MS-DOS clients. So even if there
	are 17 or more defined on the client, in SMS AdminUI only the first 16 will be
	displayed. This also applies to "set" statements on Windows NT.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2.
