	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Encarta, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  Encarta cannot find the files needed to start.
	
	Reinstalling Encarta does not resolve the issue.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Your computer is not properly reading the Encarta compact disc.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, try the following troubleshooting procedures:
	
	- Inspect and clean the compact disc.
	- Test your CD-ROM drive file access.
	- Change your CD-ROM drive caching settings.
	
	NOTE: After completing each procedure, try starting Encarta. If the error still
	occurs, continue with the remaining troubleshooting procedures.
	
	Inspecting and Cleaning the Compact Disc
	----------------------------------------
	
	To verify that the compact disc is clean and free of scratches, inspect the
	silver side of the disc. To clean the disc, wipe it with a soft cloth in a
	straight line, starting from the center of the disc and working your way out to
	the edge. Light or fine scratches should not create problems reading the compact
	disc.
	
	Test Your CD-ROM Drive File Access Capability
	---------------------------------------------
	
	If there is no apparent physical damage, and the error message still occurs after
	you clean the compact disc, the CD-ROM disc caching may be improperly configured
	for your computer, or your CD-ROM drive may be unable to properly read
	high-density 680 MB compact discs.
	
	Some CD-ROM discs are low density (540 MB maximum) and some are high density (680
	MB maximum).
	
	For information about how to perform a file access test for a particular
	Microsoft multimedia compact disc, please query on the following keywords in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  <program> cdr101
	
	where <program> is the name of the multimedia program you are using.
	
	For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q148351 Multimedia: Some CD-ROM Drives Can't Properly Read Disc
	
	If your drive is not designed to reliably read 680 MB compact discs, you must
	purchase a new MPC-compatible CD-ROM drive.
	
	If your drive specification supports 680 MB compact disc and the file access test
	fails, you should contact your hardware vendor for further troubleshooting and
	product information.
	
	Changing CD-ROM Drive Caching Settings
	--------------------------------------
	
	If you are using SmartDrive, disable CD-ROM caching.
	
	If you are using Microsoft Windows 95/98, set the caching to "No Read-Ahead."
	
	For detailed information about how to perform these steps for both Windows 95/98
	and MS-DOS, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
