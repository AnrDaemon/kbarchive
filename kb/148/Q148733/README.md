	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click Help in the Qfecheck.exe tool installed with Microsoft Windows 95

	  Cannot find the QFECHECK.HLP file.
	
	  Do you want to try to find this file yourself?
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this situation, copy the Qfecheck.hlp file from the Admin\
	Components\Updates\Netsetup folder on the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 CD-ROM to
	the Windows\Help folder on your hard disk. Or, if you installed Windows 95
	Service Pack 1 from floppy disks, copy the Qfecheck.hlp from the folder listed
	above on your hard disk to the Windows\Help folder on your hard disk.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Note that this behavior does not occur if you install the full version of
	Windows 95 Service Pack 1. It occurs only if you install the Microsoft Exchange
	Update component separately.
