	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you download an Internet Update file on a computer system running
	Microsoft Windows version 3.x, and double-click the Bs96ingn.z96 update file,
	Bookshelf runs without updating the Internet Directory.
	
	The Bs96ingn.z96 update file is not deleted from your system.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The Internet Updates file Bs96ingn.z96 must reside on the same drive where
	Bookshelf is installed. Before you try to double-click the update file, make
	sure you copy, or download, the file to the hard drive where you installed
	Bookshelf.
	
	For example, if Bookshelf is installed on the C:\ drive, the Bs96ingn.z96 file
	must be copied to C:\ before you can perform a successful integration. After the
	integration occurs the Bs96ingn.z96 Update file is deleted from the computer.
