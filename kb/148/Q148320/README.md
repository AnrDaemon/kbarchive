	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you print a message from a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows and notice
	that the printed copy is missing letters on the right side of the page, you
	might need to set the Print TrueType as Graphics option. This can by done by
	clicking the File menu, clicking Print, clicking the Properties button, clicking
	the Fonts tab, and selecting the Print TrueType as Graphics button.
	
	This is also explained in the Readme.wri file located on the Microsoft Exchange
	Client Software CD.
