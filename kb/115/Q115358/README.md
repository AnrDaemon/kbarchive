	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Versions 2.1 and 3.0 of the X.400 gateway allow you to enter ASCII values in the
	TSAP and SSAP fields, but not hexadecimal values, which were also required. Hex
	values have to be entered in the form $xx$xx, in order to be compatible with
	other hex fields, but this required more room than was available in the TSAP and
	SSAP fields.
