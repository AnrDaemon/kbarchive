	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After starting X400ADM.EXE, when you select Customized Mapping (with the mouse
	or Alt-C) the text screen (from the bottom of the X.400 Gateway Administrator
	window and up) scrolls up, resulting in the window's title bar scrolling off the
	screen leaving a black line that represents the bottom of the original window.
	
	This occurs only when you open the Customized Mapping window for the first time,
	and appears to be noticeable only on 386 or slower machines. Although
	distracting, it introduces no errors or problems. The screen is repainted
	correctly.
