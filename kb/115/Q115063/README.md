	- Microsoft Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Printed output from Dinosaurs (for example, a fact box) may have a lower
	resolution than expected, even with print quality set to high.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	All text and pictures in Dinosaurs are 96 DPI (dots per inch) bitmaps and are
	designed to be viewed best on the screen. The fonts are anti-aliased for a
	"smoother" on-screen look. When the text and pictures are printed at any DPI
	resolution, the quality will not improve beyond 96 DPI. This is a design
	restriction of bitmapped text. Images are always printed in the resolution they
	display.
