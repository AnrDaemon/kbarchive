	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Use an editor to search the Config utility's Customized Mapping for a particular
	user who is already mapped.
	
	If you have entered a large number of address maps and need to go directly to one
	of them, it is neither quick nor efficient to use the utility and scroll to the
	user you want. Using an editor makes the task much easier.
