	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your Maynard Maynstream 1350Q tape drive fails to backup and restore
	successfully under Windows NT version 3.1. The tape drive continuously rewinds.
	The drive status is constantly busy.

	=====
	
	Your Maynard tape drive has a firmware revision prior to version 6.0 (28077-
	003). Although your tape drive appears on the Windows NT 3.1 hardware
	compatibility list (HCL), only version 6.0 of the firmware was tested.
