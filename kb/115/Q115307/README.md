	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual C++ 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The App Studio User's Guide for Visual C++, versions 1.0 (16- and 32-bit
	editions) and 1.5, specifies that to extend the number of icon types
	handled by the App Studio, an entry is required in APSTUDIO.INI of
	[IconDevices]. This last term is incorrect and should read "[Icon Devices]"
	(two words). Similarly, "[CursorDevices]" should read "[Cursor Devices]".
	
	For the App Studio User's Guide for Visual C++, version 1.0 (16- and 32-bit
	editions), the errors are listed on pages 102-103 and in the App Studio
	User's Guide for Visual C++, version 1.5, they are listed on page 99.
