	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Home CD Sampler Spring 1994 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you choose a demonstration button in the Home CD Sampler and then move the
	pointer away from the button and back onto it again, the button will not depress
	a second time. However, if you release the mouse button while the pointer is
	positioned over the demonstration button, the demonstration will start, as
	expected.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Click a demonstration button in the Home CD Sampler and hold the mouse button
	  down.
	
	  The button depresses (if it is a product-box button, it also becomes
	  highlighted).
	
	2. Move the mouse pointer away from the demonstration button.
	
	  The button returns to its normal position. The highlight also disappears.
	
	  NOTE: If at this point you released the mouse button, the demonstration would
	  not start.
	
	3. Move the mouse pointer back onto the demonstration button.
	
	The button does not depress when you move the pointer back onto it. However, even
	though the demonstration button does not depress, the demonstration will start
	if you release the mouse button now.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Home CD Sampler, Spring 1994. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
