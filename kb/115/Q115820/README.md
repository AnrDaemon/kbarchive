	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	During the Money overview demonstration in the Microsoft Home CD Sampler, the
	narration stalls after the words "quickly and at your convenience." It resumes
	again after a long pause.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Home CD Sampler, Spring
	1994. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
