	=======
	
	PowerPoint is designed to allow you to draw on the screen during an on-screen
	presentation. The line color of the drawings cannot be changed.
	
	The line color is determined by the background color of the slide you are on. For
	the lighter backgrounds, the line color is green. For the darker backgrounds,
	the line color is yellow.
