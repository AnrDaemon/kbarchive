	- Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1994 edition, 1995 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	QuickShelf may not work as expected if you are running Microsoft Windows NT. For
	example, if you highlight a word in Notepad and then click a button on the
	QuickShelf toolbar, Bookshelf will open, but the highlighted word will not
	appear in an edit field, nor will Bookshelf perform a search on the highlighted
	word.
	
	NOTE: This functionality may work correctly with some word processing
	applications and not with others. For example, it has been found to work
	correctly with Write but not with Notepad.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf, editions
	listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in
	Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 and Microsoft Bookshelf 96-97 for
	Windows.
