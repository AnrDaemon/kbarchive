	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Quarterdeck Qemm 7.03 READ.ME file states the following:
	
	  If you are using QEMM's Stealth DoubleSpace feature and you decide to switch
	  back to MS-DOS 6's memory manager, the ST-DBL.SYS driver will perform the
	  same function as DOS's DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE. That is, it will allow
	  DBLSPACE.BIN to be moved into upper memory. You can replace ST-DBL.SYS with
	  DBLSPACE.SYS, but you will suffer no ill effects if you do not.
	
	Although this is true, you do sacrifice approximately 12 kilobytes of
	conventional memory readme
