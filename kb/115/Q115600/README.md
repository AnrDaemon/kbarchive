	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The following floppy disk problems may occur when you are running Windows 95:
	
	- You cannot access your floppy disk drive.
	
	- When you choose a floppy disk drive, it attempts to read the wrong drive.
	
	- Your floppy disk drive does not appear or appears incorrectly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If the CMOS settings of your computer do not indicate that a floppy disk drive
	is installed, Windows 95 may not be able to display your floppy disk information
	correctly. MS-DOS, or the real-mode portion of Windows 95, may allow you to
	access the floppy disk drive.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Refer to your computer documentation, or consult with your hardware vendor
	regarding how to access and update your CMOS settings.
