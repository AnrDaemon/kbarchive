	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Version 3.0 of the X.400 gateway can handle recipient lists of about 50
	recipients only. This limit was imposed by the fact that message headers are
	built into memory, and that mechanism could not easily be changed.
	
	X400GATE 3.2 handles 200 recipients of size 100 bytes each (and 1K text) which is
	pproximately 25% more than version 3.0.
	
	
	Additional query words: 3.20
