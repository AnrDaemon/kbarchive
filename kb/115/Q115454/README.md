	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The routing table written by the Config utility is not indented.
	
	This may or may not strike you as important, but it might if you spend time
	manually typing in a routing table, then find that Config removes any
	indentation you inserted, even when you use Config to make only a small update.
	
	Use X400ADM.EXE to work with the ROUTE.CFG file. The Admin utility prints the
	file with indentations and was designed as the tool for this type of job.
