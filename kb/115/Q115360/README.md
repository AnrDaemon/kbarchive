## Q115360: X400: Cursor Stays in First Column of Route Table

	Article: Q115360

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The cursor "sticks" in the first column of the Route table: text is displayed
	after the = sign, but the cursor remains at the beginning of the line as you
	type in data. It does not, as it should, appear at the end of the line ready for
	input, then move with each keystroke.
	
	The END key does not, as it should, move the cursor to the end of the line.
	
	This does not indicate a problem; it simply is the way the cursor behaves in this
	screen.
	
	STEPS TO REPRODUCE BEHAVIOR
	---------------------------
	
	1. Start X400ADM.EXE
	
	2. Select Routing button
	
	3. Use mouse to point to a line in the Route table
	
	4. Select a button from the X.400 Address Attributes
	
	5. Type some text.
