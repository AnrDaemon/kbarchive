	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server service is stopped
	and restarted, Tcpsvcs.exe may stop responding (hang), and you may receive a Dr.
	Watson error message.

	This problem can be caused by a heap corruption problem with the DHCP service.
	The heap corruption only occurs when the DHCP service is stopped and then
	immediately restarted.
