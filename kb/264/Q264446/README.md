	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you upgrade from Exchange Server 5.5, the default installation folder is
	not changed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior can be confusing because the default installation folder for a new
	installation of Exchange 2000 Server is %SystemRoot%\Program Files\Exchsrvr. If
	you installed Exchange Server 5.5 to %SystemRoot%\Exchsrvr, after you upgrade to
	Exchange 2000, the installation folder is not changed.
