	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Exchange Server 5.5, there is no option in the Microsoft Exchange Server
	Administrator program (Admin.exe) to automate a bulk move mailbox process.
	
	There is also no command-line option or non-graphical user interface (GUI) method
	in the Administrator program that currently provides this capability.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior is by product design. The administrator must start the
	Administrator program and manually select the group of mailboxes that the
	administrator wants to move on each server.
	
	Additional query words: Multiple Moveuser
