	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to individually control engines when you use a
	multiple engine aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Flight Simulator 2000, you control all of the engines on an aircraft by
	default. If you want to control a particular engine, you can give that engine
	the control or focus by pressing the following key combination
	
	  E+x
	
	where x is a number (1 through 4) that indicates the engine that you want to
	control.
	
	If you set the focus to control one engine and you want to control more than one
	engine, press and hold down the E key while you press the number key for each
	engine that you want to control.
	
	For example, if you want to control both engines on a two-engine aircraft, press
	the following key combination:
	
	  E+1,2
	
	NOTE: If you are experiencing engine related issues in Flight Simulator 2000,
	download and install the Flight Simulator 2000 Update from the following
	Microsoft Web site:
