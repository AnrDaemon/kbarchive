	Article: Q264076
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Using FOR /F in a batch command file may cause an access violation in Cmd.exe.
	This behavior can occur when you use a statement similar to the following sample
	statement if the file has been passed as parameter %1 and contains a single line
	with more than 256 characters:
	
	  for /f "tokens=2,3,5,8,10 delims=," %%i in (%1) do if %%k==10 call :loop %%i
	  %%j %%l "%%m"
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because Cmd.exe corrupts the heap while it is reading the
	token file.
