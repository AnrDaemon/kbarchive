	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you fly the Concorde aircraft at low altitudes in Microsoft Flight
	Simulator 2000, the scenery may appear to shudder violently if you look out of
	the side windows.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when you fly the Concorde at an unsafe speed.
	
	The program is simulating the motion of the aircraft that would actually occur in
	this situation.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent this issue from occurring, do not exceed the maximum safe speed when
	you fly the Concorde at low altitudes.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	On the airspeed indicator instrument, an orange and black needle that is known
	as the "barber pole" shows the maximum safe speed for the airplane at its
	current altitude.
	
	If you exceed the maximum safe speed for your altitude, an "overspeed" text
	warning is displayed on the screen, and the scenery begins to shudder as is
	described in the "Symptoms" section of this article.
	
	The maximum safe speed, or Velocity Maximum Operation (VMO) for the Concorde
	starts at 270 knots at sea level, and steadily increases to 400 knots at about
	4,500 feet. The VMO remains at 400 knots until you rise above 32,000 feet, at
	which point it begins to increase again.
	
	Although you can fly the Concorde at speeds of up to Mach 2, you can only do this
	at extremely high altitudes. In reality, the aircraft would break up long before
	you reached a speed of Mach 1 at any altitude below 5,000 feet.
