	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Uncoordinated Flight
	lesson (under Option W, "See more lessons") in Flight Instruction mode, upon
	landing the aircraft, the instructor says, "left rudder to align, right aileron
	for wind." However, the aileron indicator is to the left as if you were in
	coordinated flight.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
