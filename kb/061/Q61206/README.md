	PWB Build Procedure
	-------------------
	
	When developing programs with PWB, you usually follow these basic
	steps:
	
	- Edit your source file or files.
	
	- Use the Build Options command on the Options menu to set initial
	  build options.
	
	- Use the Compiler Options and Link Options commands to adjust
	  specific parameters.
	
	- If you are building a multimodule program, use Set Program List on
	  the Make menu to specify the files that will be included in the
	  program.
	
	- Choose Build or Rebuild All from the Make menu to build your
	  program.
	
	For more information, choose "Building and Running Programs" from the
	Programmer's WorkBench contents screen in online help.
