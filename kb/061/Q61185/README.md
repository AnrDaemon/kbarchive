	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Loop lesson (under Option
	W, "See more lessons") in Flight Instruction mode, when the plane is at the top
	of the loop, the rear view shows the road, which jumps around and disorients the
	pilot. Ideally, the rear view should be removed and the scenery should consist
	of small rectangles that remain a bit longer on the side views.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
