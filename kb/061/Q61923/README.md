	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To add a new logbook entry in Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, the plane
	must be flying for 6 to 10 minutes before Flight Simulator will allow you to
	enter a logbook entry. If the simulator has not been running long enough, the
	logbook can be viewed but no entries or edits can be made.
