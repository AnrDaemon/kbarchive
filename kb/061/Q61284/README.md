	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following information pertains to the HyperCard Form Designer for Microsoft
	Mail:
	
	To have information (such as text within a field, check boxes, or radio buttons)
	transfer from the Read screen to the Send screen, the names of the fields must
	be the same. Please note that the Form Designer IS case sensitive.
	
	For example, to have the Send screen check box "Rabbit Owner" transfer to the
	Read screen, name the check box "Rabbit Owner" on the Read screen. This ensures
	that if someone using the form checks the box, it will be reflected on the Read
	screen.
	
	The above information applies to editable text fields, radio buttons, and check
	boxes.
