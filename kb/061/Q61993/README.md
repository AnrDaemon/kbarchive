	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When running Flight Simulator with an EGA monochrome monitor and an EGA graphics
	card, the screen may appear dim and be difficult to see.
	
	To solve this problem, select the VGA option when starting Flight Simulator. The
	VGA option allows Flight Simulator to use a different color palette than with
	the EGA option and produces a better display on an EGA monochrome monitor.
