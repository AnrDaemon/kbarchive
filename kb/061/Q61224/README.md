	Graphics and Dual-Monitor Debugging Require New Mouse Driver
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
	- When debugging a graphics program or using two-monitor debugging,
	  make sure you have the most current version (7.00) of the Microsoft
	  Mouse driver installed. If you do not have the most current version,
	  or are using a mouse from another manufacturer, you should use the
	  /M option (disable mouse support) in the situations referred to
	  above.
