	- Microsoft Windows versions 1.1, 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	With certain Hayes-compatible modems (for example, Practical Peripherals),
	Microsoft Terminal connects but is unable to communicate. If Terminal does
	not release the communication port when you try to close Terminal, the
	following error message occurs:
	
	  Cannot Communicate with Modem
	
	This prevents other communication packages (for example, DynaComm or
	CrossTalk) from connecting.
	
	To end the connection, it must be physically broken. You should physically
	disconnect the phone and then reconnect.
