	PWB: Use %s, Not %S, for Run.Customize Argument
	-----------------------------------------------
	
	The online help for the Customize Menu option on the Run Menu is
	partially incorrect. It says that when you are adding a command to the
	Run menu you can specify %S in the Argument box to get the name of the
	current file. However, to specify the current file as an argument, you
	must use %s (lowercase s).
