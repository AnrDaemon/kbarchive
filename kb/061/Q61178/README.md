	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Straight and Level lesson
	in Flight Instruction mode, the gear is down under instruction control and
	student control. Ideally, the gear should be up for straight and level flight.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
