	Use /Gh Option to Build Windows 2.x Applications
	------------------------------------------------
	
	The /Gh option allows building with Microsoft Windows 2.x libraries.
	This option is not needed for versions of Windows later than 2.x. In
	addition, this feature exists only in C 6.00, and will be phased out
	in future versions of the compiler.
