	The error "EMS Corrupt" occurs when running QBX.EXE with 386MAX using
	the "noframe" option for 386MAX. This option causes 386MAX to not use
	any page frames in base memory. QBX.EXE does not support this method
	of expanded memory management.
	
	This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
	System (PDS) version 7.00.
