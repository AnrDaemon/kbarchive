	LINK/LIB/NMAKE/BIND: OS/2 1.20 Long Filename Restrictions
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	- LINK, LIB, NMAKE, and BIND have two restrictions with regard to
	  support of OS/2 1.20 long filenames:
	
	1. Quoted filenames can be used only once per argument. You can get
	   around this limitation by using a response file.
	
	2. If quotes are necessary, the full filename (including the path)
	   must be enclosed in quotation marks.
