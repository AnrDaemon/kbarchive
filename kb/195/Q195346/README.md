	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you press CTRL+SHIFT+I to open the About dialog box, the System Info button
	may not be visible in the lower-right corner of the dialog box.
	
	If this button is not visible, you are unable to use Microsoft System Information
	to view information about your system.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if your Microsoft Windows display scheme uses a large or
	extra large font.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, change your Windows display scheme to one that does
	not use a large or extra large font. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Display.
	
	3. Click the Appearance tab.
	
	4. In the Scheme box, click a scheme that does not use a large or extra large
	  font, and then click OK.
	
	5. Close Control Panel.
	
	NOTE: You can repeat these steps at any time to restore your original Windows
	display scheme.
