	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to view a My Personal Tutor 1st & 2nd grade program using
	multiple monitors in Microsoft Windows 98, you may encounter any of the
	following symptoms:
	
	- My Personal Tutor programs may be minimized when you click another program's
	  window.
	
	- Large black areas may appear on the screen after you maximize a My Personal
	  Tutor program.
	
	- When you click a My Personal Tutor program on the taskbar, the program may
	  not be maximized, and the taskbar may no longer be visible.
	
	- When you start a My Personal Tutor program, other programs running on the
	  computer may no longer be visible or may only be partially visible on the
	  screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because the My Personal Tutor 1st & 2nd grade
	programs are designed to run in full screen mode and, as a result, cannot be
	viewed properly using multiple monitors.
