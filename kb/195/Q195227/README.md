	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) includes Security Configuration Manager
	(SCM) as an optional component. SCM is an integrated security system that gives
	administrators the ability to define and apply security configurations for
	Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server installations. SCM also has the
	capability to perform inspections of the installed systems to locate any
	degradation in the system's security. For further information on SCM, including
	installation and usage instructions, refer to the Readme.txt file in the Mssce
	folder on your Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 CD-ROM.
	
	NOTE: The Readme.txt file refers to the Security Configuration Manager as the
	Security Configuration Editor. These names are interchangeable.
