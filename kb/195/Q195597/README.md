	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word, if you press CTRL+SHIFT+F8 to select a column of text and
	then apply character formatting, the text does not remain selected after you
	apply the formatting.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you press CTRL+SHIFT+F8, the Column Selection mode is activated, and you
	can use the arrow keys to select a column of text. If you apply character
	formatting to the selected text, the width of the characters changes. This can
	cause the column selection to no longer be accurate. Therefore, the text
	selection is lost when character formatting is applied.
	
	NOTE: You can also perform a column selection by holding the ALT key while
	clicking and dragging with the left mouse button.
