	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to create a hanging indent (often described as an "F4
	indent" or "F7 indent" by WordPerfect users). A hanging indent is a paragraph
	that has a little text at the left, and the rest of the paragraph is indented,
	as in the following example:
	
	1. <TAB>  text text text text text text text text text text text text
	          text text text text text text text text text text
	
	Education: <TAB> text text text text text text text text text text text
	                 text text text text text text text text text text text
	                 text text
	
	In Microsoft Word 97, Help for WordPerfect Users indicates that you cannot indent
	a single line of a paragraph in Microsoft Word, and that a hanging indent is
	created by pressing CTRL+M. This is incorrect.
	
	Actually, you can create a hanging indent by pressing CTRL+T.

	================
	
	Apply This Formatting Now
	-------------------------
	
	If you have already applied paragraph formatting to your text, remove it by
	selecting the paragraphs and pressing CTRL+Q. Then use any of the following
	methods:
	
	- If you want numbers to appear at the left of your text, use the automatic
	  numbering feature in Word. Select the text and click the Numbering button on
	  the Formatting toolbar. If you already had numbers applied to some or all of
	  your text, Word may remove them. Click the Numbering button again to make the
	  numbers come back.
	
	- If you want bullets to appear at the beginning of each paragraph, use the
	  same method as above, but click the Bullets button instead.
	
	- If you have different text that you want to use along the left margin, select
	  all the paragraphs, and press CTRL+T. Then press the TAB key after the
	  left-most text at the beginning of each line. This method is described in
	  greater detail below.
	
	Customizing a Hanging Indent
	----------------------------
	
	If the default settings are not in the right place for your document, you can
	customize where the bulk of the text lines up. You can do this with the mouse
	and the ruler, or with the Format menus.
	
	With the Mouse and Ruler:
	
	1. In a sample paragraph, press CTRL+Q.
	
	2. Move the mouse to the ruler. Drag the bottom triangle and square to where you
	  want the text to line up.
	
	3. Between the text at the left and the rest of the paragraph, press the TAB
	  key.
	
	With the Format Menus:
	
	1. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.
	
	2. Select the Indents and Spacing tab.
	
	3. In the Special box (under Indentation), click Hanging. In the By box, type
	  the amount you want the text to move from the left margin and then click OK.
	
	4. Move the insertion point between the text on the left, and press the TAB key.
	
	Tips
	----
	
	- If the paragraph already has custom tabs, when you press CTRL+T, the second
	  and subsequent lines move to the first tab stop.
	
	- If you indent too many times and want to go back one tab stop, press
	  CTRL+SHIFT+T.
	
	Formatting Methods to Avoid
	---------------------------
	
	- Do not use spaces to line up text. Using multiple spaces causes text to wrap
	  at odd points.
	
	- If you have more than one line of text that you want to appear at the left,
	  do not use a hanging indent. A hanging indent only allows one line to appear
	  by itself on the left. A table is better suited for this task; to create a
	  table, click Insert Table on the Table menu.
	
	Example of a Table:
	
	  Educational         text text text text text text text text text text
	  Background          text text text text text text text text text text
	                      text text text text text text
