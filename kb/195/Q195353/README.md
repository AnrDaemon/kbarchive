	The ActiveX controls listed above are no longer supported, but ship with the
	Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for backward
	compatibility when upgrading existing projects.
	
	These controls do not ship with the Learning Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic.
	
	For the Professional and Enterprise Editions, the controls are located on the
	installation CDs at the following locations:
	
	Microsoft Visual Basic Edition        Location
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Professional 6.0                      \Common\Tools\VB\Controls
	Enterprise 6.0                        \Common\Tools\VB\Controls
	Visual Studio Professional 6.0        \Common\Tools\VB\Controls (CD2)
	Visual Studio Enterprise 6.0          \Common\Tools\VB\Controls (CD3)
	
	
	Each of these directories contain a README.TXT with instructions on how to
	install the controls for design-time use.
	
	NOTE: Using the Learning Edition to upgrade a project developed in an earlier
	version of Microsoft Visual Basic might result in licensing problems for these
	controls.
	
	The VBUSC.EXE installs the design-time licenses for the controls listed above if
	Visual Basic is detected on the computer.
