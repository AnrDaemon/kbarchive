## Q195129: WD97: WordPerfect Table Formulas Are Not Retained in Word

	Article: Q195129
	Product(s): Word 97 for Windows

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Word 97, when you open a WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS or WordPerfect
	5.1 or 5.2 for Windows document containing tables with formulas (table math),
	only the latest recalculated results of the formulas are retained as normal
	text. The formulas themselves are lost.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a current design limitation of the WordPerfect converters supplied with
	the Word family of products.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Word for Windows does support performing calculations within table cells. To
	restore mathematical relationships among table cells, re-enter the formulas
	after the conversion is complete.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	WordPerfect's Table Math option allows you to define math formulas that add,
	subtract, multiply, and divide the values you put into referenced cells in much
	the same way you can in Word.
	
	WordPerfect's Table Formulas are separate from WordPerfect Equations, which Word
	versions 2.0b and later do retain during conversion.
