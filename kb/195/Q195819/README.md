	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The SNA Print Service does not preserve Spool File Attributes (like characters
	per line and lines per inch) from one print job to the next for AS/400 print
	sessions that are not using Host Print Transform.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server Versions 3.0, 3.0
	SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1. We are researching this problem in SNA
	Server version 3.0 and will post more information here in the Knowledge Base as
	it becomes available.
	
	This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
	Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
	word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If an AS/400 sends SCS control codes that set the Spool File attributes for a
	print job, it will not send the SCS control codes for the next print job if they
	have the same Spool File attributes.
