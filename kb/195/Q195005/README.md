	automatically populated.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To view the document properties, click Properties on the File menu.
	
	When the document is saved, the Title, by default, is populated with the first
	line of text from the document.
	
	The Author, by default, is populated with the name that appears in the User
	Information tab (on the Tools menu, click Options).
	
	The Company, by default, is populated by the company name that was used when Word
	97 was installed.
	
	To work around these default settings, follow these steps:
	
	All Document Properties
	-----------------------
	
	To make sure that all document properties are saved with the properties that you
	need, on the File menu, click Options. Click the Save tab and select the "Prompt
	for document properties" option. When you save the document, you can change the
	Title, Author, or Company to the settings you want for that particular
	document.
	
	Title Property
	--------------
	
	You can set the default Title for the Normal template or any template you are
	using by opening the template and changing the Title under File Properties to
	reflect the title you want when a document is saved.
	
	To modify the template, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the File menu, click Open.
	
	2. In the Files Of Type list, click Document Templates.
	
	3. Go to the User Template directory or to the directory where the Normal.dot
	  file is located. The default location is:
	
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates
	
	4. Click the Normal.dot icon, and then click Open.
	
	5. On the File menu, click Properties.
	
	6. In the Title field, type the title that you want or type spaces for a blank
	  title.
	
	7. Save and close the template.
	
	Author Property
	---------------
	
	You can set the default Author by changing the name in the User Information tab.
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Options.
	
	2. Click the User Information tab.
	
	3. Change the name to the author name you want.
	
	NOTE: You can place spaces in the Name field to have the name blank when the
	document is saved.
