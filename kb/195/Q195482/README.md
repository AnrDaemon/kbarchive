	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to select a portion of text within a form field and that form
	field is in a table cell or a frame, you get one of the following results:
	
	- The entire form field is selected.
	
	  -or-
	
	- The text is selected from the insertion point to the left or right end of the
	  form field.
	
	In contrast, when you select a portion of text within a form field that is placed
	outside of a table, you can select individual characters.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To delete characters, position the insertion point before or after the text you
	want to delete, and then press either the DELETE key or the BACKSPACE key,
	respectively.
	
	To type over existing characters, enable Overtype mode. To do this, double-click
	the OVR indicator in the status bar.
