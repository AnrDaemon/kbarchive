	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view a disputed area such as the Falkland Islands or the Western Sahara
	in Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99, the word "Disputed" appears twice inside
	the Dynamic Sensor tool, as in the following example:
	
	  Falkland Islands (disputed) (Disputed)
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur because the Dynamic Sensor tool is designed to append
	the text (Disputed) to the name of a disputed area when you move the pointer
	over the disputed area.
	
	Because the text (disputed) is also appended to the name of a disputed area on
	the map to avoid the appearance of taking sides in a territorial conflict, the
	word "Disputed" is repeated inside the Dynamic Sensor tool when you move the
	pointer over a disputed area.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe
	99, version 1.0.
