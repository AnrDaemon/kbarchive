	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use a Cisco cable modem, you may not be able to receive an Internet
	Protocol (IP) address from a Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer using Dynamic
	Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). The server generates an "error 10040" error
	message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the cable modem client sends a packet larger than
	the maximum length of the DHCP packet as defined in the RFC (576 bytes).
