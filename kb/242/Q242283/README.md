	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A 16-bit Windows-on-Windows (WOW) subsystem may stop responding (hang) when you
	are running multiple Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) programs.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if a 16-bit Windows-based program using DDE is
	terminated while a second 16-bit Windows-based program is enumerating the active
	DDE program list. This causes the second program to hang, stopping the whole WOW
	subsystem.
