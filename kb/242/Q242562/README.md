	Exchange Server Resource Guide
	
	Page 83: Delete Third Bulleted Item
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 83 in the section titled "Moving Exchange to Another Computer," three
	possible scenarios are given. Procedures A and B are described in the subsequent
	pages of this section, but discussion of Procedure C, the third bulleted item,
	is missing from these pages.
	
	Delete the third bulleted item, which references Procedure C.
	
	
	Exchange Server Resource Guide
	
	Pages 155 & 157: Mailbox Cleanup Agent Is Not In This Release
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Pages 155 and 157 refer to the Mailbox Cleanup Agent. This tool is not included
	in this release of the Resource Kit.
	
	
	Systems Management Server 2.0 Resource Guide
	
	Page 140: Incorrect Table Heading In Table 7.2

	Page 98: Corrections To Graphic
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	The items in the page 98 graphic are:
	
	- msdb (Scheduling alerts and jobs)
	
	- master (SQL Server Data Dictionary)
	
	- msdb (Template for all database created)
	
	- tempdb
	
	- DBI (User Database)
	
	The third item should be labeled "model" rather than "msdb". This item also
	contains the word "database", which should be changed to "databases".

	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
