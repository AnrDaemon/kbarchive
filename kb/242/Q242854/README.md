	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains a copy of the Microsoft Certificate Server 1.0 Readme.htm
	file included with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Certificate Server is a standards-based, highly customizable server program for
	managing the creation, issuance, and renewal of digital certificates.
	Certificate Server generates certificates in standard X.509 format. These
	certificates are used for a number of public-key security and authentication
	applications including, but not limited to, server and client authentication
	under the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and Secure/Multipurpose Internet
	Mail (S/MIME).
	
	This update to Certificate Server includes:
	
	- Teletex Encoding - Data encoded as teletex in a certificate request is
	  encoded as teletex data in the certificate issued. Previously, this data was
	  encoded as Unicode in the certificate issued.
	
	- Serial Number - Serial numbers are generated according to X.509 standards.
	  These serial numbers are automatically generated, unique, and always
	  positive. This accommodates restrictive mail clients.
	
	- Backup/Restore - Specific backup requests are supported, including backing up
	  keys and certificates.
	
	- An update to the default policy module so that mail certificates issued are
	  usable by Microsoft Outlook 98.
	
	- An update to fix a problem with certificates issued on February 29th of a
	  leap year. Previously, the validity period had the NotBefore and NotAfter
	  dates set to the same date. With this update, NotBefore and NotAfter are now
	  set correctly in the context of the CA validity for certificates issued on
	  February 29th of a leap year.
	
	- An update to the Certificate Server policy module to correctly process
	  subordinate Certificate Authority (CA) requests.
	
	- An update to the Certificate Server core engine to correctly process the
	  Certificate Server CA chain stored in the local machine certificate store.
	
	- An update to the certificate hierarchy installation tool (Certhier.exe) used
	  during subordinate CA Setup to support both base64 and DER encoded
	  certificates as import file formats.
	
	- An update to the certificate hierarchy installation tool (Certhier.exe) used
	  during subordinate CA Setup to support a broader range of CA certificates
	  encoding types that are generated by other CA when issuing subordinate CA
	  certificates.
	
	- An addition to the Advanced Configuration Options to support the selection of
	  the CA's key size of 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096 bits in length during
	  installation.
	
	Basic Installation of Certificate Server
	----------------------------------------
	
	The following section describes how to install a Certificate Server as a root CA
	with the standard configuration options.
	
	
	To install Certificate Server as a root CA, use the following steps:
	
	NOTE: Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 and Microsoft Internet Explorer
	4.01 or later must be installed on the computer. Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a
	must have been previously applied to the computer.
	
	1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack.
	
	2. Click Next.
	
	3. Click Add/Remove.
	
	4. In the Components box, click Certificate Server.
	
	5. Click Next.
	
	6. In the Microsoft Certificate Server Setup dialog box, type the fully
	  qualified path name of a folder into which configuration information is
	  placed (for example, "c:\public" (without the quotation marks)). If the
	  folder does not exist, it is created. If it is an existing folder, you can
	  click Browse to find the folder name.
	
	7. Click Next. A dialog box is displayed and you are prompted to input
	  identifying information for the CA. Provide the information for each of the
	  requested identifying items.

	8. Click Next. A dialog box is displayed and you are prompted for the location
	  of the Certsrv.cab file. The Certsrv.cab file you need is located on the SP6a
	  CD-ROM, which is located in the Valueadd\Certsrv\Processer folder. Either
	  browse or type the location of the folder containing the .cab file (for
	  example, if the CD-ROM drive is drive E and you have an Intel processor, the
	  location is E:\Valueadd\Certsrv\I386).
	
	9. Click OK.
	
	10. Click Finish.
	
	Known Problems and Limitations
	------------------------------
	
	- Be sure to consult the QFE update release at the following Microsoft Web
	  site:
	
	  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/iis/iis-public/fixes/usa/certserv/
	
	- If you install Certificate Server from the SP6a CD-ROM without first applying
	  SP6a, you may receive a "Msrevoke.dll is missing from the installation
	  directory" error message because Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack is using a Setup
	  file that is incompatible with the new Certificate Server. If you receive the
	  error message, click Cancel, stop the installation process, and apply SP6a
	  before reattempting the installation. SP6a updates the Setup files needed to
	  perform the new installation.
	
	- If you are unable to gain access to the Certificate Server log and queue from
	  the administration Web pages because of an "E78 database access" error
	  message after you install Certificate Server, there may be a problem with the
	  IIS virtual directory settings. To resolve this problem, reapply SP6a after
	  you install Certificate Server or make sure that the application attribute
	  for the Certificate Administration (CertAdm) folder in the default Web site
	  is applied. For additional information about how to apply the application
	  attribute for the CertAdm folder in IIS, click the article number below to
	  view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q241061 Cannot Gain Access to Certificate Server Log and Queue
	
	- If the CA service does not start after you install Certificate Server, check
	  to see if the following error message is displayed in the application log in
	  Event Viewer:
	
	  Event ID: 17
	  Source: CertSvc
	  Description: The Certificate Server did not start: Unable to initialize the
	  database connection for <Your CA Name>. The error code is 0xffffffff.
	
	If this error message is displayed, you may not have the proper SystemDSN
	available for Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). For additional information
	about how to create the proper SystemDSN, click the article number below to view
	the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
