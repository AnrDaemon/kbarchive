	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, the screen colors may flicker
	briefly when you change from one game screen to another.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:
	
	- A third-party program is interfering with Age of Empires II.
	
	- An older video adapter is installed in your computer.
	
	  NOTE: This is a limitation of some older video cards and does not affect game
	  performance or stability.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method.
	
	Third-Party Programs

	II. To do this:
	
	1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.
	
	2. Quit all programs except Explorer and Systray (which are components of
	  Microsoft Windows). To quit a program, click the program, and then click End
	  Task.
	
	3. Repeat steps 1-2 until you have quit all unnecessary programs that are
	  running on your computer.
