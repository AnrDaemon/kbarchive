	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	At the application level (Outlook), you can require a password each time the you
	start Outlook. To do so:
	
	1. In Outlook, on the Tools menu, click Services.
	
	2. On the Services tab, click Microsoft Exchange Server, and then click
	  Properties.
	
	3. Click Advanced, and change the Logon network security setting to None.
	
	This procedure causes the Exchange Server Password dialog box to appear each time
	you start Outlook to connect with the Exchange Server computer. However, for
	this method to be effective, you must click Exit and Log Off from the File menu
	each time you step away from your computer.
	
	At the operating system level, if you use either Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft
	Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, you can use a Screen Saver password to
	protect your desktop. To do so:
	
	1. Right-click the desktop, and click Properties. You should see the Display
	  Properties dialog box.
	
	2. Click the Screen Saver tab, and click to select the Password Protected check
	  box.
	
	3. Click Change, and type a password.
	
	For this method to be effective, set the Wait time to a low number, such as 1
	minute. This way, shortly after you step away from your desk, the computer will
	be secured.
	
	If you use Windows NT, you also have the option to lock your workstation. To do
	so, press CTRL+ALT+DEL at the same time, and then click Lock Workstation. For
