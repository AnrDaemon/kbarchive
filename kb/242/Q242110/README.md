## Q242110: Keyboard intermittently stops responding on Compaq computers.

	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s):

	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On Compaq keyboards connected to computers running Microsoft Windows NT or
	Microsoft Windows 95, the light-emitting diode (LED) lights may intermittently
	turn on and off unexpectedly, and eventually the keyboard may stop responding
	(hang).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Static electricity may have caused the keyboard to hang or behave in unexpected
	ways. Your work environment may contribute to static buildup, which you can
	conduct to the keyboard.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent this issue from occurring, protect the computer from static
	electricity.
	
	Compaq has indicated that the newest keyboard models may not encounter this
	problem.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Electrostatic discharge (ESD), more commonly known as static electricity, can
	destroy electronic equipment immediately or cause hardware failure.
	
	Environmental conditions and methods of handling equipment determine whether ESD
	is a problem. Humidity reduces ESD risk because static electricity is carried
	away by water molecules; dry air is a poor conductor and increases the risk of
	ESD. Clothing, footwear, and flooring materials are important considerations
	when you evaluate the potential for ESD.
	
	The circuits within a computer's components are particularly sensitive to
	electrostatic discharge damage.
	
	When you install any new piece of computer equipment, work on a tile floor rather
	than on carpeting. Remove your shoes if possible, and roll up your shirt
	sleeves. If you set the component down, do not let the component touch the table
	before your hand touches the table.
	
	To minimize ESD problems, consider wearing a wrist strap when you are working on
	computer components. A wrist strap is a simple length of wire with a
	watchband-style strap at one end and a plug or clip on the other end. The plug
	or clip is connected to a common ground or to the piece of equipment being
	worked on. Sometimes a technician clips a connector (two alligator clips on a
	wire) between the watchband and the component.
