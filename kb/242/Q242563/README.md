	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To move your saved Age of Empires II games, campaigns, and scenarios to a
	different computer:
	
	1. On the original computer, use Microsoft Backup or a similar program to make a
	  backup of the following files
	
	  drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\SaveGame\*.*
	
	  drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\Campaign\*.*
	
	  drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\Scenario\*.*
	
	  drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\Player.nfo
	
	  where drive is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Age of Empires II is
	  installed.
	
	  NOTE: "*.*" represents all files located in the folder.
	
	2. Install Age of Empires II on a different computer.
	
	  NOTE: If Age of Empires II is already installed on the other computer, you may
	  want to rename the Player.nfo file on the other computer to preserve the
	  player name and campaign progress it contains.
	
	3. If Age of Empires II Expansion is installed on the original computer, install
	  it on the computer onto which you want to move the saved games.
	
	4. On the computer onto which you want to move the saved games, campaigns, and
	  scenarios, restore the files you backed up in step 1 to the appropriate
	  folders.
