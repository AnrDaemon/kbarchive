	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The sample application AAccess.vbp, which demonstrates Active Accessibility in
	"Advanced Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, Second Edition" ISBN 1-57231-893-7, does
	not function correctly with version 1.22 or later of the Active Accessibility
	SDK.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The sample application was originally written for use with Active Accessibility
	1.1. Changes in the Active Accessibility SDK have since made the sample
	application obsolete.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Download the self-extracting executable file Avb61.exe, which includes copies of
	the revised AAccess sample program files. Replace the files in the
	\chap16\AAccess folder with these files.
