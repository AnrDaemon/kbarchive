	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When creating static scenery, you can specify an elevation (altitude) for a
	runway. You cannot specify an altitude for other scenery such as roads, rivers,
	polygons, etc.
	
	Setting the altitude for a runway causes all scenery for a one mile radius around
	the runway to appear at the new altitude. The altitude of the runway will be
	accurately reflected by altimeter readings.
