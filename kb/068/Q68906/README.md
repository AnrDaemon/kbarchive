	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The stabilator trim control on the 747-400 enhanced panel performs the same
	function as the elevator trim on the Cessna; however, the indicator on the panel
	moves in the opposite direction.
	
	This is consistent with how the stabilator trim indicator appears on a real
	747-400.
