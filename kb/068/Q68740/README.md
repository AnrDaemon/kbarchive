	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When full throttle is applied, the 747 can remain stationary if the parking
	brake is engaged. The parking brake displays as a white bar at the bottom of the
	panel when it is on.
	
	The parking brake may be inadvertently engaged when you use speed brakes. When
	the speed brakes are deployed by pressing H, the parking brake is also engaged.
	
	To release the parking brake, press SHIFT+. (period).
