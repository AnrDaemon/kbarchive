	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	GeoGraphics is a Windows 3.0 geological survey application written by
	GeoGraphics Corporation. It offers the following two ways to plot or print
	survey maps:
	
	- The Display Print Map command prints from Windows.
	
	- The Display Plot Map command prints directly to GeoGraphics drivers,
	  bypassing Windows.
	
	If you use the Display Print Map command when you print or plot from Microsoft
	Windows version 3.0, you must configure the printer and port correctly. In
	addition, the printer must be the Active, Default printer.
