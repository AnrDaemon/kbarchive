	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Aircraft & Scenery Designer offers an enhanced aircraft designer. Although
	all aircraft can be modified, only the experimental aircraft can be fully
	modified. Aircraft that cannot be fully modified display the message "PARTIAL
	DESIGN ONLY" at the top of the designer menu.
	
	Features not available for a particular plane will generally not be shown. For
	example, option B, Color and Visual Design, is only available for the Cessna,
	Cessna Seaplane, and the experimental aircraft. It is not possible to change the
	color of the other planes (for example, the 747-400).
