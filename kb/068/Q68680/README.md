	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some SubLOGIC scenery disks do not load automatically after using the CONVERTS
	program supplied with Flight Simulator. It may be necessary to use the CONVERTS
	program provided by SubLOGIC in order to automatically load certain scenery.
	
	Newer scenery disks, such as SD-9, SDHawaii, and SD-12 include the SubLOGIC
	version of CONVERTS that allows the scenery to load automatically. The CONVERTS
	program is available from SubLOGIC Corporation at (217) 359-8482.
