	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may receive
	
	  insufficient memory error
	
	messages when you run E78PLUS software with the DCA IRMA board in Microsoft
	Windows version 3.0 in enhanced mode. This problem does not occur with Windows'
	real or standard modes.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The E78PLUS software included with the IRMA board does not work in enhanced mode
	under Windows 3.0.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	DCA suggests upgrading to its WindowLink program. WindowLink gives you the same
	3278/79 terminal emulation, micro-to-mainframe file transfer capabilities, and
	other features as E78PLUS. WindowLink also supports DDE (dynamic data exchange).
