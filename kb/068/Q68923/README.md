	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Flight Simulator aircraft are designed according to actual aircraft
	specifications. The aircraft have been developed by pilots and are further
	tested by other pilots prior to release.
	
	Because Flight Simulator is a simulation, there will be flight characteristics
	that are not perfectly realistic. Microsoft encourages feedback from pilots and
	uses such feedback to improve flight characteristics in future versions.
