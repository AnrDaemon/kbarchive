	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The ENTER key on the numeric keypad, which rotates the rudder to the right, will
	not function if you choose the Tandy 1000 keyboard option in the start-up menus
	while using a Tandy 1000SL computer.
	
	To correct the problem, run Flight Simulator and choose option B, "Function Keys
	on Top," in the start-up menus.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Tandy 1000SL computer is a newer variation of the original Tandy 1000. While
	the original Tandy 1000 had a nonstandard keyboard that requires the special
	selection in the menu, the 1000SL uses a standard extended-type PC keyboard.
	"Function Keys on Top" is the correct choice for this keyboard.
