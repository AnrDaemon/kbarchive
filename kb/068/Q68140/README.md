	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If an application workspace has been resized to be quite small, any modeless
	dialogs that are generated by the program may be clipped by the boundaries of
	the workspace window, making it difficult to see or access various fields and/or
	buttons.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Modeless dialogs allow you to access the application's menu bar, tool bar, and
	other documents opened by the application, without closing the dialog first.
	This generally allows a function or command to be applied to a number of
	different documents. A typical use for a modeless dialog would be a
	spell-checker dialog, such as the one used by PowerPoint for Windows.
	
	If modeless dialogs are implemented so that their parent window is the
	application window, the dialog must be contained within the boundaries of that
	application window. In addition, they may be implemented in such a way that they
	are actually treated like an open document in a MDI (multiple document
	interface) application, and appear under the application's Window menu along
	with the other open-document windows.
