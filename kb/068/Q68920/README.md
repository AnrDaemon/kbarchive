	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Enhanced Aircraft Designer allows aircraft numbers to be placed on the
	following planes:
	
	- Cessna
	
	- Cessna Seaplane
	
	- Experimental prop
	
	Although the Aircraft Number option appears for all experimental planes, the
	numbers will not appear on the aircraft. This is a design limitation of the
	software.
