	In Windows Write, the Save As dialog box under the File menu contains check
	boxes for saving a document in Text Only format or in Microsoft Word
	format. Because these options are check boxes instead of radio buttons,
	both formats can be selected at the same time. If both formats are checked,
	the document is saved as Text Only. To ensure that your document gets saved
	in the Microsoft Word format, check only the Microsoft Word format check
	box.
