	Program icons within program groups in Program Manager cannot be rearranged
	within the group window using a keyboard. This can only be accomplished using a
	mouse.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can move a program icon from one program group to another using the
	keyboard, but it is not possible to rearrange an icon within the group window
	using the keyboard.
	
	Use the following keyboard procedure to move a program icon from one program
	group to another:
	
	1. Using the arrow keys, highlight the icon to be moved.
	
	2. Press ALT+F to open the File menu.
	
	3. Press M to choose Move.
	
	4. Press ALT+DOWN ARROW to expand the To-group destination and select the
	  program group you want to move the icon to.
	
	5. Press ENTER.
	
	To simulate the reorganization of icons within a group:
	
	1. From the Options menu choose Auto Arrange.
	
	2. Create a new group.
	
	3. Copy the icons to the new group (using the F8 key) in the order you want them
	  arranged.
	
	4. Delete the original icons and group.
	
	5. Rename the new group if desired.
	
	You can also work around this problem by installing the Trace Access Pack for
	Windows. You can then use the number pad to control the mouse. For more
	information about obtaining the Trace Access Pack for Windows, query on the
	following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
