	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A large mountain may immediately disappear when added from the Static Scenery
	Designer menu in Aircraft & Scenery Designer (ASD) version 4.00.
	
	Smaller mountains work properly, and several smaller mountains may be placed to
	simulate a larger mountain.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
