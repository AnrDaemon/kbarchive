	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some COMPAQ portable computers have a Sleep button. Pressing this button
	temporarily suspends computer operations to save battery life. If you press this
	button while Microsoft Windows version 3.0 is running in the foreground, you may
	not get out of "sleep" mode without rebooting the computer. However, if you open
	an MS-DOS Prompt window, then press the Sleep button, the computer "sleeps" (and
	"wakes up"), just as the manual says it should.
