	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Aircraft & Scenery Designer, you can create a mountain with one or more
	blue sides. Flying into a blue mountain may cause Flight Simulator to display a
	"Splash" message rather than the appropriate "Crash" message.
	
	The wrong message displays because Flight Simulator uses scenery color to
	differentiate water from land and buildings.
