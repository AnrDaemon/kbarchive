	================
	
	Only the Zenith laptops (such as the TurbosPort 386, SupersPort 386e, and
	MinisPort) require the Zenith version of Windows 3.0.
	
	When you install Zenith's version of Windows on the TurbosPort 386, it may stop
	responding (hang) when you insert Disk 2 if you have selected the incorrect
	display. The TurbosPort 386 has a CGA display rather than an LCD display.
