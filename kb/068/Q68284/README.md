	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your mouse pointer may appear slightly distorted when you use an 8515 monitor
	and 8514/A adapter with Microsoft Windows version 3.0.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Installing a mouse driver in your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file can sometimes
	resolve this problem.
	
	Windows uses the MOUSE.DRV (or similar .DRV) file to provide a mouse to Windows
	and Windows applications. Installing a mouse driver at the MS-DOS level can
	sometimes provide a more stable configuration.
