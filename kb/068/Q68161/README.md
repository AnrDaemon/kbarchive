	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver for Microsoft
	Windows 3.0 supports both the HP DeskJet 500 and HP DeskJet PLUS printers. This
	printer driver is also completely compatible with the HP DeskJet printer, but
	the print speed is slower. The print quality is the same for all three HP
	DeskJet printers.
	
	The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver can be obtained from HP's fulfillment
	center (StarPack). The driver is free if you own an HP DeskJet 500 (the serial
	number of the printer must be provided) or can be purchased.
	
	NOTE: This driver can only be obtained from HP. Microsoft does not distribute
	this driver due to licensing agreements.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver incorporates the IntelliFont Scalable
	Outline Font system and includes three scalable typefaces from the HP MasterType
	Library: CG Times, Courier, and Univers. It can also be used with additional
	MasterType Library scalable typefaces.
	
	The IntelliFont type scaling technology scales and rasterizes the HP MasterType
	Library format typefaces on your computer. It has been built directly into the
	HP DeskJet 500 printer driver so you do not need HP Type Director 2.0 to use the
	scalable HP MasterType Library typefaces. If you have previously installed any
	HP MasterType Library typefaces with HP Type Director 2.0, you need to reinstall
	these typefaces by using the HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver.
	
	Information for installing HP MasterType Library format typefaces is available by
	choosing Troubleshooting from the Help menu in the HP DeskJet 500 Scalable On...
	dialog box.
	
	NOTE: The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver does not support internal
	printer fonts, font cartridges, or soft fonts. To access these fonts, use the HP
	DeskJet Family printer driver.
	
	The HP Deskjet 500 does not physically print graphics in landscape mode. Instead,
	it sends the graphic out in portrait mode and rotates it to appear in landscape
	mode.
	
	The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver requires approximately 1 MB of free
	disk space for installation of the driver and the three printer fonts that come
	with it (Courier, CG Times, and Universe).
	
	To use the HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver for Microsoft Windows 3.0, do
	the following through the Windows Control Panel:
	
	1. Install the driver and its support files on your hard disk.
	
	2. Select printer settings.
	
	3. Install printer fonts.
	
	4. Create screen fonts (optional).
	
	5. Activate your printer.
	
	For information on installing unlisted printer drivers, please refer to pages
	158-174, "Installing a Printer," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
	
	The HP products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
