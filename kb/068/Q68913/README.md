	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Boeing 747-400 will not be visible to the other player in multiplayer mode.
	The floats on the Cessna 182 seaplane are also not visible in multiplayer mode.
	
	The problem is due to limitations in the multiplayer feature and the aircraft
	details that can be communicated to another player.
	
	To properly send aircraft types between players, select an aircraft other than
	the 747-400.
