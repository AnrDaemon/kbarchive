	=======
	
	With File Manager's Change Attributes function, it is possible to set attributes
	for subdirectories as well as files. Hidden subdirectories do not appear in
	directory windows, the directory tree, or directory listings from MS-DOS as long
	as the listings are not set to include hidden files.
