## Q68242: Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade vs. Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0

	Article: Q68242
	Product(s): Microsoft Disk Operating System
	Version(s): MS-DOS:5.0
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft MS-DOS is not a retail product. Microsoft licenses MS-DOS to original
	equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to sell with their computers. This includes the
	Microsoft MS-DOS packaged product, which some OEMs bundle with their machines.
	
	Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 is also licensed to OEMs. Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 includes a
	new installation program designed to set up a brand-new machine. If necessary,
	Setup will partition and format the hard disk before installing MS-DOS. When
	installing MS-DOS version 5.0 over an earlier version of MS-DOS on a hard disk,
	SETUP.EXE will delete the previous MS-DOS files, rename your previous
	AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files, and install MS-DOS 5.0, including new
	AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.
	
	Note: This information is based on the Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 packaged product.
	Depending on an OEM's licensing agreement with Microsoft, SETUP.EXE may be
	changed by the OEM. For details on a particular OEM's SETUP.EXE, see your MS-DOS
	5.0 documentation, or ask your OEM or dealer.
	
	Microsoft is also introducing something new: the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade.
	Unlike Microsoft MS-DOS, the Upgrade is a Microsoft retail product, sold by
	Microsoft in the same way as Word or Windows.
	
	Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade is intended for those who have MS-DOS version 2.11 or
	later and who want to upgrade their current MS-DOS system to version 5.0.
	Because it assumes that you already have an MS-DOS system in place, the
	Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade disks are not bootable. The Microsoft MS-DOS 5
	Upgrade's SETUP.EXE will upgrade the current MS-DOS system to version 5.0, and
	it will not partition, repartition, or format a hard disk while doing so.
	
	Because of the issues involved in upgrading from any OEM's MS-DOS 2.11 (or later)
	to MS-DOS 5.0, one of the features of the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade is the
	option to return to the previous version of MS-DOS. Should you decide, for any
	reason, to return to the previous MS-DOS system, the UNINSTALL option will allow
	you to do so easily.
	
	The differences between Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade and Microsoft MS-DOS 5 are as
	follows:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade can be purchased in retail outlets. According to
	  Microsoft licensing agreements, MS-DOS can be purchased only with a computer
	  from the OEM, or as an upgrade from the OEM.
	
	- The Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade SETUP.EXE program is different from the
	  Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 SETUP.EXE.
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade allows you to uninstall and return to the previous
	  MS-DOS system.
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade disks are nonbootable. Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0, like
	  previous versions of MS-DOS, contains a bootable floppy disk.
	
	- Several network redirectors ship with Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade to make it
	  easier to upgrade a networked machine.
	
	- Technical support for the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade is available for the
	  first 90 days of product ownership by calling (425) 646-5104. Technical
	  support for the OEM version should be obtained from the OEM, or as an
	  alternative, from Microsoft at (900) 896-9000.
	
	For more information on installing MS-DOS version 5.0 over a previous version of
	MS-DOS, query on the following words:
	
	  "MSDOS" (without the quotation marks) and "5.0" (without the quotation marks)
	  and "upgrade" (without the quotation marks) and "OEM" (without the quotation
	  marks) and "installation" (without the quotation marks)
