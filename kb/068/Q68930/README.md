	The CAD software package CADKEY requires that the Microsoft Mouse
	driver be updated to version 7.04 to run properly. Earlier
	versions of the driver, such as version 7.00, will not allow you to
	operate the mouse correctly in this software. In one instance, the
	cursor is confined to a small area of the upper-left-hand corner of
	the screen.
	
	CADKEY is produced and marketed by CADKEY Inc. The technical support
	number is (203) 647-9235. The CADKEY Inc. product referenced here is
	manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
	implied or otherwise, regarding the product's performance or
	reliability.
