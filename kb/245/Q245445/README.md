	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Asheron's Call, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click Submit to redeem the subscription coupon number for Microsoft
	Asheron's Call, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  The Subscription Coupon Number you entered has already been redeemed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when the subscription coupon number has already been used.
	The Asheron's Call subscription coupon is only good for one subscription. After
	the coupon is redeemed on an account, it will not be asked for or can it be used
	again.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you are the owner of the coupon number, then you are logging in with the
	wrong account. If you are not the owner or are trying to redeem the coupon on
	more then one account, you need to purchase additional copies of the product. To
	do this, follow the steps below:
	
	Sign In With the Correct .NET Passport
	--------------------------------------
	
	1. Go to the following Zone.com Web site:
	
	  http://zone.msn.com/services/support.asp
	
	2. If you need to, on the top of the page, click Sign In to sign in with a .NET
	  Passport.
	
	3. Click My Zone, and then verify that the Billing section is populated with the
	  game you want to play. If not, repeat the previous steps for any additional
	  .NET Passports that you may have. Skip this if you only have one .NET
	  Passport.
	
	Change Your MSN Nickname Currently Associated With Your .NET Passport
	---------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	1. Go to the following Zone.com Web site:
	
	  http://zone.msn.com/services/support.asp
	
	2. If you need to, on the top of the page, click Sign In to sign in with a .NET
	  Passport, and then click My Zone.
	
	3. Click Change Nickname.
	
	4. Under "Reactivate a Nickname", if there is a list of previously associated
	  MSN Nicknames please click one, and then click Yes.
	
	5. Click My Zone, and then verify that the Billing section is populated with the
	  game you want to play. If not, repeat the previous steps and select a
	  different MSN Nickname, if available, from the list of previously associated
	  MSN Nicknames.
	
	Obtain Additional Coupons
	-------------------------
	
	Because you can only use a coupon one time, if you want to have multiple
	subscriptions on additional MSN Nicknames, you must obtain a new subscription
	number for each additional subscription you want to have.
	
	Return the Product
	------------------
	
	If you are sure that no one has used the coupon included in your copy of
	Asheron's Call, please exchange your copy of Asheron's Call for a new one from
	the point of purchase.
	
	Contact Billing Support
	-----------------------
	
	If you are still unable to resolve this issue, please contact Billing Support at
	the following Zone.com web site for additional assistance:
