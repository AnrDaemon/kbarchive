	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The "Starting Flight Simulator" section on page 2 of the Pilot's Handbook for
	Flight Simulator 2000, incorrectly states that you need to insert the Disc 1
	CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive to start or play the game.
	
	This is a typographical error. To start or play the game, you may need to insert
	the Disc 2 CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you choose the Custom installation option when you install Flight Simulator,
	you may be able to start the program with the Disc 1 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive
	depending upon the installation options you select.
	
	If you choose the Typical installation option, you must always start Flight
	Simulator with the Disc 2 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.
