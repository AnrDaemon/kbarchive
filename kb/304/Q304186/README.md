	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you configure the properties of a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) virtual
	server, the buttons on the Security Accounts tab to add and remove operators are
	unavailable. As a result, administrators are unable to add or remove users or
	groups as site operators.
	
	STATUS

	This behavior is by design.
