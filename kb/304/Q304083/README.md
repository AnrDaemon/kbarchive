## Q304083: XADM: Can't Use CDO to Remove Attendees from Recurring Meeting

	Article: Q304083
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 5.5,5.5 SP1,5.5 SP2,5.5 SP3,5.5 SP4
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbExchange550preSP5fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) to try to remove a user from an
	instance of a recurring appointment item, and then try to send an update to that
	user alone by changing the status to "CdoMeetingCanceled," all of the users may
	be notified. The code works correctly on a non-recurring appointment item.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

	NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
	be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
	update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
