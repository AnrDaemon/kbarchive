	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the information store attempts to convert a Multipurpose Internet Mail
	Extensions (MIME) message with an invalid format, the Exchange Server
	Information Store service may stop unexpectedly or may generate a Dr. Watson
	access violation.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if the Content-Type field of a MIME message that is being
	converted contains invalid characters.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
	phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
