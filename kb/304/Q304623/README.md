	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may want to move your existing Qwest.net Web site to your MSN Communities
	Web site.
	
	There are two approaches for creating your MSN Communities Web site from your
	Qwest.net site:
	
	- Transfer your existing Web pages to the MSN Communities file cabinet and then
	  view the pages from the file cabinet.
	
	- Create your Web pages using the MSN Communities Web page editor.
	
	Consider the following before deciding which approach to take:
	
	File Cabinet
	------------
	
	- Your Web pages must be updated on your computer and then uploaded to your MSN
	  Communities site.
	
	- Your Web site does not have Microsoft advertising or framing. Your existing
	  navigation and frames are supported.
	
	- Your Web site generally does not need to be redesigned or restructured. In
	  most cases, file and directory locations names are retained.
	
	MSN Communities Web Page Editor
	-------------------------------
	
	- Pages can be updated using the MSN Communities HTML editor
	
	- Your Web frames are not supported. Your Web site is embedded in the MS
	  Communities site.
	
	- Requires more HTML knowledge for complex Web pages.
	
	Other Considerations
	--------------------
	
	- The maximum size per file is 1,059,062 bytes.
	
	- The maximum number of files per File Cabinet is 500.
	
	- The maximum number of nested folders in a File Cabinet is 9.
	
	- The maximum amount of content in your MSN Community account is 30 MB.
	
	- You can not use FTP, Netscape Composer, or Microsoft FrontPage to publish
	  your Web site.
	
	- FrontPage components on pages authored with FrontPage will not work.

	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To move your Web site to the MSN Communities File Cabinet
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	First, you must move your Qwest.net Web site to your computer. If you do not
	already have your Qwest.net Web site saved on your computer, you can use FTP or
	FrontPage to transfer it to your computer.
	
	Moving your Web site files to the MSN Communities file cabinet is an iterative
	process. You create a folder in the MSN Communities File Cabinet and then copy
	the files to the folder from your computer. If your Web was authored with
	FrontPage, you do not need to copy any of the FrontPage control folders or their
	contents to the File Cabinet. The FrontPage control folders are as follows:
	
	- _private
	
	- _vti_bin
	
	- _vti_cnt
	
	- _vti_pvt
	
	- _vti_txt
	
	Also, if your Web site was authored with FrontPage or you added security using
	.htaccess files, you do not need to copy the .htaccess files. They are not used
	by MSN Communities Web pages.
	
	1. Sign on to your MS Communities Web site at
	  http://communities.msn.com/YOUR_COMMUNITY_NAME where YOUR_COMMUNITY_NAME is
	  the name of your MSN Community.
	
	2. Click File Cabinet, and then click the Add File link.
	
	3. Click My Computer and then locate your saved Web site.
	
	4. Select the top-level directory of your site.
	  The files in this directory will then be displayed.
	
	5. Select all the files you want copied, and then click the Upload Now button.
	
	6. Either wait for the upload to complete or click the link to return to your
	  File Cabinet.
	  If your Web has any directories in it, you must create a folder for each
	  directory, from the File Cabinet screen. Select Create Folder and then enter
	  the same folder name as your directory. If you want to restrict access to the
	  new folder, set the folder's permission, and then click Create Folder. The
	  folder will be created and the File Cabinet screen will be displayed again.
	  Create additional folders to match each directory in the corresponding
	  Qwest.net Web site on your computer.
	
	7. In the File Cabinet, click a Folder name, and then follow steps 2 and 3 above
	  to copy the files that are in the corresponding saved Qwest.net Web site
	  folder.
	
	8. Repeat this step to upload files to each of the folders.
	
	9. Continue to upload your Web by creating Folders and uploading the files from
	  your computer for the folders.
