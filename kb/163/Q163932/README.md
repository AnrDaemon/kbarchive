	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. What are Word macro viruses?
	
	  A. Macro viruses are computer viruses that use an application's own macro
	  programming language to distribute themselves. These macros have the
	  potential to inflict damage to the document or to other computer software.
	  These macro viruses can infect Word files, as well as any other application
	  that uses a programming language.
	
	  Unlike previous viruses, macro viruses do not infect programs; they infect
	  documents and templates. Opening a document or template that contains a macro
	  virus will infect your system and the virus will spread to other documents
	  and templates you may have on your system. Some macro viruses are not
	  harmful, but they can be annoying. However, there are some macro viruses that
	  can be very destructive. Also, Word macro viruses can be spread across
	  platforms; for example, the macro virus can infect files on the Windows
	  platform, as well as files on the Macintosh platform.
	
	2. Q. How can I determine whether I have a Word macro virus?
	
	  A. It is not always easy to determine whether you have a macro virus. If you
	  are familiar with the Word macros you have on your system, you can look
	  through the various macros for ones that you do not recognize. It is possible
	  that one, or more, of them are part of a macro virus that has infected your
	  system. Some examples of these type of macro names are: AAAZAO, AAAZFS,
	  AutoOpen, FileSaveAs, and PayLoad.
	
	  Some other things to look for are:
	
	   - Unexplainable behavior on your system; for example, you may be prompted
	     for a password on a file that you know does not contain a password or your
	     document may be unexpectedly saved as a template.
	
	   - Unusual error messages, for example:
	
	  This one's for you, Bosco.
	
	  -or-
	
	  ROBERTA TI AMO!
	
	  -or-
	
	  Just to prove another point.
	
	  -or-
	
	  And finally I would like to say: STOP ALL FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE
	  PACIFIC!
	
	   - Unusual changes to your documents; for example, the macro virus may
	     randomly move three words then insert the word "WAZZU" at random
	     locations.
	
	3. Q. How did I get the macro virus?
	
	  A. You worked with a file that was infected with a Word macro virus. An
	  infected file can be obtained any of the following sources
	
	  disks
	  networks
	  email attachments
	  modems
	  the Internet
	
	  You may want to obtain a current macro virus detection program to prevent
	  obtaining future macro viruses and to get rid of your existing macro viruses.
	
	4. Q. If I have a Word macro virus on my system, can I accidentally spread the
	  macro virus to others?
	
	  A. Yes. You can spread a virus if you share files with others. A macro virus
	  embeds itself into your file and can, most commonly, spread to others if you
	  share files from a disk, network drive, external drive media, or any of a
	  number of other file transfer methods. Files exchanged over the Internet can
	  also spread the macro virus to others.
	
	5. Q. Can I get software that will prevent me from getting a Word macro virus in
	  the future?
	
	  A. Microsoft Technical Support recommends that you use a third-party company
	  that provides Word macro virus detection and protection. There are many
	  companies that provide this service.

	6. Q. Are there other ways that I can get a Word macro virus off my system?
	
	  A. Yes, there are some temporary workarounds that you can use to clean a macro
	  virus off your system. These methods will not prevent the future infection of
	  your system. Please refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
	
	  Q181079 WD97: What to Do If You Have a Macro Virus
	
	7. Q. I have Word and it always prompts me about the file I am opening
	  containing macros. I don't share files or disks with others, I don't even
	  download files from the Internet. Can I prevent Word from prompting me all
	  the time with this warning?
	
	  A. Yes, you can disable the macro virus warning, although Microsoft does not
	  recommend it. To disable the macro virus warning:
	
	  a. On the Tools menu, click Options
	
	  b. Click the General tab.
	
	  c. Click to clear the "Macro virus protection" check box.
	
	  d. Click OK.
	
	  This macro virus warning will not appear anymore.
	
	8. Q. Word provides the macro virus warning when I open files that may contain
	  macros, except when I open files from my templates folder. Why the
	  difference?
	
	  A. Word assumes that you know which files you have saved to your templates
	  folder. It also assumes that you know these files are safe. With this
	  assumption, Word does not provide the macro virus warning when it detects
	  macros contained in files from your template folders. The template folders
	  that Word uses are defined by the User Templates and Workgroup Templates
	  settings as specified in the File Locations tab in the Options dialog box.
	
	9. Q. Are there macro viruses that affect other Microsoft Office applications?
	
	  A. Yes. For more information on macro viruses for the other Microsoft Office
