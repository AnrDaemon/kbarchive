	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to set the Sent Time and/or Expiration properties on a custom
	message (for example, a Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer Form) using the
	Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 Client, the properties will not be saved. Because
	the properties are never saved, the message will be sent immediately and/or will
	not expire.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Windows
	95 Client.
