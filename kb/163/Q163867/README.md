## Q163867: XCLN: Responses to Meeting Requests not Saved in Sent Items

	Article: Q163867
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 7.0 7.5
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.0, 7.5 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When a Microsoft Schedule+ user accepts or declines a meeting request, a record
	of that sent message will be kept in the sent items folder only if the user adds
	additional text to the response.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Schedule+ implements what are called silent responses. A silent response is a
	response to a meeting request that has NO additional text added to it. Clicking
	accept or decline and then sending that response creates these silent responses.
	Silent responses will not be saved in the sent items folder nor will the be
	displayed in a Microsoft Exchange recipient's inbox. Silent responses do exist
	in the deleted items folder for the sender and recipient.
	
	If the person accepting or declining the meeting request places any text in their
	meeting response, it will be saved in the Sent Items folder.
	
	This behavior is by product design.
