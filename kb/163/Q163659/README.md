	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you turn on the "Track Changes while editing" command and mark text for
	deletion, when you save the document as HTML and reopen the document, the
	deleted text appears in the document and it is not marked as deleted text (that
	is, it looks like normal text).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	HTML does not support marking for tracked changes.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Accept all tracked changes before you save the document as HTML.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
	This problem does not occur in Microsoft Word 2000.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior is different from Word 7.0 and Internet Assistant. These products
	removed text that was marked for deletion when the document was converted.
