	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Visual SourceSafe 5.0 allows the SourceSafe Administrator to lock the database
	so that no other users can login. This does not affect users who are already
	logged in. This article explains how an Administrator can lock out users.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To lock a Visual SourceSafe 5.0 database perform the following steps from the
	Visual SourceSafe Admin tool.
	
	On the Tools menu, click Lock SourceSafe database.
	
	A dialog box warns you that there are users currently logged in. Once the
	SourceSafe database is locked, only users who try to login after the database
	has been locked are affected. Users who are currently logged in are not logged
	out.
