	Microsoft Plus! For Kids installs several different desktop themes. But when the
	program is removed, the desktop wallpaper is automatically set to None. This
	happens even if you specified your own bitmap as the wallpaper.

	If your wallpaper gets set to None, set your Wallpaper back to the desired
	background using the following steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Display.
	
	3. On the Background tab, select the Wallpaper you want to use for your desktop.
	
	4. Click Apply, and then click OK. Your wallpaper will now be set to the desired
	  background.
