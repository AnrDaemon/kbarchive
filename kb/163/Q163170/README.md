	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Policy Editor (PolEdit) and Protect It! can interfere with each other
	if they are run concurrently.
	
	For example, if you are restricted with Protect It! and then unrestricted with
	PolEdit, the Start menu will not rebuild correctly. The Start menu will still
	reflect the restrictions that were set in Protect It!, however, applications are
	still available through Explorer or the Run line.
