	is an extension product installed on top of Microsoft Systems Management

	For technical support issues, contact:
	
	- Microsoft Technical Support if the issue involves the basic fuctionality of
	  Microsoft Systems Management Server (for example, if you are having
	  difficulty installing the Systems Management Server client software on a
	  client computer running Windows 95).

	  involves the AssetWORKS extended functionality (for example, if you are

	For a period of time, Digital did market a Systems Management Server 1.0 and
	AssetWORKS 1.x as a "bundle" (a two-disc compact disc set).
