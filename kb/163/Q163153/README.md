	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Suggest button is missing from the Spelling dialog box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Microsoft Word 97 for Windows uses a different Spelling dialog box than the
	other Microsoft Office 97 programs.
	
	This is because Word includes a grammar checking tool, as well as a spelling
	checker. These two tools are available from the same dialog box. By default,
	Word suggests corrections for words and grammatical errors.
	
	The Suggestions list is unavailable if you have cleared the "Always suggest
	corrections" check box on the "Spelling & Grammar" tab of the Options dialog
	box.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To set or clear the "Always Suggest Corrections" check box, use either of the
	following methods.
	
	Method 1: If the Spelling Checker Is Not Running
	------------------------------------------------
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Options.
	
	2. Click the Spelling & Grammar tab.
	
	3. Under Spelling, select or clear the "Always Suggest Corrections" check box.
	
	Method 2: If the Spelling Checker Is Running
	--------------------------------------------
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Spelling & Grammar (Spelling).
	
	2. Click Options.
	
	3. On the Spelling & Grammar tab, under Spelling, select or clear the
	  "Always Suggest Corrections" check box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For spelling errors, Word lists suggested replacement words from the main
	dictionary and open custom dictionaries. For grammar errors, Word lists
	suggested corrections based on the current grammar style and grammar settings.
	
	Previous versions of Word allowed you to use wild card characters in a text
	string and click Suggest to get additional words from the dictionary. For
	example, typing "d*g" and clicking on Suggest gave you a list of all words that
	began with the letter "d" and ended with letter "g".
	
	To accomplish this task in Microsoft Word 97, type "d*g" in the Not In Dictionary
	box, and click Change. The word will change in your document, but Word will also
	list all of the alternative suggestions from the dictionary. You can then click
	on the suggestion you want and it will change the word in your document.
