	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	MSB Human Body and MSB Solar System will launch from an installation on a
	removable drive, but MSB Ocean, MSB Earth, and MSB Dinosaurs will not. These
	programs were designed to run from an installation to a physical hard drive with
	the compact disc inserted in the CD-ROM drive. These programs were not designed
	to run from any other media source.
	
	It is possible to set your hard drive to be "removeable". To determine whether
	this option is selected and/or to select it, do the following:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the System icon in Control Panel.
	
	3. On the Device Manager tab, click the plus (+) sign next to Disk Drives.
	
	4. Select the item that describes your hard disk (i.e., GENERIC IDE DISK
	  TYPE38), and then click the Properties button.
	
	5. Click the Settings tab and verify that the Removable check box is not
	  selected.
	
	6. Click OK. Restart the computer when prompted.
