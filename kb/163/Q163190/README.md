	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you review tracked changes in a document that is protected for tracked
	changes, the Accept All and Reject All buttons are available in the Accept or
	Reject Changes dialog box. However, neither button will accept or reject changes
	in the document.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To accept or reject tracked changes, you must unprotect the document by clicking
	Unprotect Document on the Tools menu and typing a password (if the document was
	protected using a password).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.<A0> This problem was corrected in
	Microsoft Word 2000.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When the document is protected for tracked changes, the Accept All and Reject
	All buttons should be unavailable (dimmed), because accepting or rejecting
	tracked changes is not allowed in a document that is protected for tracked
	changes.
	
	To find the Accept All and Reject All buttons, point to Track Changes on the
	Tools menu and then click "Accept or Reject Changes".
