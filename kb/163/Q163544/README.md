	Article: Q163544
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	If you paste a large OLE object into a message in the Microsoft Exchange
	Macintosh client, click on the Inbox window, and then immediately back on the
	message window before the paste has completed, the open message window and the
	Inbox window may toggle the focus back and forth.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	There are two workarounds for this problem:
	
	1. Wait until the paste operation is completed before clicking back and forth on
	  the Inbox and message windows.
	
	2. Update the Apple System software to version 7.5.5 and add more memory on the
	  system.
	
	Both of these will increase the speed of the paste operation.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0, of Microsoft
	Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
