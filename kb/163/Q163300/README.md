	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Web page authoring tools are provided with Microsoft Word and with other
	Microsoft Office programs to enable you to easily create various types of Web
	pages. Another Microsoft program, called FrontPage, also helps you create
	various types of Web pages by using an interface similar to other Office
	programs. FrontPage also helps you to manage a Web site.
	
	To create Web pages, you can use the Web page authoring tools in Microsoft Word,
	Microsoft FrontPage, or both. Both programs provide wizards to automate your
	work, and both enable you to view your Web page content, such as bullets and
	images, as you work. There are some purposes, however, for which one program is
	better suited.
	
	Use Web page authoring tools in Microsoft Word when:
	
	- You want to use the robust word-processing features in Word, such as
	  automatic spelling checking, AutoText, and AutoCorrect.
	
	- Other Web page authors whom you work with frequently use Word.
	
	- You have customized Word features, such as AutoText, custom dictionaries, and
	  AutoCorrect entries, that you want to use when creating Web pages.
	
	Use FrontPage when:
	
	- You want to use A WebBot component to insert scripts and form elements, such
	  as server includes and time stamps. A WebBot component enables the Web page
	  designer to quickly add sophisticated interactive functions, such as search
	  tools or timestamps.
	
	- You are working with a large team or managing a Web server.
	
	- You need user authentication for Web page authors.
	
	NOTE: In Microsoft FrontPage Explorer, you can specify Word as your default
	editor for HTML files. See FrontPage documentation for more information.
