	Article: Q163205

	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you try to drag a file into the Exchange Macintosh client, the file returns
	to the original location without completing the operation. The Exchange
	Macintosh client does not have drag-and-drop capabilities between the operating
	system and Exchange. Therefore, you cannot drag a file from the desktop to a
	folder or an open message.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	You can work around this problem by using the menu or toolbar buttons in the
	Exchange Macintosh client.
	
	To insert a file into an open message:
	
	1. On the Insert menu, click File.
	
	2. Select the file you want to insert.
	
	3. Click Close.
	
	Toolbar buttons are available for all of the Insert menu options. To enable them,
	open a message and perform the following steps:
	
	1. On the View menu, click Toolbar.
	
	2. Double-click the toolbar. The Customize Toolbar dialog box will appear.
	
	3. In the Available buttons box, locate the "Insert - File," "Insert - Message,"
	  or "Insert - Object" button.
	
	4. Drag a button to the desired location in the Toolbar buttons box.
	
	5. Click Close.
	
	These buttons allow you to insert files, messages, and objects into an open
	message.
	
	To insert a file directly into a folder from the Macintosh client:
	
	1. Double-click the Macintosh client toolbar. The Customize Toolbar dialog box
	  will appear.
	
	2. In the Available buttons box, drag the "File - Insert" button to the desired
	  location in the Toolbar buttons box.
	
	3. If you want to change the location of the new button, drag it up or down in
	  the Toolbar buttons box.
	
	4. Click Close.
	
	The Insert button is now available on the Exchange Client toolbar. Open any
	public or personal folder. Click the Insert button and select the file that you
	want to post to the selected folder. There is no message; the file itself is
	posted to the folder.
