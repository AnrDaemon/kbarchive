	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When Microsoft Schedule+ files are kept on a Microsoft Exchange server, the
	schedules may be viewed and modified by other Microsoft Schedule+ users on both
	the Windows and the Macintosh platforms, if those users have been granted
	permissions to view or modify the schedules. In contrast, if the Microsoft
	Schedule+ files are stored locally, users on the Macintosh platform cannot view
	or modify the Microsoft Schedule+ files on the Windows-based computer, and vice
	versa.
	
	MORE INFORMATION

	Schedule+, version 7.5 in the same executable. Microsoft Schedule+ for the
