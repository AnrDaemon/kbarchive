	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using an Apex Data Mobile Plus cellular V.34 PCMCIA modem on a
	portable computer with Windows 95, you may not hear an audible tone through the
	speaker when the modem is dialing or negotiating a connection.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur with some early versions of the Apex Data Mobile Plus
	cellular V.34 PCMCIA modem using the Rockwell chip set that use the PC speaker
	for sound during dialing and answering. On some portable computers, these modems

	  playback option is enabled. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	  1. In Control Panel, double-click Multimedia.
	
	  2. On the Audio tab, verify that the sound card is selected as the preferred
	     device in the Playback area.
	
	  3. Adjust the Playback Volume control to High.
	
	  4. Click OK.
	
	- Contact Apex Data for help with determining the card's chip set version and
