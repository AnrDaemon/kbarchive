	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you play the Name Game in The Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of
	Dinosaurs, the Close Captioning may not match the placement of the syllable
	crystals.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can play the Name Game by clicking the Game Selector on the left hand side
	of the back of the bus. The Game Selector cycles through all of the available
	games.
	
	The object of the Name Game is to arrange the syllable crystals in the correct
	order to pronounce the name of the dinosaur. When you have placed the crystals,
	you can click on the mouth to have the syllables read aloud. Close Captioning
	will always show the correct name of the dinosaur, not the mixed-syllable
	attempts.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in The Magic School Bus Explores in
	the Age of Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0. We are researching this problem
	and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
