	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have a Word 97 document containing a drawing object that is composed of
	several grouped line drawings, and you save it in Word 6.0/95 format or Rich
	Text Format (RTF), it may appear in Word 7.0 as a single square box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a limitation to the drawing feature in Word 7.0. Word 97 has a drawing
	feature that is much more flexible than Word 7.0; therefore, there are some Word
	97 drawing features that cannot be supported in Word 7.0.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Ungroup the drawing object in Word 97 by following these steps:
	
	1. Click the drawing object to select it.
	
	2. On the drawing toolbar, click Ungroup on the Draw menu.
	
	3. Save the document as Word 6.0/95 or Rich Text Format (RTF)
