	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you work in a master document containing a subdocument that has revisions,
	the following problems may be encountered:
	
	- The Accept, Reject, Accept All and Reject All buttons in the Accept or Reject
	  Changes dialog are unavailable so you can't review your changes.
	
	- When you click the Find button in the Accept or Reject Changes dialog box,
	  you receive the error message "Word found no tracked changes."
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Method 1: Expand Your Subdocument
	---------------------------------
	
	1. Open your master document.
	
	2. If your subdocument is not expanded, you will see a hyperlink in place of the
	  subdocument. On the Master Document toolbar, click the Expand Subdocuments
	  button.
	
	  This will open your subdocument inside the master document.
	
	3. On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click Accept or Reject
	  Changes.
	
	Method 2: Open the Subdocument
	------------------------------
	
	1. Open your master document.
	
	2. If your subdocument is not expanded, you will see a hyperlink in place of the
	  subdocument. Click the hyperlink.
	
	  This will open your subdocument as a separate file.
	
	3. On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click Accept or Reject
	  Changes.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you open a master document, all subdocuments are collapsed--that is, each
	subdocument appears as a hyperlink. Word cannot display revisions in a
	subdocument if the subdocument hyperlink is visible.
	
	You can click a hyperlink to open the subdocument and work on it in its own
	window. If you prefer to work on the master document as a whole, you can expand
	the subdocuments and work on them in place or switch to normal view.
