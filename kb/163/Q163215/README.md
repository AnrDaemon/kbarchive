	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Third-party vendors are offering solutions for alternative logon methods, such
	as using chipcards or additional network validation. If you use such a
	third-party GINA, you may find that System Policies no longer work correctly.
	
	A popular example for such a GINA is included with Novell's IntranetWare NT
	Client Services version 4.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A third party GINA is responsible for telling Winlogon about available system
	policies. You should contact the vendor about an update for the GINA package.
	
	
	The third party products discussed here are manufactured by a vendor independent
	of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
	products' performance or reliability.
