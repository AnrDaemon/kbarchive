	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When copying and pasting records from one data file into another, or pasting
	records at the end of the current data file, the Paste command will be gray if
	the "new" record is not selected.
	
	The new record is always the last record in the data file window. It is selected
	by clicking the word "New" to the left of the empty record. Paste will become
	available once New is selected.
