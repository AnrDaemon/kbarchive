## Q27763: CODEVIEW.DOC Incorrectly States /E Uses Extended Memory

	Article: Q27763
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 2.20
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | docerr | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 10-NOV-1988
	
	The CODEVIEW.DOC file included in Microsoft C Version 5.10 states that
	the /E switch enables use of extended memory for CodeView's symbol
	table.
	
	This is a documentation error in the CODEVIEW.DOC file. CodeView uses
	expanded, not extended memory.
