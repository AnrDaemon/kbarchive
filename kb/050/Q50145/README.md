	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The documentation on page 76 of the Microsoft Mail "Network Manager's Guide"
	states that a unique name must be given for the graphic overlay field. This
	information is incomplete.
	
	The documentation does not state that this unique name must include the word
	"Overlay" at the end. If this unique name doesn't include the word "Overlay,"
	the graphic field does not appear. By default the Graphic Overlay field has the
	name "Overlay." If there are multiple overlay fields, each overlay must have a
	unique name which ends with the word "Overlay."
	
	Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
