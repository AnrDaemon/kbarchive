	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A security feature was added to Microsoft Mail version 3.0 that requires you to
	type in your current password before you can enter a new password using the
	Change Password command in the Mail menu. After pressing the OK button, another
	dialog box will appear asking you to enter the new password again to verify it.
	
	Using Mail version 2.0, users are not protected from having their passwords
	inadvertently changed after logging onto their mail accounts. The user is not
	required to enter the old password before entering the new one or to type the
	new password twice to verify that it was spelled correctly.
