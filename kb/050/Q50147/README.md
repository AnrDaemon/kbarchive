	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	An AppleTalk bridge links two AppleTalk networks with the same ID. It is
	commonly used to overcome the AppleTalk limitation of 32 nodes per segment. With
	a bridge, the AppleTalk segment is split into two segments (with the same ID),
	allowing each segment to hold 32 nodes.
	
	NOTE: Depending on the type of connectors, cable, and topology you are using,
	each AppleTalk segment can expand a signal up to a fixed cable length.
	
	An AppleTalk router links two AppleTalk networks with different IDs. It is
	commonly used to connect different AppleTalk networks on a local area network
	(LAN). For example, in a company X, the Sales department has an AppleTalk
	network (with ID = 10) and the Inventory department has another one (with ID =
	20). An AppleTalk router can link these two AppleTalk networks.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are several brands of bridges and routers used with AppleTalk networks;
	some can act as both a bridge and/or a router. If you want to know about some of
	these devices, please contact your local Apple dealer. Microsoft does not sell
	any bridges or routers for AppleTalk networks.
