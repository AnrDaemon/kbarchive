	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you create a custom form and the Auto Tab option is set in a field, the
	RETURN key has no effect on that field once the form is installed in Mail. This
	limitation is necessary for fields such as the Subject, which are only one-line
	text fields.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the RETURN key does not advance to a new line in a scrollable field, do the
	following:
	
	1. Open the form in the Forms Designer.
	
	2. Select the field tool and double-click on the field in question.
	
	3. Make sure that the Auto Tab option is not selected.
	
	4. Compile and reinstall the form.
