	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator Version 4.00, during Taxiing lessons in Flight Instruction
	mode, the instructor says "Think of the winds, jet blasts, and fuel inlets."
	Note that fuel inlets have nothing to do with taxiing.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
