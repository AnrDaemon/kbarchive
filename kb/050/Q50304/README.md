	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00, if you crash in the World War I
	(WWI) Ace from the Entertainment menu, your score remains the same when the
	program automatically resets to the beginning of that mode.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
