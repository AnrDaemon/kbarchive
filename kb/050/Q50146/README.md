	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Installer on the Microsoft Mail Server disk does not automatically install
	the Microsoft Mail workstation software. The user should run the Installer from
	the Workstation Version disk.
	
	Please note that to log on to Microsoft Mail from the server Macintosh, the
	workstation software must also be installed on that Macintosh.
	
	For workstation installation procedures, see the "Microsoft Mail User's Guide."
