## Q50515: QuickC .FON Files Identical to Windows .FON Files, Not .FNT

	Article: Q50515
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 2.00 2.01
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | s_quickasm docerr QC | mspl13_c
	Last Modified: 17-JAN-1990
	
	Chapters 12-14 of the "C for Yourself" text is almost identical to
	Chapters 2-4 of the Version 2.00 "Microsoft QuickC Graphics Library
	Reference", but there is some conflicting information. In general, if
	there is a conflict of information, the graphics library reference is
	correct.
	
	On Page 265 of the "C for yourself" text and on Page 87 of the
	graphics library reference, the information on QuickC (QC) .FON font
	file compatibility is incorrect.
	
	QuickC's .FON files are identical to Windows .FON files, not .FNT
	files.
	
	This error in "C for yourself" is documented in the QuickC Version
	2.00 README.DOC file, Part 2, "Notes on 'C for Yourself.'"
