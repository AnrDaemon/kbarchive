	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you are using the Logitech mouse driver with Microsoft Windows, when you
	start Windows, about four garbled characters are sent through the COM1 port.
	
	This behavior is normal operation. The Logitech driver is searching for the
	presence of a Logitech mouse. The codes sent through the serial port are
	necessary to detect the mouse.
