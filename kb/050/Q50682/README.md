	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator 4.00, when using the Flight Instruction mode, during the
	Straight and Level lesson, the instructor says, "Fly heading 360, climb and
	maintain 1500 feet." He then says "You need a right climbing turn, hold heading
	360," but the right climbing turn has already been completed.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
