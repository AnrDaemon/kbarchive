	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you are using a Macintosh Portable as a server for Microsoft Mail and the
	machine goes into sleep mode, the server's ID on the network disappears.
	
	This problem causes users logged in to see the Give Up box and forces them to
	quit Mail by clicking the Give Up button.
	
	To correct this problem, turn off sleep mode when using the Portable as a server
	on the network, or use a different Macintosh as the server.
