	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Files placed in the Trash can still be enclosed in mail messages in Microsoft
	Mail version 2.00. Normally, opening an application empties the Trash, but since
	Mail is not an application, this is not the case.
	
	In Microsoft Mail version 3.00, the Trash is a dimmed file. This file and its
	contents cannot be included as enclosures.
