	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Microsoft Windows 3.0 and 3.1 File Manager Net Connection section can
	save previous server and sharename net connections. However, it does
	not save passwords that are required for the connection. This behavior
	is by design, to enhance network security. You must type the password
	each time the network connection is made.
	
	This information does not apply to later version of Windows.
