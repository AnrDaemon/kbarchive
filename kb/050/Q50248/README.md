	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When creating a custom form in Microsoft Mail, adding an image field allows
	users to paste a bitmapped graphic from the Clipboard (or Scrapbook) into the
	Send Screen of the form once the form is installed.
	
	If you add a bitmapped graphic to the Send Screen when the form is being created,
	use a graphic overlay to seal the image in the form.
	
	For more information on how to use image fields and graphic overlays, see the
	Appendix "Using Custom Forms in Microsoft Mail" in the "Microsoft Mail Network
	Manager's Guide."
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For example, you can incorporate a company logo in the Send Screen of a custom
	form by doing the following:
	
	1. Create the logo in a graphics application.
	
	2. Copy the logo to the Clipboard.
	
	3. When you are editing the Send Screen of the custom form, paste the graphic
	  anywhere in the Send Screen.
	
	4. Frame the imported logo with a graphic overlay. Once the form is installed,
	  the logo of the company will be displayed every time a user selects this form
	  to send a message.
