	The Control Panel sets up a timer to check the current time and date
	periodically. When the timer activates, it reads the system clock and
	updates its display. There is no guarantee that the timer will
	activate in 1-second increments or that it will be synchronized with
	the system clock. The Control Panel display is accurate plus or minus
	a few seconds.
