	In Microsoft Windows Write, when you press the PAGE DOWN key while the
	cursor is in the middle of a picture (not selected) and a picture is
	on the next screen, the display moves to the new screen and then moves
	back. The cursor does not move. Repeating this action does not move
	the cursor. Clicking below the control bar on the right side of the
	window works correctly.
