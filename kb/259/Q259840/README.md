	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To obtain Move Server Wizard from the Web:
	
	1. Navigate to the following Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/exchange (http://www.microsoft.com/exchange)
	
	2. Under Technical Information, click Deployment and Migration.
	
	3. Click Deployment & Migration Tools, and then click Microsoft Exchange
	  Move Server Wizard.
	
	4. This page describes Move Server Wizard, specifies the latest Exchange Server
	  service pack that Move Server Wizard is included in, and includes a link to
	  download that Exchange Server service pack. Click that link.
	
	5. Click the appropriate language.
	
	6. Click to download the "Server support files" that are appropriate for your
	  configuration. Those files contain Move Server Wizard.
	
	To obtain Move Server Wizard from an Exchange Server service pack CD-ROM,
	navigate to the <root>\<language>\Server\Support\Movesrvr folder,
	where <root> is the root directory and <language> is the appropriate
	language, for example:
	
	  D:\Eng\Server\Support\Movesrvr
	
	There are three significant Move Server Wizard releases:
	
	- The first release is post-Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1, and enables
	  Move Server Wizard to move any Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 computer.
	
	- A re-release of Move Server Wizard is included in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
	  Pack 2, and this release can move both Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 and
	  Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 computers.
	
	- Because of the changes to the database schema in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
	  Pack 3, a new release of Move Server Wizard is necessary for Service Pack 3.
	  The Service Pack 3 release can move Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3
	  computers.
	
	IMPORTANT: Microsoft strongly encourages you to read all of the documentation for
	Move Server Wizard before you begin the move process. The Move Server Wizard
	uses a process that includes pre-move and post-move tasks that you need to
	perform, and the process requires that you plan carefully. Move Server Wizard
	documentation is available in either Rich Text Format (RTF) or Hypertext Markup
	Language (HTML) format in the Movesrvr folder.
