	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft StarLancer, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the multiplayer games in Microsoft StarLancer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Cooperative Play Missions
	-------------------------
	
	Two or more pilots can join forces to play the single-player game missions in
	StarLancer.
	
	The game host can start a previously saved cooperative play game. The host can
	also start a previously saved single-player game, and then start a cooperative
	mission where the saved single-player mission ended.
	
	Death Match Scenarios
	---------------------
	
	Asteroid Field:
	
	A free-for-all or team death match set in a dense field of asteroids.
	
	Team play: The team with the most kills wins.
	
	Nuclear Threat:
	
	Similar to the Asteroid Field death match, with the addition of six beacons that
	are hidden in the field of asteroids. If a player collects all six beacons and
	then enters the beacon gate, they trigger a nuclear blast that kills all of the
	other players. If you destroy a player's ship, that player drops any beacons
	that they are carrying.
	
	Team play: None.
	
	Dark Reign:
	
	This death match takes place around an active Dark Reign tower. When a player
	picks up the Dark Reign Comms Relay powerup, the Dark Reign tower no longer
	fires on that player, and all kills made by the Dark Reign tower are added to
	that player's score. If the player that holds the Dark Reign Comms Relay powerup
	is killed, the Dark Reign Comms Relay powerup is randomly re-spawned among the
	other powerups in the game.
	
	Team play: The Dark Reign tower does not fire on members of the team that holds
	the Dark Reign Comms Relay powerup.
	
	Tag Bomb:
	
	A time bomb is installed in each player's ship. When a player is killed and then
	re-spawns, the bomb timer in their ship starts ticking. To make your bomb stop
	ticking, shoot or ram another player to make their bomb start ticking. If you
	shoot or ram another player to make their bomb start ticking, and that player is
	destroyed by their bomb, you receive credit for two kills instead of one.
	
	Team play: The team with the most kills wins.
	
	Hunt the Shadow:
	
	The first player to kill an opponent becomes the Shadow. The Shadow remains
	cloaked until killed, but has no shields and cannot pick up powerups. When
	another player kills the Shadow, they become the next Shadow, and they receive
	credit for five additional kills.
	
	Team play: The team with the most kills wins.
	
	Vampires:
	
	The first player killed in this match becomes a Vampire. When a Vampire kills an
	uninfected player, that player also becomes a Vampire. Vampires cannot pick up
	powerups. When only one human player is left in the game, the human player
	receives credit for five kills, all players are cured, and then the process
	starts over.
	
	Team play: None.
	
	Death Match Options
	-------------------
	
	When you host a multiplayer death match game, you can select or clear the
	following check boxes on the game configuration screen.
	
	AI Turrets:
	
	Laser turrets embedded within asteroids shoot at all players in the game. If a
	player shoots a turret, that turret no longer fires at that player.
	
	Target Players:
	
	Players can select each other as targets.
	
	Team Play:
	
	Enables team play in a death match game. For information about team objectives in
	death match games, please see the "Death Match Games" section of this article.
	
	NOTE: Team Play is only available for certain death match games.
