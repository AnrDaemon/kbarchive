	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you perform a directory import the following error message may be
	displayed:
	
	  Directory Import Complete
	  XX Warning events were encountered but not logged.
	  XX error descriptions were encountered in the system Application log.
	  The file c:\csvfilename.err contains copies of all object descriptions
	  containing errors.
	
	The Csvfilename.err contains information about the object that the error was
	generated by similar to the following:
	
	  Mailbox,,"Display Name","Last Name","First Name",","Alias Name","Directory
	  Name"...,Recipients
	
	The following event ID is logged in the application event log:
	
	  Event Type: Error
	  Event Source: MSExchangeDSImp
	  Event Category: None
	  Event ID: 291
	  Computer: Exchange_ServerName
	  Description:
	  Unable to create Mailbox Username because the required Home-Server
	  attribute was not specified.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue can occur because the import file needs the Home-Server column in the
	header to create a new mailbox. The default mode is update, which creates the
	object if it does not exist or modifies the object if it does exist.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, add the Home-Server column to the Header.csv file.
