	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you have a 2-tier client/server application (for example, a Visual Basic
	desktop client application that connects to SQL Server), should you apply for
	the Client Logo, Server Logo, or both?
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the client workstation manipulates the data and requires little involvement
	from the server, other than SQL Server and some SQL stored procedures, then the
	application is considered to be a "Desktop" or Windows 2000 Professional
	application.
	
	To qualify for the Server Logo, there needs to be a clear server-side aspect to
	the application; for example, an Active Server Page (ASP) that collects data
	from a Web-based form where data is sent from the client to be processed on the
	server.
