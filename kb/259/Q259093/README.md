	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	How much work is it to comply with the Application Specification for Windows
	2000?
	
	For developers who begin working toward meeting the Application Specification for
	Windows 2000 early in the development cycle, there is very little incremental
	work.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The reality is that you may have met many of the requirements already. Every
	application needs an install, for example. However, the Application
	Specification for Windows 2000 outlines how customers would best benefit from
	its implementation.
	
	For developers who are nearing the end of the product development cycle, it may
	require more effort to retrofit the application to comply. That is why Microsoft
	encourages developers to begin reviewing the Application Specification for
	Windows 2000 as soon as possible in the product cycle.
