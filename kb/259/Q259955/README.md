	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft StarLancer, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft StarLancer, your video adapter may not be detected as a
	Direct3D-compatible device. As a result, 3D Render Mode is configured to use the
	Software Renderer when you play the game.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if any of the following video adapters are installed in
	your computer:
	
	- Matrox MGA Mystique
	
	- Matrox Millennium II AGP PowerDesk
	
	- S3 ViRGE PCI 325
	
	These video adapters do not support all of the Direct3D features that are
	required by StarLancer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior has also been reported with video adapters based on the S3 ViRGE
	Vx/Dx/Gx chip sets.
