	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Unimodem V is the newest release of Unimodem, the Windows universal modem
	driver/telephony service provider for data/fax modems. Unimodem V provides the
	driver support that sits between telephony applications and voice modems and
	allows them to work together. This driver adds the most requested features to
	support data/fax/voice modems, including wave file playback and recording to and
	from the phone line, wave file playback and recording to and from the handset,
	and support for speakerphones, Caller ID, distinctive ringing, and call
	forwarding.
	
	Independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
	can include Unimodem V with voice modem hardware so that telephony applications
	can run on their hardware. Independent software vendors (ISVs) can include
	Unimodem V with telephony applications so that their applications can run on
	voice modems that may not already include Unimodem V. Users can use Unimodem V
	with a telephony application or a voice modem if neither includes Unimodem V.
