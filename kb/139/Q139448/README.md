	- MSPRESS Mastering Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3.0, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Attempting to play the tour video, a demo video, or an expert point of view
	video results in the following error message, and the video does not play:
	
	  Video for Windows is Not Installed
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This error message appears when the Video for Windows drivers cannot play the
	video file. The cause of this could be something other than not having Video for
	Windows installed on the system.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	1. Make sure you do have Video for Windows version 1.1 installed on your system
	  by running Setup.exe from the \Vfw directory on the Mastering Visual FoxPro
	  compact disc. The Setup program installs the latest version of Video for
	  Windows on your computer.
	
	2. If the problem still occurs, try playing a demo or expert point of view video
	  file directly from the Mastering Visual FoxPro compact disc. To do this,
	  start the Media Player program that is usually installed under Accessories,
	  and open one of the video files. The demo files are located in the
	  \Mvfp\Demos directory on the compact disc, and the expert point of view files
	  are in the \Mvfp\Pov directory.
	
	3. If the file can't be run under Media Player, you have a problem with Video
	  for Windows on your computer. If this is the case, Media Player should give
	  you a useful error message describing the cause of the problem.
	
	4. If you have installed Video for Windows from the Mastering Visual FoxPro
	  version 1.0 compact disc and are still experiencing the problem, use one of
	  the following support options to get more help:
	
	   - On CompuServe, type GO MSWIN95.
	
	   - On The Microsoft Network, go to the Microsoft Windows Forum.
	
	   - Call Microsoft Product Support Services at (425) 635-7040.
