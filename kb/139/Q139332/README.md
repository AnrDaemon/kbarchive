	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Applications can be scheduled to run at a predetermined day and time using the
	AT command. These applications can be run on the desktop by including
	/INTERACTIVE in the command line. Jobs may be scheduled to run in the background
	by omitting /INTERACTIVE in the command line. Omitting this switch has no effect
	in Windows NT 3.51.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
