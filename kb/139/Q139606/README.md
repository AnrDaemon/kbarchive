	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article gives you some tips you can use to improve the performance of the
	Mastering Visual FoxPro program.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following general tips can improve the performance of any Windows-based
	program or application.
	
	1. Close all applications and programs that you are not using.
	
	2. Add more RAM (memory) to your computer. If you do not have a least 8 MB of
	  memory, you will not be able to run Mastering Visual FoxPro until you add
	  more memory.
	
	3. Make sure you have a minimum of 5 MB free in Windows for best movie
	  performance. On the Help menu in Program Manager, click About Program Manager
	  to check the amount of free memory Windows has available.
	
	4. Under Windows version 3.1, make sure you have a permanent Windows swap file
	  on your hard disk. Look in Control Panel, 386 Enhanced for Virtual Memory
	  settings.
	
	5. Defragment your hard disk by running a defragmentation program such as
	  Microsoft Defrag, which comes with MS-DOS version 6 or later.
	
	6. If you are using more than 256 colors for your monitor display, you may want
	  to lower your video colors to 256.
	
	7. Add a cache to your CD-ROM drive.
	
	For complete details on improving performance, please consult your Windows and
	CD-ROM drive manuals. Also, please see the Readme.txt file included with
	Mastering Visual FoxPro for more information on improving performance.
