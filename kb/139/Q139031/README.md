	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Right-clicking the Project Workspace window displays a menu showing Title Tips
	as an option that can be toggled on or off. However, Title Tips are not
	documented or explained anywhere.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Title Tips cause the selected text to be completely displayed even if another
	window is overlapping that portion of the Project Workspace window. For example,
	the file list displays several files, but the last few letters of each file name
	are not shown because the Project window is too small. If Title Tips are enabled
	and a file name is selected, the entire file name is displayed by extending the
	name past the edge of the Project Workspace window.
