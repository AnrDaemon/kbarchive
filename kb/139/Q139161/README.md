	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Encarta World Atlas does not include the Help menu generally included
	with Windows applications.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This functionality and user interface is by design. Alternative Help methods are
	integrated into World Atlas allowing you to navigate with context explanations
	along the way.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	World Atlas uses an animated globe character named Cosmo to provide a Social
	User Interface. Cosmo guides you to successful completion of the particular task
	you have undertaken. Animation helps bring Cosmo to life.
	
	Cosmo's navigation structure engages you in dialog through a speech balloon. You
	select options listed in the balloon to learn how to accomplish tasks, or to get
	simple explanations of World Atlas features.
	
	Pop-up Help is also available if you turn off Cosmo. Pop-up Help starts when you
	move your mouse pointer over any control.
