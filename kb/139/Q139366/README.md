	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you have recorded and imported sounds in 3D Movie Maker, and if the sounds
	are not used in the current movie, 3D Movie Maker displays the following
	warning:
	
	  You recorded or imported sounds that you didn't use in your movie. Do you
	  want to: Get rid of them before closing the movie? Leave the unused sounds in
	  the file?
	
	If you opt to "Get rid of them before closing the movie," all of the recorded and
	imported sounds that you didn't use in the movie are removed from the 3D Movie
	Maker file. If you want to use them again, you'll need to either record the
	sounds again or import them in to 3D Movie Maker again.
	
	If you choose "Leave the unused sounds in the file," all of the sounds remain in
	the 3D Movie Maker (.3mm) file and are available for you to use the next time
	you edit the movie.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To make sure that you do not unintentionally lose the sounds that you created
	using 3D Movie Maker, record the sounds using Windows Sound Recorder. These
	files are saved as .wav files.
	
	Sound files are compressed when you import them into 3D Movie Maker. They are
	stored in a proprietary format that takes up less hard drive space than standard
	.wav files.
