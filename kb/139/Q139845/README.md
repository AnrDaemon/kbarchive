## Q139845: Long File Names Not Displayed During Compression

	Article: Q139845

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When the mini-Windows portion of Windows 95 is running while you compress a
	drive, the file names listed as being compressed use the standard 8.3 file name
	format, not the Windows 95 long file name format.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When mini-Windows is running, only standard 8.3 file names are recognized. It
	may appear that long file names are being damaged by the compression routine, as
	some of the file names are not recognizable. However, the compression routine
	does not damage the long file names; it merely displays the 8.3 versions of the
	long file names.
	
	If you compress a drive and mini-Windows is not required, files are displayed
	using the long file names.
