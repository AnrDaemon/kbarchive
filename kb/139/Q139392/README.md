	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The procedure offers improved performance, but requires a large amount of free
	hard drive space.
	
	Program              Required Drive Space
	-------              --------------------
	
	Bookshelf 1995       570 MB
	Encarta 1995         645 MB
	
	NOTE: You should only use this procedure on computers with large-capacity hard
	drives in situations where fast performance is critical.
	
	Installing The Compact Disc
	---------------------------
	
	To install the entire compact disk to your hard drive, do the following:
	
	1. Open the compact disc and double-click the Installer or Setup icon. This
	  places the program and system files onto your hard drive.
	
	2. When the installation completes, locate the Data folder on the compact disc
	  and copy the following data folders to your hard drive.
	
	  Product           Data Folders
	  --------          ------------
	
	  Bookshelf 1995    Books
	  Encarta 1995      Encarta Files
	
	3. Drag these folders directly to your hard drive. The copy process takes some
	  time. These folders must remain directly on the hard drive; they cannot be
	  placed within other folders.
	
	4. Rename your hard drive. Name the hard drive using the exact same name as the
	  program compact disc.
	
	The multimedia program now runs on your computer without requiring the compact
	disc.
