	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to run Setup for World Atlas, you may receive one of the
	following error messages:
	
	  Setup was unable to determine a valid default destination folder. Specify a
	  different destination folder.
	
	  There is not enough disk space to complete installation. You can change your
	  installation options, contine installation, or exit Setup.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Not enough free disk space is available on the Windows drive.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	For World Atlas 1996 make at least 7 megabytes (MB) and for World Atlas 1997
	make at least 1488 kilobytes (K) of disk space available on the drive where you
	installed Windows. Run Setup again.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Setup program checks the drive where Windows is installed and determines if
	there is sufficient free disk space.
	
	Although the program can be installed onto a drive other than the Windows drive,
	World Atlas must have a minimum free disk space on the Windows drive.
