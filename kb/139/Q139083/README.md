	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to play a sound clip on MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive
	the following error message:
	
	  Navigator not found
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You may receive the error message stated above if any one of the following
	conditions exists:
	
	- You are trying to play an incorrectly authored sound clip.
	
	- You are trying to play a sound clip when MSN is very busy.
	
	- You are trying to play a sound clip on a computer with mixed beta and release
	  version DLL files. You may have installed the released version of MSN over a
	  beta version, which may have left you with a mix of beta and release version
	  DLL files.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If the sound clip was incorrectly authored, we can fix it.
	
	If MSN is very busy when you try to play a sound clip, the only solution is to
	try to play the sound clip later.
	
	If you installed the released version of MSN over a beta version, perform a clean
	install of MSN. If the clean install does not solve the problem, call MSN Member
	Support with the following information:
	
	- Which sound clip were you trying to play?
	
	- Where is the sound clip located on MSN?
	
	- What was the time and date when you tried to play the sound clip?
