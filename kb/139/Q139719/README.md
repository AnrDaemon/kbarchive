	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are running Windows 95 with a 16-color palette, the "Science" and "60's
	USA" screen savers included with Microsoft Plus! do not work in normal or
	preview mode. When you use these screen savers, the "Rendering lens" message
	does not appear and the screen saver is not visible. However, when you interrupt
	the screen saver, the screen is redrawn as if the screen saver were running.
	
	The other screen savers included with Microsoft Plus! work normally in 16-color
	mode.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You are using a 16-color palette in Windows 95.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Configure Windows 95 to use 256 or more colors. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.
	
	2. On the Settings tab, change the Color Palette settings from 16 to 256 or
	  greater.
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Plus! version 1.0 for
	Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
