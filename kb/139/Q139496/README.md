	- The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you close a bulletin board (BBS) or newsgroup that contains a lot of
	messages, it may take from 30 seconds to several minutes for the BBS or
	newsgroup to close.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by the cache trimming method used by MSN, The Microsoft
	Network, for a BBS or newsgroup with more than 1000 messages.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you read a BBS or newsgroup frequently, you can work around this problem by
	marking messages in the BBS or newsgroup as read, which cuts down on the number
	of messages you see the next time you enter the BBS or newsgroup.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
