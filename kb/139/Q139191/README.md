	the lesson does not play.
	
	If no video is playing, clicking the Play Through Lesson rewinds the entire
	lesson video and begins playing the lesson from the first step, and plays all
	the videos in succession.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Play Through Lesson button either stops playing a video and rewinds it, or
	rewinds the entire lesson and begins video replay. The action taken is
	determined by the state the video is in when the Play Through Lesson is
	clicked.
	
	The Play Through Lesson button begins playing the first video of a lesson and
	goes through all the videos in the lesson only if no video is playing when you
	click it. Otherwise, it stops the currently playing video and rewinds it, and
	highlights the first step of the lesson.
