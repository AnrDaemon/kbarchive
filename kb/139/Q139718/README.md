	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the Show Window Contents While Dragging feature of Microsoft
	Plus!, resizing a program window may cause the window's contents to flicker.
	
	Resizing certain program windows, such as My Computer, Control Panel, and Windows
	Explorer, does not cause the flickering to occur.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The flickering usually occurs with programs that implement a windowed box with
	capabilities for editing text or graphics (sometimes referred to as an Edit
	box). The flickering is more noticeable with slower video cards.
	
	The following are examples of programs that use Edit-box-style windows:
	
	- System Agent
	
	- Notepad
	
	- WordPad
	
	- Paint
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Plus! version 1.0 for
	Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
