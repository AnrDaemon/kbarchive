	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the asterisk (*) wildcard character in an advanced search, the
	search process takes an extremely long time to complete.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Wildcard searches using the asterisk character are supported in many multimedia
	programs. However, if you type an asterisk followed by the text you are
	searching for, the search takes much longer because the query must search
	through hundreds of thousands of words to find the words ending with the text
	you specified.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid long waiting times for search results, enclose the text you are
	searching for in quotation marks, or use the following search operators:
	
	- And
	- Or
	- Not
	- Near
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you search for words that start with the text you enter, the search process
	is much faster.
	
	For detailed information on how to search for text or keywords, please see the
	Search topic in the program's online Help.
