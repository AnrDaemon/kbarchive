## Q139172: PRB: Win32api.hlp &amp; Autodemo Missing from VFP3 Floppy Version

{% raw %}

	Article: Q139172
	Product(s): Microsoft FoxPro
	Version(s): 3.00
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 19-AUG-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Neither the Win32api.hlp Help file or the Autodemo program are available on the
	Visual FoxPro Professional Edition disks. They are available only on the CD-ROM
	compact disc.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Consistent with other Microsoft products, the CD-ROM compact disc version of
	Visual FoxPro Professional offers added value to the purchaser in the form of
	additional programs or files. In this case, the additional files are the
	Win32api.hlp file and the Autodemo program.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To get these additional files, you need to purchase the CD-ROM compact disc
	version of Visual FoxPro Professional.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Win32api.hlp file is an online reference that documents the various
	functions and components of the Win32 API set. As this is only distributed on
	the compact disc, you will not be offered the choice of installing this file in
	either a first-time or maintenance mode installation when installing Visual
	FoxPro Professional from disks.
	
	The Autodemo program, also available on the compact disc, provides guided
	demonstrations of many of Microsoft's Developer Tools & Products, including
	FORTRAN and Visual C++. Autodemo is not installed from the compact disc unless
	explicitly requested.
