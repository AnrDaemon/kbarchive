	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The To Recipe section of Julia Child has two tabbed sections: Ingredients and
	Cookware. On the Ingredients tab, you can add recipe ingredients to the Shopping
	List by clicking Shopping List. However, on the Cookware tab, if you click
	Shopping List, the recipe ingredients are added to the list, but the Cookware is
	not.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Cookware information is not added to the Shopping List by design of the program.
	The Shopping List is designed to be accessed from the Ingredients tab and the
	Cookware tab, but clicking the Shopping List only adds Ingredients.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To add a Cookware item to the Shopping List, do the following:
	
	1. Go to the recipe and click Shopping List. This adds the recipe Ingredients to
	  the Shopping List and opens up the Shopping List.
	
	2. At the Shopping List window, click on Add Item.
	
	This opens a text box that allows you to enter cookware items and add them to
	that specific recipe, or add them to a Miscellaneous section in the Shopping
	List.
