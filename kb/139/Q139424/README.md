	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If QuickShelf is customized to show all books and use small toolbar buttons, the
	QuickShelf toolbar may overlap the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) toolbar,
	obscuring some or all of the MOM toolbar. This will occur only if the MOM
	toolbar is also customized to use small toolbar buttons.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Customize the QuickShelf toolbar to use either regular or large toolbar buttons,
	and then drag the toolbar to its desired location on the screen.
	
	To change the toolbar button size, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click the QuickShelf options button (downward-pointing arrow) at the far
	  right of QuickShelf.
	
	2. Click Customize.
	
	3. Click the View tab.
	
	4. Click either Regular Buttons or Large Buttons, and then click OK.
	
	The QuickShelf toolbar should now switch to larger buttons and may be dragged to
	its desired location on the screen.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf versions listed at the
	top of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
