	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print from one of the programs listed at the top of this article to a
	color printer, the highlighted jump text (hot text) does not print. This occurs
	with the Printer Setup color option turned on.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To print an article with hot text, do one of the following:
	
	- Change the printer settings to use the Black Text or Black and White settings
	  instead of the color settings.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Change the Jump Text color to a darker color. This may allow the text to
	  print.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you print to a color printer with a black printer cartridge installed in
	the printer but with the printer set for color, the colors needed to print are
	not available. No error message is generated. The hot text simply does not
	print. Changing the printer settings to correctly match the cartridge solves
	this problem.
	
	For information on how to change the hot text colors, see Help for your
	multimedia program.
