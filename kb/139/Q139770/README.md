	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After you start Windows 95, the first document you print may take noticeably
	longer than subsequent documents.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The first time you print a document in a Windows 95 session, the print spooler
	must be started. Starting the print spooler can take several seconds, depending
	on the system configuration and hardware. Subsequent print jobs are faster
	because the print spooler has already been started.
	
	Additional query words: slow delay
