	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Word
	version 6.0 for Apple Macintosh to send a document with a routing slip
	configured to cross the Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway more than one time,
	you will get the following error message:
	
	  Ambiguous address: more than one recipient matches the name or address
	  specified.
	
	NOTE: The message will cross the gateway once. However, when the recipient sends
	the document on to the next user, the error will appear.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The workaround is to select the All the Recipients at Once option or rebuild the
	routing slip.
	
	Also, later versions of Microsoft Word have corrected the problem.
