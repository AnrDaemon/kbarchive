	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to run one of the products listed above on a monitor that has a
	screen resolution of less than 640 x 480 pixels, the program doesn't display
	correctly.
	
	This is most apparent if you try to run Magic School Bus (MSB) Human Body on a
	computer with an Apple 12-inch RGB monitor that supports a maximum resolution of
	512 x 384. You are not able to see the entire program screen with monitors with
	less than a 640 x 480 resolution.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	There is no known workaround for this problem. MSB Human Body for the Macintosh
	does not run properly on any monitor that does not support a resolution of at
	least 640 x 480.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To determine your current video resolution, do the following:
	
	1. On the Apple Menu, select Control Panels.
	
	2. Open Monitors control panel.
	
	3. Click Options.
	
	4. Verify that a monitor setting of at least 640 x 480 is available and
	  selected.
	
	5. If a resolution of 640 x 480 is not available, contact the manufacturer of
	  your monitor or video card.
