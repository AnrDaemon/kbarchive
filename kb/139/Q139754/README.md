	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Moving the mouse to a corner of the screen may activate the screen saver in
	Windows 95. This may occur even if the specific screen saver you are using does
	not have a "hot corner" enabled or does not have a "hot corner" feature.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The screen savers included with Microsoft Plus! have "hot corner" settings that
	remain active even if you are not using the screen saver in which you enabled
	the "hot corner" setting.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To enable or disable the "hot corner" settings, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.
	
	2. Click the Screen Saver tab.
	
	3. In the Screen Saver box, click any Microsoft Plus! screen saver, and then
	  click Settings.
	
	4. On the General tab, enable or disable the "hot corner" feature by clicking
	  each corner, and then clicking Default, Now, or Never on the menu that
	  appears.
	
	5. Click OK, and then click OK.
	
	The "hot corner" settings you choose apply to all the Microsoft Plus! screen
	savers, as well as to other screen savers in Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you uninstall the Desktop Themes component of Microsoft Plus!, you may not be
	able to disable the screen saver "hot corners." To disable the "hot corners,"
	reinstall the Desktop Themes component, and then follow the steps in the
	"Resolution" section above.
