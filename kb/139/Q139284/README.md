	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the File, Settings, Tools, or Help menu in Microsoft Backup, the
	menu may appear for only a few seconds. If you do not click a command on the
	menu during this time, the menu may disappear.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if you insert an unsupported tape (such as a QIC- WIDE or
	Travan tape) in the tape drive. When an unsupported tape is in the drive, any
	menu that is open is not displayed again when the Backup window is refreshed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, remove the unsupported tape from the drive.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
