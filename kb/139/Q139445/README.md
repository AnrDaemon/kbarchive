	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft has added support for Infrared Data Association (IrDA) connectivity to
	Windows 95. The latest release of the Infrared (IR) Communications Driver for
	Windows 95 is version 2.0.
	
	Infrared (IR) communications, based on technology similar to that used in remote
	controls, offers a convenient and reliable way to connect to peripheral devices
	without cables. IrDA connectivity is designed to take advantage of mobile
	computing features already built into Windows 95 and supports Plug and Play.
	
	The Infrared Communications Driver version 2.0 is an optional component of the
	Windows 95 operating system. The Infrared Communications Driver supports
	hardware devices which enable networking and communications over infrared media.
	The hardware device can be an infrared port built into the platform or an
	infrared adapter connected to one of the platform's serial or parallel ports.
	
	Infrared devices and Infrared Communications Driver 2.0 provide the following
	benefits:
	
	- You can use wireless infrared links instead of serial and parallel cables.
	  For example, instead of using a serial or parallel cable, you can exchange
	  files between two computers that are equipped with an infrared device and
	  Infrared Communications Driver 2.0. You can also print to infrared-capable
	  printers without the need for cable.
	
	- With IrLan you can use wireless infrared links rather than network cable to
	  access your local area network (LAN). IrLan currently supports Access Point
	  Mode. Access Point Mode enables a computer with an IrDA adapter to attach to
	  a local area network through an access point device that acts as the network
	  adapter for the computer.
	
	  An access point device is hardware supporting both a LAN network interface
	  controller (NIC) and an infrared transceiver. For communication over the
	  infrared link, the access point device runs a protocol stack that conforms to
	  the IrDA standards and runs the IrLan protocol over the IrDA stack. The
	  access point device implements a network adapter for the client using
	  infrared as the bus for accessing the adapter.
	
	  Currently there are two companies building Access Points: Hewlett- Packard
	  (HP) and Extended System. Infrared Communications Driver 2.0 has been tested
	  on both access points.
	
	Infrared Communications Driver 2.0 supports infrared communications links running
	at speeds up to 115.2 Kbps.
