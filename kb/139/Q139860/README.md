	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The setting for the number of copies of a document to be printed from a program
	in Windows 95 overrides any similar setting that you make directly at the
	printer. Therefore, changing a setting on your printer to cause it to print
	multiple copies of a document generally results in only one copy being printed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior is by design to maintain a single source of control and prevent
	the printing of unwanted multiple copies of a document.
