	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can integrate 32-bit versions of Microsoft Bookshelf with 32-bit versions of
	Microsoft Word, and you can integrate 16-bit versions of Microsoft Bookshelf
	with 16-bit versions of Microsoft Word.
	
	You cannot integrate a 32-bit version of Microsoft Bookshelf with Microsoft Word
	for Windows NT, version 6.0, even though Word for Windows NT is a 32-bit version
	of Word.
	
	The 32-bit versions of Bookshelf are designed to integrate with the following
	versions of Word:
	
	- Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
	
	- Microsoft Word 97
	
	- Microsoft Word 2000
	
	NOTE: Bookshelf 95 is available in both 16-bit and 32-bit versions. To determine
	your version of Bookshelf 95, examine the upper left corner of the product box
	or the label on the Bookshelf 95 CD-ROM. If you see a "Microsoft Windows
	Compatible" logo, you have the 16-bit version of Bookshelf 95. If you see a
	"Designed for Microsoft Windows 95" logo, you have the 32-bit version of
	Bookshelf 95.
