	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Passport user security and privacy is extremely important. You must make all
	efforts to keep Passport user core profile data as secure and private as
	possible.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Review the following items to make sure that your site is following all Passport
	policies and standards:
	
	- Have you read, understood, and signed the comprehensive Microsoft privacy
	  policy?
	
	- Do you have a posted privacy statement?
	
	- If your site is based in the United States, is it registered with an
	  independent, industry-recognized, privacy-assurance body such as TRUSTe or
	  BBBOnLine?
	
	- Is your site constructed in such a way that all of Microsoft's privacy and
	  security policies are being followed?
	
	- Are pages of your site that access Passport user profile data using the POST
	  method rather than the GET method to transfer user profile data to other
	  pages?
	
	NOTE: This is especially important when data is transferred between a collecting
	form and the page that performs the upload by using the Profile property and the
	Commit and LogoTag2 methods.
