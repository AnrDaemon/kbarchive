	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Some versions of Netscape Navigator have an issue that causes cross-site sign-in
	or registration posts to fail when certain proxies are used.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	- In Microsoft Windows NT, Navigator 4.0 fails from non-Secure Sockets Layer
	  (SSL) to SSL and from SSL to SSL. Version 4.04 and later browsers do not have
	  this problem.
	
	- In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98, Navigator 3.04 fails from non-SSL to
	  SSL and from SSL to SSL. Version 4.0 and later browsers do not have this
	  problem.
	
	- Navigator 3 users are specifically blocked from using the Passport express
	  purchase service because their information cannot be kept secure if used
	  through a proxy.
