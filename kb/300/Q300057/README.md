	========
	
	You are not able to view the sample Passport Web site pages, or the Passport Web
	site pages do not work correctly after you install the Passport Software
	Development Kit (SDK).
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	1. Make sure that your server meets the hardware requirements and that your
	  server is running the correct software.
	
	For more information about server hardware and software requirements, see the
	following Microsoft Passport Web site:
	
	  Passport Developer Info
	  http://www.passport.com/DevInfo/Start_SysReq.asp
	
	2. Ensure that your Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) default Web
	  site is currently running and that you can view the default page of the
	  server wwwroot.
	
	3. Ensure that you choose a Passport SDK installation option that includes the
	  sample Web site pages. Options such as Production may not install the sample
	  sites.
