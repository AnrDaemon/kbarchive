	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The games listed above include an Error Reporting tool that you can use to
	report unrecoverable errors (for example, general protection faults or invalid
	page faults) to Microsoft over the Internet.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When an unrecoverable error occurs, you receive the following error message:
	
	  <Game> has encountered a problem and
	  needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.
	
	  If you were in the middle of something, the information you were working on
	  may be lost.
	
	  Please tell Microsoft about this problem.
	  We have created an error report that you can send to help us improve
	  <Game>. We will treat this report as confidential and anonymous.
	
	  To see what data this error report contains, click here.
	
	If you choose to send an error report, Microsoft will analyze the fault data and
	attempt to identify and correct the issues involved. At the time of reporting,
	the Error Reporting tool checks to see if the issue that you have encountered
	has already been fixed. While the tool checks, an Error Reporting dialog box
	opens that indicates that the tool is preparing an error report.
	
	If a patch or workaround exists for the specific issue that you reported, the
	Error Reporting tool directs you to the appropriate Web site, where you can
	download the patch or workaround. If you are not prompted to download a patch or
	workaround, and you need support for the issue that you reported, please browse
	to the following Microsoft Web site for support options:
	
	  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?PR=gms
	
	The Error Reporting tool provides a new dialog box for unrecoverable errors,
	which you can use to send an error report to Microsoft. You can also view the
	data that the report contains, choose not to send individual reports to
	Microsoft, or view the Microsoft data-collection policy for this tool. To view
	the data-collection policy, browse to the following Microsoft Web site:
