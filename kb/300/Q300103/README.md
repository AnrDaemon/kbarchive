	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to test the Passport sign-in and sign-out process
	when your site is in test mode.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If your site is in test mode and a user has chosen to save their Passport
	password, the Passport cookies that are written in the test site's domain are
	not deleted, and a sign-out check-mark image is not displayed on the Passport
	server logout page.
	
	When you test browser behavior with a test site installation, you may
	occasionally need to quit the browser to reproduce a new Passport sign-in.
