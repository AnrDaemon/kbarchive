	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Users may see secure and nonsecure mode dialog boxes when they sign in to
	Passport.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Many browsers have a default setting that warns users if they are changing
	between secure and nonsecure modes. This setting may display up to two dialog
	boxes during the sign-in process: the first indicates a switch to a secure
	connection, and the second indicates a switch back to a nonsecure connection.
	You may be able to turn off these messages by selecting In the future, do not
	show this warning in the dialog box.
	
	This is a browser behavior and cannot be defeated by Passport or any other code.
	Passport Web sites must inform users that this dialog box may appear, depending
	on their browsers and security settings.
