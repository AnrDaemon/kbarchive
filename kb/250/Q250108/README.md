	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Asheron's Call and log in to Zone.com, you may receive the
	following message:
	
	  Your Patron <character name> has been deleted from the game.
	
	In addition, your character is no longer bound to the Allegiance.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs if your character's Patron deletes his/her character.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When a character's Patron deletes his/her character, all Allegiance information
	is also deleted for that character's Vassals.
	
	If those Vassals have Vassals of their own, they automatically become Monarchs of
	their own Allegiance ranks.
	
	If a Monarch deletes his/her character in Asheron's Call, the entire Monarchy is
	dissolved.
