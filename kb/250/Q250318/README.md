	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows NT Explorer may generate a "The parameter is incorrect" error message
	when you attempt to view permissions on a folder after you use Cacls.exe with
	the /G switch to edit permissions.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Windows NT Explorer Access Control List (ACL) editor generates an error
	message if any generic permissions, such as GENERIC_READ, GENERIC_WRITE, or
	GENERIC_EXECUTE are also present when the GENERIC_ALL permission is set.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem.
	
	To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
	fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
	information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
	Wide Web:
	
	  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS
	
	NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
	be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
	update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
	
	The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
	attributes or later:
	
	  Date         Time     Size      File name    Platform

	  01/04/2000   07:55p   226,064   Netui1.dll   I386
	
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use the /P switch in place of the /G switch. This
	replaces the permissions, but removes any inherited permissions.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you are setting GENERIC_ALL access, the Windows NT Explorer ACL editor should
	determine whether GENERIC_READ, GENERIC_WRITE, or GENERIC_EXECUTE permissions
	are already present, and if so, turn off those bits.
