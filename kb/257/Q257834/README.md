	================
	
	Microsoft is no longer adding CardBus functionality to Windows 95. Devices that
	were introduced after October, 1996, may or may not work with Windows 95. If a
	device does not work because of a problem in Windows 95, we may consider fixing
	the problem until hotfix support for Windows 95 is no longer available. However,
	we will not make architectural changes or add functionality to make them work.
	This also applies to models introduced after October, 1996, of devices
	introduced before October, 1996.
