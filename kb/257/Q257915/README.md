	SYMPTOMS

	When you type in Field 2 on a notecard in Microsoft Encarta Research Organizer
	99, the text in the field may appear as asterisks.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if a newer version of the Riched32.dll file is installed
	on your computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, upgrade to Encarta Encyclopedia 2000.
	
	To work around this issue, extract a copy of the Riched32.dll file from the
	Microsoft Windows CD-ROM or installation disks to the Windows\System folder on
	your hard disk.
	
	NOTE: When you install an older version of the Riched32.dll file, you may cause
	problems with other programs that use the updated version of this file. If this
	is the case, restore the newer version of the Riched32.dll file, or reinstall
	the program that requires the newer version of the file.
