	The cover of this book states that the accompanying CD-ROM includes a trial
	version of Liquid Motion. The CD actually includes a Setup file that will
	redirect you to Shopnow.com. While the product was available, Shopnow.com would
	allow you to obtain a license that would allow you to download a "trial" version
	of Liquid Motion.
	
	You will no longer be able to download or install Liquid Motion from any
	location, as Microsoft has discontinued Liquid Motion entirely. For further
	information please see:
