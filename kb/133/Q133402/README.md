	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you add an anniversary to Microsoft Schedule+ and then download it to a
	Timex Data Link watch, the anniversary may appear, even though it is not
	scheduled to start for at least a year.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Timex Data Link watch does not distinguish years when it downloads
	anniversaries. Whenever the month and day of an anniversary approaches, the
	Timex Data Link watch will flag it as an upcoming anniversary. When they are
	displayed on the watch, anniversaries repeat annually.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Timex Data Link watch is manufactured by Timex, a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
