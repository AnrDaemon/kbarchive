	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If a font is not displayed correctly, or if a font file is not recognized as a
	valid font, the font may be damaged.
	
	If you determine that a font may be damaged, delete the font and then reinstall
	the font from your original Windows 95/98 CD-ROM or disks or the disks provided
	by the third-party font manufacturer.
	
	Windows 95/98 stores fonts in the Windows\Fonts folder. Printer fonts and some
	third party fonts, such as Adobe Type Manager fonts, may be installed to another
	folder. Please see your third-party software documentation to identify the
	folder where these fonts are installed.
