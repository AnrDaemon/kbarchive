	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to find addresses in Automap Streets.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The address databases and address finding routines used in Microsoft Automap
	Streets work best if use the following guidelines:
	
	1. Use numeric house numbers. For example, use "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue"
	  (without the quotation marks) instead of "Sixteen Hundred Pennsylvania
	  Avenue".
	
	2. Road names that are the same as a suffix, such as "Circle Drive" or "Court
	  Avenue" may not be correctly interpreted by the program.
	
	3. If Automap Streets does not find an address, shorten the address by entering
	  the street name only. For example, if no match is found for "2345 Someplace
	  Avenue Southwest" try "Someplace Avenue" or "Someplace".
	
	4. If a map has more than one road with the same name and one of the roads does
	  not have house number data, Automap may not find either street. Shorten the
	  address by removing the house number and try again.
	
	5. When you find the street you want, if you click in different points along the
	  street, the status bar at the bottom of the screen will show the closest
	  house numbers.
