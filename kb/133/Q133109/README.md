	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you start the 32-bit versions of Microsoft Mail and Schedule Plus from the
	Startup program group with Schedule Plus configured to Run Minimized, and return
	to the Windows NT desktop from a screen saver, Mail intermittently stops
	responding (hangs) for a short period of time.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To workaround this problem, disable the Run Minimized option for Schedule Plus
	program item properties, log off, and log back on as the same user.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
	3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
