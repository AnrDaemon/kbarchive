	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	What were known in earlier versions of PowerPoint as templates are called
	Presentation Designs in PowerPoint 97. These files have a .pot extension and are
	in the folder called:
	
	  Templates\Presentation Designs
	
	which is in the same folder as Microsoft Office.
	
	However, this folder is the only place in which these files are called
	Presentation Designs. Elsewhere in PowerPoint, the term Design Template is used,
	but it refers to the same thing. For example:
	
	- The icon used to apply Presentation Designs has a Tooltip that says Apply
	  Design Template.
	
	- There is an Apply Design command on the Format menu.
	
	- The dialog box where you select and preview Presentation Designs is entitled
	  Apply Design.
