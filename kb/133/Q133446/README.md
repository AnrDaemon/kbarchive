	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can use the Presentation Conference feature in Microsoft PowerPoint 97 to
	run a slide show from one computer that is in turn viewed on other computers
	running on a network. This means the presenter connects his/her computer to each
	participant's computer and runs a slide show on all of the computers at the same
	time.

	Supported Features
	------------------
	
	You can use many of the standard features of PowerPoint during a Presentation
	Conference. The following standard features are supported:
	
	- You can use effects like builds and transitions in your slide show.

	  You can use effects like blacking the screen or using the annotation tool to
	  underscore a particular point as well.
	
	- You can use Meeting Minder. This tool allows you to take notes or minutes
	  during the presentation conference, as well as assign action items to the
	  meeting participants.
	
	- You can make the most of using interactive hot spots to jump to specific
	  slides in your presentation.
