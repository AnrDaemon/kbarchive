	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you export a telephone number to the Timex Data Link watch through the
	Schedule+ interface, phone numbers with more than 12 characters are truncated
	from the right.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by product design.
	
	The Timex Data Link watch is designed to store telephone numbers with up to 12
	digits. This design supports most phone numbers that are entered; however, when
	you use an international prefix/country code at the beginning of the phone
	number, the length of the phone number increases and the number exported to the
	watch may be truncated starting from the right.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
