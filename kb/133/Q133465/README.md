	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some or all of the Wine Guide movie control buttons are missing. The control
	buttons are used to start, pause, forward and rewind a movie.
	
	The problem may occur after you have done both of the following:
	
	- Paused the movie using the COMMAND+PERIOD shortcut key combination.
	
	  -and-
	
	- Moved the movie dialog box to the right side of the monitor.
	
	  When you moved the movie dialog box, part of the movie may have been hidden
	  off the screen.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, close the movie dialog box, then reopen it. All the
	control buttons for the movie should appear.
