	- Microsoft Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Julia Child stops responding (hangs) if you remove the CD-ROM from the
	CD-ROM drive while the program is running. This can also cause general
	protection (GP) faults and low memory messages.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If the program stops responding, restart the computer by pressing and holding
	down the CTRL key and the ALT key while you press the DEL key (CTRL+ALT+DEL). If
	the computer still does not respond, turn off the power switch, wait a few
	seconds and turn the power on.
	
	To avoid these problems, do not remove the Julia Child CD-ROM while the program
	is running.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Most of the files used with Julia Child are very large because they contain
	video and audio data. To conserve hard disk space, video and audio data files
	usually are not copied to your hard drive and are accessed from the CD-ROM while
	the program is running.
	
	The following information is from the Julia Child Readme.wri file on the CD-ROM:
	
	  NOTE: Do not remove the Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs compact
	  disc from your CD-ROM drive while running Home Cooking with Master Chefs.
	  Removing the CD-ROM will cause errors and/or incorrect displays or
	  functionality.
