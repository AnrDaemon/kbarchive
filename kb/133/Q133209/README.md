## Q133209: Writer/Artist: Cannot Access Control Room on Macintosh

	Article: Q133209
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Kids Products
	Version(s): MACINTOSH:1.0,1.1,1.1a
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you press and hold down the COMMAND key and the SHIFT key while you press
	the A key (COMMAND+SHIFT+A) to access the Creative Writer or Fine Artist Control
	Room, either nothing happens, or Spike barks and asks if you want to quit the
	program.
	
	This behavior occurs when you have set your Keyboard Layout to Flemish, French,
	French (numerical) or Italian.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	COMMAND+SHIFT+A only works with the U.S. keyboard layout.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the U.S. keyboard layout. To change your keyboard layout, do the following:
	
	1. Save the document you are working on and exit the program.
	
	2. Access the Control Panels on the Apple Menu.
	
	3. Double-click the Keyboard Control Panel.
	
	4. In the Keyboard Layout section, click U.S.
	
	5. Restart Creative Writer or Fine Artist.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you are using the Flemish, French or French (numerical) Keyboard Layout, you
	can use another method to access the Control Panel. Make sure the Caps Lock is
	on, then press and hold down the COMMAND and SHIFT keys while you press the Q
	key (COMMAND+SHIFT+Q).
