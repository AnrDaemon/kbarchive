	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	During sign-up for The Microsoft Network, if you click Settings and
	then click Access Numbers, the Service Type box is unavailable and has
	The Microsoft Network selected. This occurs because sign-up can happen
	using only phone numbers for The Microsoft Network, not using phone
	numbers for Internet and The Microsoft Network. Therefore, during sign-up
	you are restricted to selecting The Microsoft Network service type.
	
	Note that this situation affects only the number used to accomplish
	sign-up and does not affect your access numbers for The Microsoft Network.
	When sign-up is finished, you can select either The Microsoft Network or
	Internet And The Microsoft Network.
