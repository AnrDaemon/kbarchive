	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Text may not display in Chef's Tips when you use ATI video drivers set to
	display at 65,000 or 16 million colors under Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Chef's Tips display white text on a black background. When the ATI video
	driver is set to 65,000 or 16 million colors, the black background shows. This
	behavior may occur in other programs when white text is displayed on a black
	background.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Julia Child: Home
	Cooking With Master Chefs version 1.0 for Windows. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
	becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	NOTE: Close open files and programs before you attempt these steps.
	
	To resolve this problem, change the color display to 256 colors using the
	following steps:
	
	1. Open the Control Panel, which is located in the Main program group.
	
	2. Click Display.
	
	3. In the Color Palette box, set colors to 256.
	
	4. Click the Test button to test the color setting before changing the system
	  settings.
	
	5. If the test is successful, click Restart Windows Now.
