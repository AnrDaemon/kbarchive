	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play a video clip in Microsoft Encarta '93, the video portion of the
	video clip does not play.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Video clips in Microsoft Encarta '93 are encoded in Video for Windows version
	1.0 format. In this format, the first key frame is frame 18. Video for Windows
	version 1.1, which is used in Windows 95, cannot read the initial frame and
	cannot play the video portion of the video clip.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, upgrade to Microsoft Encarta '94 or later.
