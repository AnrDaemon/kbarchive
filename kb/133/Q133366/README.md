	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you clear all notes in the Notes section, all buttons except Done are
	unavailable.
	
	Before you can type another note, you must click Done to return to a recipe, then
	click on Notes again. The problem also occurs when you click Remove Note when
	the Recipes box lists only one item.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To prevent this problem, do the following:
	
	1. Highlight the note text.
	
	2. Click Delete.
	
	This removes note text without deleting the recipe.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Notes are associated with or attached to recipes. Removing notes deletes recipes
	from the Recipes list. When all recipes have been removed from the list, notes
	cannot be entered because no recipes exist to with which to associate the notes.
	A recipe must be on the list before a note can be entered.
