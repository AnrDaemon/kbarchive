	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Where Are the Dictionary and Thesaurus?
	---------------------------------------
	
	Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 2002 and Microsoft Encarta Reference
	Library 2002 contain a built-in dictionary. To access the dictionary,
	double-click any word in an encyclopedia article. If a definition is found in
	the dictionary, it will be displayed.
	
	To access the dictionary directly, click Dictionary on the Tools menu.
	
	Thesaurus
	---------
	
	Encarta Reference Library also includes a thesaurus, which you can access in the
	same way as the dictionary. For words that appear in the thesaurus, both a
	dictionary and thesaurus entry will be displayed; otherwise, only the dictionary
	entry appears.
	
	NOTE: Encarta Encyclopedia Standard does not include a dictionary.
	
	Encarta World English Dictionary
	--------------------------------
	
	Encarta Reference Library 2002 users may access the Encarta World English
	Dictionary by using FactFinder. Factfinder is included with the Reference
	Library. Reference Library 2002 does not include the disc-based edition of
	Encarta World English Dictionary.
	
	The online edition of the Dictionary is also available directly at
	http://dictionary.msn.com (a CD-ROM-based edition is no longer produced).
	
	Microsoft FactFinder Replaces QuickShelf
	----------------------------------------
	
	Microsoft FactFinder, which is included with Encarta Reference Library, displays
	dictionary entries from the Encarta World English Dictionary Online Edition. For
	more information about FactFinder, please see Encarta Reference Library Help.
	
	FactFinder replaces the QuickShelf program of earlier versions of Encarta.
	FactFinder allows you to look up the definitions of words and concepts in your
	word processor. It also allows you to quickly locate other resources pertinent
	to a particular word or topic through your word processor or Web browser -- for
	example, stock investment charts, company information, and so forth.
	
	For example, in Microsoft Word, press ALT+click a particular word. FactFinder
	then looks up a definition on the Web.
	
	If you do not have an online connection open, you can look up words and topics
	through the Encarta Reference Library content.
	
	Virtual Flights Available on Encarta Reference Library DVD Edition Only
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Virtual Flights feature is not available on the CD-ROM edition of Encarta
	Reference Library 2002.
	
	If you want to use Virtual Flights, you have several options:
	
	- Return the CD-ROM edition of Encarta and purchase the DVD edition.
	
	- Install Encarta 2001 and run the Virtual Flights feature.
	
	- Upgrade to the DVD edition for a nominal fee by calling the Microsoft Order
	  Desk at the following toll-free number:
	
	  (800) 360-7561

	Where Is the Encarta World English Dictionary?
	----------------------------------------------
	
	The Encarta World English Dictionary is included with Reference Suite 2001, but
	is not included with Reference Library 2002. This also includes the
	comprehensive dictionary, book of quotations, almanac, QuickShelf, and Microsoft
	Office Define Shortcut menu and Lookup Reference command on the Tools menu.
	
	Most of the same content can be accessed through Microsoft FactFinder, which
	accesses the online edition of the Encarta World English Dictionary and other
	resources including Web site searches. FactFinder content only works through an
	Internet connection.
	
	Dictionary Pronunciations
	-------------------------
	
	Encarta World English Dictionary (EWED) pronunciations can be found online at:
	
	  http://dictionary.msn.com
	
	This site includes the same pronunciations as the original EWED software.
	
	Pronunciations are a feature of Microsoft Encarta World English Dictionary. While
	EWED was included in Encarta Reference Suite 2001, it is not included in
	Reference Library 2002 as it is not produced in software form for this version.
	The dictionary accessed from the Tools menu in Reference Library 2002, does not
	provide pronunciations.
	
	To provide dictionary pronunciations, you can reinstall your EWED software and
	use it as a supplement to Reference Library 2002.
