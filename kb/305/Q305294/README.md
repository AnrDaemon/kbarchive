	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you switch between two 3D Virtual Tours that are loading, Encarta may stop
	responding (hang).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you are using assigned buttons on a Microsoft
	IntelliPoint mouse to go forward and backward between the two loading tours.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, do not use the mouse to switch between the two tours.
	Use the following keyboard strokes to switch between the two tours:
	
	  ALT+LEFT ARROW
	  ALT+RIGHT ARROW
