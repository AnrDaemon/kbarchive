	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the mouse pointer to navigate through the multimedia section of any
	of the Microsoft Encarta programs listed at the beginning of this article, you
	can double-click a word to open a dictionary window, which provides the
	definition of that word, or the closest word that the dictionary contains.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	By design, Encarta allows you to double-click any given word as a method of
	bringing up the dictionary. Normally, there are restrictions to this
	functionality (to prevent the dictionary from opening when you double-click
	within restricted areas): within photo credits, captions, and titles. However,
	these restrictions do not apply in the programs listed at the beginning of this
	article. Therefore, if you double-click within a photo credit, caption, or
	title, the dictionary unexpectedly opens.
	
	In some situations, if you click a caption after you click someplace in the text
	of the multimedia items description, the dictionary opens to the last cursor
	position within the items description. For example, this behavior may occur if
	you perform the following procedure:
	
	1. Open a picture or an item that includes a description in the caption.
	
	2. Click anywhere in the description.
	
	3. Double-click Credits.
	
	  The dictionary opens in the description of the item that you previously
	  clicked.
