	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	While you load a 3D Virtual Tour in either of the Microsoft Encarta programs
	listed at the beginning of this article, your computer's CPU-usage level is
	indicated to be at 100 percent. If you shift focus to another part of Encarta
	during this loading process, the CPU-usage level remains at 100 percent.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior is by design. The process of loading 3D Virtual Tours requires 100
	percent of your computer's available CPU resources. Normal CPU resources return
	as soon as the tour is finished loading.
