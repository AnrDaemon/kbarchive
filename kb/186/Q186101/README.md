	========
	
	During an FTP file transfer using either the Get or Put command, FTP clients do
	not show the correct file transfer size for files larger than 4 GB, although the

	This is by design. FTP clients use an unsigned long data type to store the bytes
	transfer parameter. As a result, it is limited to 4 GB in size.
