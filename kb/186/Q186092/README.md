	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Encarta Virtual Globe 98, the screen may turn black or be
	distorted.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, reduce the Hardware Acceleration setting. To do so,
	follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click System.
	
	3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.
	
	4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of
	  None (the Basic Acceleration setting).
	
	5. Click OK, and then click Close.
	
	6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.
	
	If the issue continues to occur, start Windows without loading any
	terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or device drivers (this is called a
	clean boot). To do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. Restart the computer. When the "Starting Windows 95" message appears, press
	  and hold down the SHIFT key until Windows finishes loading.
	
	2. Disable any anti-virus or disk utility programs installed on the computer.
	  For information about how to disable these programs, consult the program's
	  documentation or manufacturer.
	
	3. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.
	
	4. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or
	  Systray, and then click End Task.
	
	  NOTE: Do not close Explorer or Systray.
	
	5. If a dialog box appears notifying you that the program is not responding,
	  click End Task.
	
	6. Repeat steps 2-4 for each program you want to quit.
