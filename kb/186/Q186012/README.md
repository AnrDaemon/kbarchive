	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article is a pointer to a white paper available for download. The white
	paper titled "Creating Certificate Hierarchies with Microsoft Certificate Server
	Version 1.0" describes how to use Microsoft Certificate Server version 1.0 and
	certification authority hierarchies with Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
	Service Pack 1.
	
	As noted in the Microsoft Windows NT Option Pack release notes, Microsoft
	Certificate Server 1.0 does not officially support certification authority
	hierarchies. However, several of the key capabilities of a certification
	authority hierarchies feature do work and can reasonably be used in an
	implementation with Exchange Server to achieve most of the desirable
	characteristics of certification authority hierarchies.
