	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a document in Microsoft Word 97, no formatting is displayed, and
	square boxes and symbols may be interspersed throughout the document's text.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when the Files Of Type setting (on the File menu, click
	Open) is "Recover Text from Any File," so that when you open your document, only
	the text is recovered, not any of its formatting.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To prevent only text from being recovered when you open your files and to open
	your documents in the format of Word documents, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the File menu, click Open.
	
	2. In the Files Of Type list, click Word Documents, or click All Files.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The "Recover Text from Any File" setting will remain until you change it back to
	either Word Documents or to All Files.
