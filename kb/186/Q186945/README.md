	language arguments with the date picker. The same procedure can be used to
	calculate meeting requests and tasks dates as well.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you set up an appointment or task, it is sometimes necessary to calculate a
	date in the future for an appointment or for a task. For example, to create an
	appointment 15 days from today's date, perform the following steps:
	
	1. Click on the New Appointment button to open an appointment window.
	
	2. In the Start Time dialog box, type "15 days" (without the quotation marks) in
	  the date field and hit Enter.
	
	3. The start date will now show the date 15 days from today's date.
	
	This will also work for days other than today's date if you choose that date from
	the date picker first, and then create a new appointment typing in a valid date
	argument. Outlook will calculate the appropriate date.
	
	Valid arguments that can be used are days, months, and years.
	
	The same procedure can be used with the Meeting Request form and the Task form.
