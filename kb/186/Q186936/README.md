	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook Web Access Service Pack 1 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When you enter a Universal Resource Locator (URL) in a Contact or in an
	Appointment in the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, the URL does not become a
	hyperlink that you can click to jump to the address. Hyperlinks are not
	available when you create a Contact or Appointment in the OWA client.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you need to open a URL entered into a Contact or Appointment from the Outlook
	Web Access client, copy the URL and paste it into the address field of a browser
	window to activate the link.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In the Outlook client you can enter a URL inside a Contact or Appointment to
	create a hyperlink; however, OWA does not currently support this feature. All
	normal messages you send in the OWA client will allow you to enter a URL as a
	hyperlink.
