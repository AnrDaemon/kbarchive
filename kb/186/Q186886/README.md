	When you tally the responses from the attendees of a recurring meeting using
	Outlook Web Access Calendaring, the tally adds all the accepted responses until
	a declined response is opened. If a user creates a meeting request using Outlook
	Web Access, the tally may appear incorrect if one of the users declines one of
	the occurrences of the meeting.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access,
	version 5.5.
