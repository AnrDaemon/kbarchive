	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a Word 97 document containing bullets and/or numbers that you
	saved in the WordPerfect 5.x for Windows format, the bullets and numbers are not
	retained.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs if Microsoft FrontPage 98 is installed on the same computer
	as Microsoft Word 97.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, upgrade to Microsoft Word 97 for Windows Service
	Release 1 (SR-1).
	
	You can work around this problem without upgrading to Microsoft Word Service
	Release 1 (SR-1). To do this, perform a custom installation of FrontPage 98 and
	do not do not install the Proofing Tools and Converters (in the Components
	section).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97
	Service Release 1 (SR-1).
