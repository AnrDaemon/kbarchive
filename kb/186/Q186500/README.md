	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The APPSEC command runs Application Security. The Application Security tool
	allows administrators to specify exactly which applications clients can run.
	This is similar to the policy restriction "Allow to Run." This application
	provides excellent control over what executables can be launched. However, the
	disadvantage is that EVERY executable must be specified. Some applications may
	use dozens of separate executables, and they must all be registered if this
	utility is enabled.
