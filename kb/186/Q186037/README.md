	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft proofing tools packages are available from Alki Software for languages
	from six different language groups: Western European, Central European, Baltic,
	Cyrillic, Greek, and Turkish.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Each language group uses its own set of characters. By default, you can proof
	text in any of the languages within your system's language group. For example,
	if you are using the English (U.S.) version of Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft
	Windows 98, Microsoft Windows NT, or Microsoft Windows 2000, you should have no
	problem proofing text in other Western European languages. However, if you want
	to proof text in a different language group, you may need to adjust your
	operating system to turn on (enable) your applications to display and proof text
	correctly in the new language.
	
	For additional information about how to turn on support for multiple languages in
	Windows, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q141306 How to Enable Support for Multiple Languages in Windows
	
	
	  Q177561 How to Add and Enable Additional Languages in Windows NT
	
	
	NOTE: The spelling check feature does not work in Office 97 applications, other
	than Word 97 for Windows, in languages outside your Windows 95 operating
	system's language group. You must upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 or later. Please
	contact Alki Software for more information.
	
	The following table lists the language groups and languages for use with Office
	97, and which proofing tools are included in each package.
	
	NOTE: Some proofing tools are not available for all languages.
