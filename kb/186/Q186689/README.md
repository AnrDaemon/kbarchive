	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you compose a new appointment or meeting request in a calendar that is
	located in a public folder, if you check the option for a reminder, a reminder
	is not generated. Instead, the following message is displayed:
	
	  The reminder for XXX's appointment will not appear because the item is
	  not in your calendar or tasks folder. Is this OK?
	
	The reminder does not notify you of the meeting or appointment.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Because public folders are not specific to any one user or profile, there is no
	one for the reminder to remind. To receive reminders to specific appointments or
	meetings, use your mailbox calendar to make appointments and schedule meetings.
