	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the Outlook Web Access client, if you paste a very large
	message into the Text area of the Out of Office dialog box, the computer may
	stop responding. Eventually, a blank window appears. If you try to close the
	window by clicking the X in the upper-right corner of the window, the window
	will close, but none of the other functions of the client, such as viewing
	messages, will work.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, do not paste a large amount of message text into
	your Out of Office text box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Your pointer will display an hourglass shape, which will eventually turn into a
	blank window, or if you add a large Out of Office text, a message will appear
	that says the operation timed out. You may also see a script timeout message.
