	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click Start and then click Run, Windows NT Server 4.0 remembers the
	last command that was entered. Terminal Server 4.0 does not.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design. If commands were remembered, the same command would
	be remembered for all users.
