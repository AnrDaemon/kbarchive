	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When you use the Outlook HTML Forms Converter to convert a form that has multiple
	custom page names, the page names are converted to numbers.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Pages are converted sequentially and numbered thusly during the conversion
	process. Therefore, pages that may have been named in an Outlook form will only
	have numbers for the various pages.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the above listed versions. New
	information will be posted here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
