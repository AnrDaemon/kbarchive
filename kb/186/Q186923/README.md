	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to send a message using the Outlook Web Access client the
	following may occur. After you compose a new message to a recipient who does not
	exist in the global address book, and then use Check Name to attempt to resolve
	the name, the name cannot be resolved. If you remove the invalid name from the
	TO: line and attempt to send the message, the following error occurs:
	
	  Failed to Send message
	
	After you click OK, the following error message is displayed:
	
	  You must enter at least one name in the To, Cc, or Bcc box
	
	This error is expected. However, the "failed to send message" is not, because the
	message should not be attempted to be sent.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
