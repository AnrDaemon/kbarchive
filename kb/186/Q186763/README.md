	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open an HTML file in Microsoft Word 97, Word displays undesired marks
	throughout the document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if an HTML tag contains a punctuation mark, such as a colon.
	The Word 97 HTML converter interprets a punctuation mark as illegal HTML
	information and uses an undesired character in place of the punctuation mark.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97
	Service Release 2 (SR-2).
	
	For additional information about SR-2, please see the following article in the
