## Q35230: CPANEL Defaults to Display Page 0

	Article: Q35230
	Product(s): See article

	CPANEL may not display in a graphics application that uses graphics
	pages greater than 0. CPANEL defaults to display on Page 0 of the
	graphics page.
	
	To work around this problem, use the /S switch to the mouse driver.
