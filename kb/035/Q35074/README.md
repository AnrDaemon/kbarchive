	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The runway at the Livermore, CA, airport (in the San Francisco area) appears on
	color monitors as blue, instead of the normal black or gray. When attempting to
	land at this airport, the "Splash" message will appear on the screen, and the
	user mode is reset.
	
	To work around this problem, set the time to dusk. The Livermore airport will
	then appear black allowing you to land.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator Versions 3.00
	and 4.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as
	it becomes available.
