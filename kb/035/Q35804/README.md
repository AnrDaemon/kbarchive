	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On page 89, section 5.1.4, of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.1 Programmer's
	Guide", the last line of the second paragraph states "Name will be ignored if
	given with small or compact models." However, if a name is given in small or
	compact memory models the following error is generated by MASM 5.1 and 5.1a:
	
	  error A2063: Operand combination illegal
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Removing the name from the .CODE directive will allow you to assemble in small
	and compact memory models.
