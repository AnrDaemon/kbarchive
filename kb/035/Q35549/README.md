	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When using Flight Simulator's World War I Ace mode, there are six enemy fighters
	that stand ready to protect the enemy fuel depots and factories. If, after
	shooting down all six enemy planes, you want to have more enemy planes appear,
	you must fly over the river and back into friendly territory, then fly back into
	enemy territory. Six new enemy planes will appear.
	
	Flying back over friendly territory does not repair damage or refuel your plane,
	so if you want to refuel or be repaired, you must land before reentering enemy
	territory. Also, Friendly Base 2 has fuel only, so any time you need more bombs
	you must return to Friendly Base 1.
