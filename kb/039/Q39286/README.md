	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The PC client of Microsoft Mail does not support the translation of extended
	characters between the PC and Macintosh environments. Any characters entered
	into a Mail message from a PC client using the ALT key and the numeric keypad
	(for entering characters from the character set that have ASCII values greater
	than 126) might be displayed as different characters on the Macintosh; likewise,
	extended characters on the Macintosh might be displayed differently on the PC.
