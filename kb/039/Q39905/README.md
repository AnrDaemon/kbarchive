	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot import bitmap images into Micrografx Draw from any Microsoft Windows
	application because Draw does not recognize standard bitmapped images. Draw
	requires its own bitmap format.
	
	You can, however, incorporate Draw graphics into Windows applications by cutting
	and pasting from the Windows Clipboard.
