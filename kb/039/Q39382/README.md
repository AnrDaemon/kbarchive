	The QuickBASIC Version 4.50 editor will not allow you to insert the
	escape key code (ASCII 27) into a BASIC program by pressing CTRL+P
	followed by either ESC or CTRL+[.
	
	Note: QB.EXE Versions 4.00 and 4.00b do allow you to type a CTRL+P
	followed by either ESC or CTRL+[ and thereby insert a CHR$(27) byte
	into either a REMark or a quoted string.
