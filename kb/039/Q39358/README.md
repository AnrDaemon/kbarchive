	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When flying in areas provided on additional scenery disks (supplied by SubLOGIC
	Corporation), NDB (Non-Directional Beacon) navigation does not function. The
	needle on the ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) bearing indicator will ignore the
	position of the nondirectional beacon when tuned to a local NDB frequency.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 3.00. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information as it becomes available.
