	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If the access number you are using for MSN dial-up is incorrect for any reason,
	you can select a new dial-up number or "repoptimize" your MSN settings.
	
	To reset an access number with MSN versions 5.1, 5.3, or 5.6
	
	1. Start MSN.
	
	2. From the Sign In screen, click the Configure button.
	
	3. From the Change Internet Connection screen select the connection location,
	  and then click Modify.
	
	4. Type the area code and first three digits of your phone number in the boxes.
	  Note: Make sure all dialing options (dialing a number for an outside line,
	  etc.) are configured properly.
	
	5. From the Modem Properties screen, click the Advanced button
	
	6. Click the Reset button to reset the access numbers.
	
	To reset an access number with MSN versions 6.0, 6.1, and 7.0 (MSN Explorer)
	
	1. Start MSN Explorer.
	
	2. In the upper-right corner of the "Welcome" screen, click Connection Settings.
	
	3. Click Change the location you are dialing from, and then click Continue.
	
	4. Click Search for a new access number, type your telephone number in the boxes
	  provided, and then click Continue.
	  MSN Explorer will now dial a toll-free number to search for local access
	  numbers. If successful, a list of numbers will be displayed.
	
	5. Click Search for a new access number, type your telephone number in the boxes
	  provided, and then click Continue.
	  MSN Explorer will now dial a toll-free number to search for local access
	  numbers. If successful, a list of numbers will display.
	
	6. Select the Use box beside each access number you want to use.
	  If you are unsure about which numbers are local, contact your local telephone
	  company to avoid being charged long-distance fees. Also be sure select
	  dialing options as appropriate (dialing 1, dialing the area code) for each
	  number being used in the list.
	
	7. Click Continue.
