	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft has available three software development kits (SDKs) for Microsoft
	Mail for AppleTalk Networks.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following is a description of each SDK:
	
	Gateways SDK
	------------
	
	The Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit for Gateways provides a comprehensive
	set of tools for building gateways between AppleTalk Mail and other mail
	systems. A well-defined set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allows
	developers to tightly integrate the gateways with Microsoft Mail in order to
	have the same high level of performance, transparency, and reliability as
	AppleTalk Mail.
	
	NOTE: This SDK comes as a set of C and Pascal libraries that can be used with the
	Macintosh Programmers Workshop.
	
	Applications SDK
	----------------
	
	The Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit for Applications allows application
	vendors to tightly integrate their existing applications with AppleTalk Mail so
	users can send and receive messages and fully formatted files from within these
	applications. In addition, the Applications SDK lets an application use
	Microsoft Mail as a mechanism for interapplication communication, allowing
	developers to build powerful, distributed applications that can automatically
	consolidate, distribute, and manipulate information across a network.
	
	NOTE: This SDK comes as a set of C libraries that can be used with the Macintosh
	Programmers Workshop.
	
	SDK for HyperCard
	-----------------
	
	The Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit for HyperCard provides a set of
	HyperCard extensions that allow AppleTalk Mail to be accessed from within
	HyperCard. As a result, HyperCard developers can build powerful applications
	that use Microsoft Mail to exchange information both between users and between
	applications.
	
	NOTE: This SDK is included with the Mail version 3.00 server on the Extras disk.
