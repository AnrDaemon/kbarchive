	In the "Microsoft C Run-Time Library Reference," Page 634, there is a
	missing semicolon (;) in the sample function called average(). Add a
	semicolon at the end of the for-loop and the sample program will work
	properly.
	
	Note: There are two average() functions on Page 634, both need a
	semicolon at the end of the for-loop.
