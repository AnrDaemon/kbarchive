	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When there is only 5K of memory left in a Microsoft Mail client workstation and
	a message arrives, the Notifier window does not appear. The chime still rings,
	announcing that new mail has arrived, but Mail does not attempt to draw the
	Notifier window because there is so little memory left.
	
	This is a feature of the program. Freeing up more memory alleviates this
	situation.
