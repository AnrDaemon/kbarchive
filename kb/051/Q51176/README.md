	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If a user is removed from the server while he or she is still logged in,
	Microsoft Mail allows the logged-in user to create messages but not to send
	them.
	
	This is a feature of the current server-validation system. In the small number of
	cases in which a user is logged in and then gets deleted, Mail keeps that
	invalid user from sending or receiving messages.
