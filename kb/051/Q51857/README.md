	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator Version 4.00, when random weather is enabled, the values for
	wind speed and direction are at some initial number. After resetting the current
	mode by pressing PRINT SCREEN or by crashing the plane on takeoff, the wind
	speed and direction values are corrupted to zeros.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
