	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Mail Notifier window has two option buttons: "Read Now" and "Read
	Later." If you select the Read Later option while in a Microsoft Works version
	2.00 Help file, a system crash occurs. If you are using MultiFinder, the error
	message "Works has unexpectedly quit" is generated.
	
	This problem occurs because Works cannot correctly handle the transition from a
	Mail Notifier window back to the Works Help file window.
	
	To avoid this problem, select the Read Now option or turn off the Notifier
	window.
