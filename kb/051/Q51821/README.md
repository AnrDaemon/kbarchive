	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Slip lesson (under Option
	W, See more lessons) in Flight Instruction mode, the instructor calls attention
	to the cross controls, but the aileron and rudder always move in tandem. Also,
	the rudder indicator remains in the incorrect position after touchdown.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
