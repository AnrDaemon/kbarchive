	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail, the standard Inquiry message type does not have the options
	to send the message as Urgent or with a Return Receipt.
	
	However, the form can be modified with the Form Designer to include these
	options.
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
	release.
