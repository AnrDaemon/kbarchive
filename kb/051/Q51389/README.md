	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail, if you click the Form Mover button (after opening up a sample
	form) and the Form Designer is not present on your machine, the following
	message will appear:
	
	  Can't Understand Arguments to Command Put.
	
	This message appears if you click Cancel in response to the dialog box that pops
	up asking you to locate the Form Designer. Clicking Cancel again (the only
	option) causes a blank Form Designer screen to appear. Installing the Forms
	Designer and starting the process over will alleviate this problem.
