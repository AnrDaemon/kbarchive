	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The distinctive feature of radio buttons in Microsoft Mail is that only one in a
	group can be selected. In the Form Designer, you create a group of radio buttons
	with the Group Button on the New Button sample card.
	
	NOTE: You can have at least two radio buttons collected together by a single
	Group Button, and up to three Group Buttons on a single form.
	
	After selecting the Group Button and returning to the Send Screen template, drag
	the outline of the button over the radio buttons.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To display the radio buttons, do the following:
	
	1. Select the Group Button.
	
	2. From the Objects menu, choose Send Farther. Each time you choose the command,
	  the next button behind the Group appears.
	
	3. Repeat choosing Send Farther until all the radio buttons are displayed.
	
	You can also send the Group Button directly to the back of the card, behind all
	the other objects, by pressing COMMAND+SHIFT+HYPHEN (-).
	
	After radio buttons are grouped, you can select only one in that group. Clicking
	a radio button selects it, and the previously selected button in that group is
	no longer selected.
