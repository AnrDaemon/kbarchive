	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to install the Microsoft Mail Fax printer driver within the
	Windows NT Control Panel, this error may occur:
	
	  Could not find Setup File <path> PRINTER.INF
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows NT does not use the OEMSETUP.INF file like other versions of Windows.
	Windows NT looks for a PRINTER.INF file, which is not on the installation disk.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0a of the Microsoft
	Mail Gateway to Fax and Microsoft Windows NT. We are researching this problem
	and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
