	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The title bar of a window changes color to show whether or not it is currently
	selected or active. In Dinosaurs, the title bar of an active window has a
	granite pattern in dark tan or brown, while the title bar of an inactive window
	has a granite pattern in pale tan. Occasionally, however, an inactive window may
	have an active title bar, and vice-versa.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dinosaurs version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
