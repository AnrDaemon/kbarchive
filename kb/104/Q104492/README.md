	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Draw version 1.0 in Windows NT, both the 47-color
	(47COLORS.PAL) and 86-color (87COLORS.PAL) palettes may blank out after you try
	to scroll the line or fill bars at the bottom of the screen.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To redisplay the colors, click the individual color locations on the blank
	scroll bars, or do the following:
	
	1. From the Draw menu, choose Colors.
	
	2. Select Edit Palette, and then choose OK.
	
	The colors will return in the currently scrolled position.
	
	NOTE: Once the bars are scrolled again (either direction) the colors will
	disappear again.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and
	Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will
	post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
