	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some of the keyboard equivalents listed on page 33 of the Help topic "Using Rite
	Glossary" are incorrect. Page 33 includes the following:
	
	  Glossary window
	  Down arrow key or page down key = Open glossary list
	
	This is incorrect. To pull down the glossary list, you must press either ALT+T or
	ALT+DOWN ARROW.
	
	NOTE: You must already be in the Rite Glossary dialog box for these key
	combinations to work.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Help file for Stravinsky
	version 1.0.
