	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	ALT+T is a hotkey you can use in the Find dialog box to type the name of the
	item for which you want to search. If you press ALT+T while you are
	simultaneously scrolling down with the mouse in the Find dialog box, the list
	will continue to scroll down by itself until it reaches the last entry
	("zustand" in Schubert, "zoo" in Stravinsky and "writers" in Mozart), or you
	click an item with your mouse, or you close the dialog box.
	
	After this, in Stravinsky and Mozart, if you move the mouse pointer over the
	items in the list, they will each become highlighted as the pointer passes over
	them. In other words, pressing ALT+T while scrolling with the mouse makes the
	Find dialog box subsequently behave as though you were pressing the mouse button
	all the time.
	
	Closing and reopening the Find dialog box returns the mouse pointer behavior to
	normal.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Stravinsky and Mozart version
	1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
