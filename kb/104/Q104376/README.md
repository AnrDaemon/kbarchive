	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You can run a slide show in Dinosaurs that randomly displays different screens
	and parts of the program. To start a slide show, click Options and then click
	Slide Show. To stop a slide show, click anywhere on the Dinosaurs window.
	
	The slide show may take several seconds to start. Also, there is no indicator on
	the screen identifying when you are in a slide show and when you are not. The
	screens look exactly the same as they do when you page manually through the
	Dinosaurs application.
	
	If you have started a slide show, be aware that it may take several seconds to
	start and to change slides. Don't click the mouse unless you want to stop the
	slide show.
