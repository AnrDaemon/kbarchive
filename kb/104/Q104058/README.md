	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	With versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, if a user has an
	appointment that is both private and tentative, the appointment date on the
	calendar is bold when you view the calendar by choosing Open Other's Appt. Book
	from the File menu.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
	Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If an appointment is both private and tentative, you cannot see the appointment
	listed in the appointment view list; therefore, the appointment should not
	appear bold on the calendar when you view it.
	
	Private appointments appear bold on the calendar and you can view the
	appointment, but you cannot see the details of the appointment.
	
	Tentative appointments appear bold on the calendar and the appointment appears as
	tentative (grayed), but you can view the details of the appointment.
	
	NOTE: This problem also occurs with recurring appointments.
