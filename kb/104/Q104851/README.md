	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	During Instant Replay, the stall warning may sound even in situations where it
	did not sound during flight. In addition, the throttle position during the
	replay will not be set like it was when you made the recording; it will be set
	to the position it was just before starting the playback.
	
	For example, climb under full power for 45 seconds and then reduce power and
	level off. Switch to Instant Replay and replay the full 49 seconds allowed. The
	replay will show the aircraft climbing at the same angle, but the throttle will
	be at the reduced power setting in use when the replay was initiated. The stall
	warning may sound if this is the proper conditions for a stall.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator versions 4.0
	and 4.0a.
