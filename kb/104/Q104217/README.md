	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Dinosaurs, different depictions of the same dinosaur may differ
	slightly. For example, the miniature picture in the upper-left corner of a
	screen may show different coloration than that used in the main illustration.
	This is because the artwork was taken from many different sources, and because
	many aspects of dinosaurs' appearance are matters of conjecture. There is no way
	to know for sure what color, for example, any dinosaur was.
