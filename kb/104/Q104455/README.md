	========
	
	If you select a topic in the Index, exit it, and then click the Index button to
	view it again, you return to the letter of the topic you looked at last.
	However, if you move around the Index and select a few different letters, but do
	not select a topic, you are NOT returned to the letter you viewed last when you
	re-enter the Index after exiting. Instead, you are returned to the letter for
	the topic you viewed last.
	
	For example, if you open the Index, click W, then select the entry on
	"Warm-blooded or Cold-blooded?" you are returned to the W section when you exit
	and re-enter the Index.
	
	However, if you open the Index, click on L, R, D, and S, then exit the Index, you
	do not return to the letter S when you re-enter the Index. Instead, you return
	to the letter for the topic you viewed last.
