	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using a monitor larger than 13 inches with a Gravis Mouse Stick, the
	aircraft may "lag behind" or respond slowly to stick input. Additionally, the
	aircraft control being used may not return all the way to center when the stick
	is released. For example, if the stick is pushed all the way to the right, the
	aircraft may continue to roll right even after the stick is released.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The Gravis Mouse Stick control panel must be properly configured for a larger
	monitor. Create a set of preferences with the SetMaker utility provided by
	Gravis and then select that set in the Control Panel whenever Flight Simulator
	is in use with the larger monitor.
