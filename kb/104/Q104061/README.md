	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use version 1.0 or 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows with
	Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, the edit gesture (a check mark) displays an
	empty edit box instead of the edited text when the gesture is made on a selected
	(highlighted) appointment inside the appointment book.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Do not use the edit gesture in the appointment book. Instead, edit the
	appointment by double-clicking it, or by selecting the word first and then
	making the edit gesture.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
	Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
