	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some Cinemania keyboard functions do not work the way they are labeled. For
	example, in the Topics Found dialog box, pressing ALT+P enacts Print instead of
	Previous Match.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Choose these options with the mouse.
	
	NOTE: One of the system requirements listed on the Cinemania box is a "Microsoft
	Mouse or compatible pointing device."
	
	These problems have been corrected in Cinemania 1995. They also do not occur in
	Cinemania 1994 when running Microsoft Windows 95.
