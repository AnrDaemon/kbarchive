	This occurs if you are using an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 S3 card with an Orchid
	video driver for Windows 3.x. This message does not occur in Windows 95 using
	the protected-mode drivers supplied with Windows 95. The driver in Windows 95 is
	the Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 Plus (S3) version 4.0.
	
	To avoid this problem, use one of the video drivers listed below:
	
	- The Windows VGA driver, Vga.drv.
	
	  -or-
	
	- The newest compatible Orchid drivers (dated 6/15/93 or later).
	
	For more information on Orchid cards and drivers, contact Orchid Technology at
