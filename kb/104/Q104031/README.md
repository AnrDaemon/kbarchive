	In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, trying to jump to
	the last name in the Address List by typing the character "z" twice ("zz"
	(without the quotation marks)), returns the following error:
	
	  Address: An error occurred while trying to access the name service.

	This problem occurs only in the postoffice address list, not in the global
	address list, personal address book, or gateway lists.
