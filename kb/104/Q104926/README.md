	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Under Windows NT, Peachtree Accounting for Windows version 2.0 (Batch 02) may
	not be able to use some of the company functions.
	
	
	Peachtree will run through the correct steps in setting up companies, but if you
	choose Open Company from the File menu, no dialog box appears so that you can
	select the company of choice to open. The same thing may happen if you choose
	Delete Company from the File menu; you may not be given a list of companies to
	delete.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	According to Peachtree for Windows Technical Support, upgrading to Batch 05
	should correct this problem.
	
	For additional information, contact Peachtree Technical Support at (404)
