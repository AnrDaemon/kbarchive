	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	For each text block in PowerPoint, PowerPoint accepts a maximum number of 19
	user defined tab spaces. If you try to insert more than 19 tabs, nothing
	happens. In PowerPoint 3.x, the tab buttons become unavailable (dimmed). In
	PowerPoint 4.x, the tab button is available, but any attempt to place additional
	tabs on the ruler is ignored.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you need this many tabs to create a table, use any of the following methods:
	
	- Use the Table AutoLayout in PowerPoint version 4.0 and later.
	
	- Use an Excel worksheet to format a table and insert it on a PowerPoint slide.
	
	- Use the Word table feature.
	
	- Use a Microsoft Graph datasheet. To create a table in Graph, do the
	  following:
	  1. Insert a new Microsoft Graph object.
	
	  2. In Graph, select the Datasheet window.
	
	  3. Enter the data on the datasheet as you want it to appear in your
	     presentation.
	
	     NOTE: Datasheets don't support many table formatting features, such as
	     customizable borders, adjustable row height, and word wrap.
	
	  4. Highlight the data you want to include in your presentation.
	
	  5. On the Edit menu, click Copy.
	
	  6. End your Graph editing session.
	
	  7. If necessary, delete the Graph object that was created in your
	     presentation.
	
	  8. On the Edit menu, click Paste Special. Select Picture and click Paste.
	
	  Your table is pasted into your slide as a picture. If you want to remove the
	  gridlines, double-click the picture to turn it into several PowerPoint
	  objects and remove the gridlines one at a time.
