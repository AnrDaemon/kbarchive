	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Arcade for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Arcade for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Arcade includes the game Battlezone, which places you inside a tank on
	an alien battlefield. Your mission is to defend yourself against enemy tanks,
	missiles, super tanks, and flying saucers.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Use the keyboard to maneuver your tank so that you can fire at the enemy or take
	evasive action. Watch out because the battlefield is cluttered with blocks,
	cubes, and pyramids. Use your radar scope and the warning messages to locate
	your enemies, and use the gun sight to aim at enemy tanks, missiles, super
	tanks, and flying saucers. There are no levels to the game, but the better you
	fight, the tougher the enemy becomes.
	
	Starting a New Game
	-------------------
	
	On the Game menu, click New, or press F2. When you start a new game, Battlezone
	resets your score to zero.
	
	Maneuvering, Aiming, and Firing
	-------------------------------
	
	Verify that the NUMLOCK key is disabled, and then press the direction keys on the
	keypad to move your tank. Maneuver your tank and center the target within your
	gun sight. Press the SPACEBAR to fire. Aim carefully - once you fire, you cannot
	fire again until your first shot hits a target or an obstacle.
	
	Scoring
	-------
	
	Battlezone awards big points to celebrate your big victories.
	
	- Tank: 1000 points
	- Missile: 2000 points
	- Super Tank: 3000 points
	- Flying Saucer: 5000 points
	
	Additional Scoring Information
	------------------------------
	
	You start the game with three lives (or tanks). Battlezone awards you an
	additional tank when you score 15,000 points, and another when you score 100,000
	points. Enemy tank fire can destroy flying saucers, but you don't score points
	when this happens. At the end of each game, Battlezone displays the High Scores
	screen. If your score is higher than the lowest score on the current High Scores
	screen, Battlezone asks for your initials. You can add them using the keyboard
	or mouse. If you score one million points, Battlezone resets your score to zero.
