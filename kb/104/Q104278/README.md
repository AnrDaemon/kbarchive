## Q104278: PC Forms: Fax Gateway Does Not Support E-Forms

	Article: Q104278
	Product(s): Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0,3.0,3.2
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
	   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
	   - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, versions 2.1, 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Electronic forms (E-forms) created with version 1.0 of Microsoft Electronic
	Forms Designer are not recognized when they are sent through the version 2.1 or
	3.0 Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Fax gateway is not compliant with the Messaging Application Program
	Interface (MAPI), so the Fax gateway does not recognize the E-form message
	(MEFPAK.DAT), rejects it, and sends it back to the originator.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
	Electronic Forms Designer and versions 2.1 and 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway
	to Fax. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
