	Demo. When you try to start the demonstration, the following error message
	appears:
	
	  Display Problems - This program cannot continue. Your display driver does not
	  properly support the following functions or capabilities: The GetPixel()
	  function. One solution to this problem may be to use a display card or driver

	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, use one of the following two video drivers:
	
	- The Windows VGA driver that is included with Windows
	
	  -or-
	
	- The Microsoft 640 x 480 Dell video driver that is shipped with Microsoft
	  Video for Windows
