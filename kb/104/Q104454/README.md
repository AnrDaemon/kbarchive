	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you drag an icon to the bottom-left corner of the screen or move the mouse
	pointer to that corner while highlighting information in an application, the
	Scenes screen saver activates if its Mouse QuickStart feature is enabled.
	
	Although you can drag the Microsoft Scenes minimized icon to the bottom-left
	corner without activating the screen saver, all other icons, when dragged to
	that corner, activate the screen saver. These symptoms also occur in any
	application when text has been highlighted.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Turn off the Mouse QuickStart feature in the Screen Saver Settings dialog box.
