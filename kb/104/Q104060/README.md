	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows needs to notify you of an event, it
	displays a Reminder pop-up dialog box. This dialog box asks whether you want to
	be reminded again. A field is available for entering a new reminder frequency.
	This field is not pen-aware (that is, it does not accept handwritten numeric
	inputs). Instead, the cursor remains an I-beam and pen input is disabled.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	In the Control Panel Pen application for Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing,
	turn on the Enable Writing In All Applications option.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
	Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
	new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
