## Q104002: 256-Color Bitmap May Cause Slow Redraw

	Article: Q104002
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your screen may redraw slowly in Schubert, Stravinsky or Mozart if you are using
	a 256-color bitmap as your wallpaper in Windows. This problem is most likely to
	occur on a computer with the following configuration:
	
	- MS-DOS 6.0
	
	- DoubleSpaced hard drive
	
	- Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
	
	- 4 megabytes of RAM
	
	This problem may be caused by a combination of insufficient memory and
	degradation or fragmentation of the hard drive.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Stravinsky and Mozart
	version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Because this problem is related to general Windows performance, any means of
	improving Windows performance in general will assist in correcting this problem.
	The following are ways to improve Windows performance:
	
	- Defragment and clean up your hard drive (for information about
	  defragmentation utilities, see your MS-DOS manual).
	
	- Set up a permanent swap file for Windows (see your Windows manual for
	  information about swap files).
	
	Also, disabling the 256-color bitmap wallpaper (by choose either a simple
	wallpaper or none at all) prevents this problem.
