	Article: Q104121
	Product(s): Microsoft Disk Operating System
	Version(s): MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
	For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.
	
	Angia Communications Technical Support has confirmed that ANY fax software
	program may have problems operating on a DoubleSpace- compressed drive when
	using Angia Communications modems.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	A problem exists in the ability of the software to synchronize read speeds from
	a compressed disk while utilizing an Angia Communications modem. Angia Technical
	Support confirms that this problem occurs with any type of disk-compression
	software, including Stacker and SuperStor.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, Angia suggests copying the fax software package to
	the uncompressed drive.
