	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1c 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The version 3.1c Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks maintenance release
	contains the following corrections and enhancements:
	
	- Increased server throughput performance. Version 3.1a introduced a delay in
	  processing messages between servers. Version 3.1c corrects this problem, and
	  additionally, increases the throughput of the server over previous versions
	  of Mail. This enhancement will typically affect large-routed networks.
	
	- Inclusion of user-defined gateway recipients in the Move User feature of the
	  Mail Network Administrator program. Version 3.1a included a new move-user
	  feature. However, at the time of release, it would not extract user-defined
	  gateway recipients.
	
	- Mail Tools server-rebuild process functions correctly. Version 3.1a Mail
	  Tools could corrupt user enclosures.
	
	- The Mail server can now reside on a machine with a CD-ROM drive. The Mail
	  server is now compatible with Apple CD-ROM driver software.
	
	- Correction of a Kanji printing problem from the workstation. Unless the
	  workstation is printing to a Kanji printer, there is no need to upgrade the
	  workstation to a version later than 3.1a.
