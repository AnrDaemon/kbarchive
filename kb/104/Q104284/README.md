	Article: Q104284
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0,3.x
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you run Dinosaurs on a high-resolution display, the title bar may not redraw
	correctly after it has been obscured by another application. The title bar of
	the Dinosaur window redraws in a solid color instead of in the tan granite
	pattern that it normally has. This happens, for example, if you drag the Program
	Manager window over part of the Dinosaurs window and then drag it away.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Click the Dinosaur window; the title bar regains its normal color and pattern.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dinosaurs version 1.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	This problem does not occur in the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system.
