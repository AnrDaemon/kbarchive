## Q104150: Screen Paging Doesn't Keep Up with Music

	Article: Q104150

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may find that the screen paging does not keep up with the music when you
	choose the Play Through button in the section "A Close Reading." This occurs in
	low memory situations, when Schubert, Stravinsky, or Mozart cannot redraw pages
	quickly enough to remain synchronized with the music.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, maximize available memory and system resources by closing
	any unnecessary applications or utilities. If this does not work, try restarting
	your system and rerunning Windows without any unnecessary
	terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) or memory-resident utilities running.
