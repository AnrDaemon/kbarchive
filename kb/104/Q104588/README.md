	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	On page 3 of the version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "Technical
	Reference," the last line of the first paragraph of Chapter 1 incorrectly states
	that you cannot add a new menu to version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:
	
	  You can install up to 100 custom commands, but you cannot add a new menu to
	  Microsoft Mail.
	
	This is incorrect. The [Custom Menus] section allows you to add a menu in version
	3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
	
	NOTE: For additional information about creating a custom menu, please see the
	following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
