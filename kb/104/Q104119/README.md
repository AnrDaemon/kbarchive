## Q104119: Colors Are Strange or Text Is Hard to Read

	Article: Q104119
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Schubert for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Multimedia Stravinsky for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some elements in Schubert, Stravinsky or Mozart may adopt colors that you have
	set in the Windows Control Panel. Items that may adopt the system colors include
	borders, buttons, and text. If you set the window text color to be pale blue,
	for example, some text items in Stravinsky or Mozart may be very difficult to
	read.
	
	Schubert, Stravinsky and Mozart are supposed to use only their own pre- defined
	colors; however, some elements will incorrectly follow the system colors you
	have set in the Control Panel.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Schubert, Stravinsky and Mozart
	version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, use a dark color for your window text and a pale color
	for the window background.
