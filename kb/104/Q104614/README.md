	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Tempest game included with Microsoft Arcade transports you into an
	out-of-control region of space where deadly aliens from a parallel universe are
	attempting to pour through a series of cosmic tubes. Your mission is to use your
	Blaster and the SuperZapper to destroy the flippers, tankers, spikers, fuseballs
	and pulsars before they can fly out of their tube and reach the rim of your
	universe.
	
	As soon as you destroy the invaders from one alien tube, you'll catapult through
	hyperspace to the next tube and the next battle.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Use your mouse to position the Blaster along the rim of the cosmic tube and
	click the left mouse button to fire. Your targets are the invading aliens that
	fly through the corridors of their tube. Watch out for flippers, tankers,
	spikers, pulsars, and fuseballs. If any of these aliens or their missiles hit
	your Blaster, you lose the Blaster and one life. When you get into trouble, you
	can press the SPACEBAR to fire the SuperZapper, but you only get two attempts.
	After that, you'll have to let it recharge as you fly through hyperspace to the
	next level.
	
	Starting a New Game
	-------------------
	
	On the Game menu, click New, or press F2. When you start a new game, Tempest
	resets your score to zero.
	
	Starting a Game on a Bonus Level
	--------------------------------
	
	1. On the Game menu, click New Game.
	
	2. In the Select Players dialog box, click the number of players you want in the
	  game.
	
	3. On the starting level selection screen, use your mouse to select the bonus
	  level you want. You can only select a bonus level when you start a new game.
	
	Aiming and Firing the Blaster
	-----------------------------
	
	Use the mouse to aim the Blaster toward the corridor you want. Click to fire.
	
	To fire the SuperZapper
	-----------------------
	
	Press the SPACEBAR to fire the SuperZapper. You don't need to aim the SuperZapper
	- it zaps everything!
	
	Scoring
	-------
	
	As you might expect with a game that involves a battle between two universes,
	Tempest rewards your heroic victories.
	
	Standard points:
	
	- Spiker: 50 points
	- Tanker: 100 points
	- Flipper: 150 points
	- Pulsar: 200 points
	- Fuseball: 250, 500 or 750 points
	
	Bonus points:
	
	Tempest rewards you for starting a game at a higher and more difficult level. You
	score the bonus points only once per game, when you complete your bonus starting
	level. For example, if you begin the game on level 7, you score 32,000 bonus
	points when you complete the level, in addition to any standard points you
	scored. But if you continue playing and complete the next level, you don't earn
	any additional bonus points.
	
	Additional Scoring Information
	------------------------------
	
	You start the game with three lives (or Blasters). For every 20,000 points you
	you score, you get a bonus Blaster so you can play longer. When tankers reach
	the rim, they self-destruct (releasing two flippers), but you don't score any
	points when this happens. Tempest displays the High Scores screen at the end of
	each game. If your score is higher than the lowest score on the current High
	Scores screen, Tempest asks for your initials. You can add them using the
	keyboard or mouse. If you score one million points, Tempest resets your score to
	zero.
