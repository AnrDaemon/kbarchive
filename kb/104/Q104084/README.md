	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows allow you to specify
	both a normal (proportional) font and a fixed (nonproportional) font in the
	MSMAIL.INI file. If you select a TrueType font as the FixedFont and then choose
	Change Font from the View menu within a mail message, no visible change occurs
	on the screen--the TrueType font chosen as FixedFont does not appear.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
