	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you have Inbox Shadowing
	active and the Mail message file (.MMF) is stored locally, any changes to the
	existing messages in the Inbox are not propagated to the server and shadowed.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This is by design; for performance reasons, the message modifications are not
	updated.
