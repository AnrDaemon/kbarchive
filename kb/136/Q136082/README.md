	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If a comic balloon without a border is put on top of a colored object or
	background, the centers of enclosed letters in the text of the balloon appear
	white.
	
	For example, if a borderless balloon containing the word "WINDOWS" (without the
	quotation marks) is placed over a colored object or background, the center of
	the letter 'O' is white.
	
	Because Fine Artist uses only capital letters, this behavior occurs only with the
	following enclosed letters:
	
	  A B D O P Q R
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve the problem, change the comic balloon style to a style that has a
	border. To select a different style, do the following:
	
	1. In the Painting Studio document, click the Comic Balloon.
	
	2. Click the Balloon Style button in the bottom of the dialog box.
	
	3. Choose any style but the Blank style.
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	After following these steps, text in comic balloons should display and print
	correctly from Fine Artist.
	
	STATUS
	======
