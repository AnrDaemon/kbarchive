	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Project Manager does not provide any hot keys or access keys to switch
	between its pages or tabs.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To move through all the Project Manager's Page options by pressing keys on the
	keyboard, make the All page or tab active, and use the arrow keys to navigate.
	This only allows up and down movement, but it does allow access to all the file
	types of the Project Manager.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
