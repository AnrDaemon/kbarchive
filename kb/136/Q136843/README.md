	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you define 4 inch high custom form and then print to a Diconix 150 Plus
	driver from any application using that form, the printer uses a form feed at the
	end of the document as if you had used an 8.5 x 11 inch form.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
	supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
	applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
	severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
