	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	While you are reading a message on a bulletin board (BBS), The Microsoft Network
	may disconnect and display a disconnect dialog box. If you switch back to the
	message and close it, and then click OK in the disconnect dialog box, you can
	still navigate to anywhere you visited in the previous session. If you try to
	open another message, the Sign In screen appears and you can sign in. However,
	you have access to only those areas you visited in the previous session.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Close the BBS window and sign in to The Microsoft Network by double- clicking
	The Microsoft Network icon.
