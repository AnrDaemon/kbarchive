	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You cannot drag folders to the message window or move folders or messages within
	the message window. This means that you can move a folder from the message
	window (right pane) into a folder in the folder window (left pane) to create a
	subfolder (right to left).
	
	You can also move messages from the message window into a different folder in the
	folder window. However, you cannot move a folder from the folder window into a
	folder in the message window (left to right).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by product design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you cannot see your folder view, you can switch this view by selecting the
	Show/Hide Folder List button when the folder view is not displayed. You can also
	use the View option from the Folders menu to switch the folder view on and off.
