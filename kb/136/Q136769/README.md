	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Setup Wizard and the applications you create for distribution have the same
	hardware, memory, and network requirements as Visual FoxPro. These requirements
	are listed in the "Installation and Configuration Guide."
	
	NOTE: Although the Setup Wizard will operate with 8 MB of RAM, additional RAM
	will speed up its compression of files.
