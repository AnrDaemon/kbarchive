	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the benefits of using Windows 95 sound card drivers
	instead of earlier sound card drivers, and lists steps you can take if Windows
	95 Setup does not install a Windows 95 sound card driver.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Windows 95 sound card drivers are functionally similar to earlier drivers,
	but include support for:
	
	- Advanced Power Management (APM)
	
	- Plug and Play
	
	- Dynamic loading and unloading of drivers
	
	Windows 95 Setup may not replace earlier audio drivers with a Windows 95 version
	if your sound card has features that the standard Windows 95 driver does not
	support. If Setup does not install a Windows 95 sound card driver, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Leave the existing audio driver in place.
	
	2. Contact the sound card's manufacturer to inquire about a Windows 95 driver
	  for the sound card.
