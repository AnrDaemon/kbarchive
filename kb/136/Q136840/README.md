	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft QuickShelf from within Microsoft Word or WordPerfect
	version 6.x for Windows, a macro or menu command assigned to the CTRL+C key
	combination runs. This occurs even though the QuickShelf keys are all set to
	None and the Enable QuickShelf Keys box is cleared.
	
	NOTE: The problem does not occur with Microsoft Windows Write and Microsoft
	Recorder from Windows 3.x Recorder.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Do not use the CTRL+C key combination in the macro.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	CTRL+C is a global Windows shortcut command used to copy highlighted text or
	graphics. The CTRL+C key combination was chosen as a QuickShelf command to copy
	text from an application into the Bookshelf 1995 CD application.
