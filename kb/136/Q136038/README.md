	does not work under Windows NT 3.51. It does not have the capability to
	support the newer features of the Windows NT file system (NTFS) in 3.51
	nor does it support the new file and directory compression feature.

	available on Executive Software's on-line services. The incremental
	release (DK101I.EXE) is available free to all registered users. Executive
