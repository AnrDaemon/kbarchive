	Thank you for using Microsoft Bookshelf Intro Edition. We
	hope you enjoy it!
	
	SETUP of Bookshelf Intro Edition
	--------------------------------
	
	To install Bookshelf Intro Edition, double click on the
	Bookshelf Installer. Installation will take about 5 minutes
	running at 14.4 Kbps and will require approximately 700 KB
	of hard drive space.
	
	If you would like an easy way to run Bookshelf after the
	installation is finished, click and hold the Bookshelf Intro
	Edition icon in the Microsoft Bookshelf Intro Edition Forum
	window, then drag the icon onto your desktop and let go.
	This will create a desktop shortcut that you can click on to
	start Bookshelf. If you click on the icon when you aren't
	connected to MSN, you will be logged on automatically before
	Bookshelf starts.
	
	If you experience difficulties, please see the section
	Installation Help below.

	Installation Help
	-----------------
	
	(These notes apply to the Installer which was operational up
	to June 23rd, 1995. A new Installer was put into place
	beginning June 24th, 1995.)
	
	These errors may be encountered during the download process.
	
	Out of Environment Space
	Not Enough Memory to Run
	
	You should increase your DOS environment to 2,048 bytes, by
	following one of the two suggestions noted below. In the
	interim, we are working internally on a better installation
	program.
	
	1. Go to Tools Find on the menu.
	
	2. Select File or Folders.
	
	3. Search for the file Instbe.bat.
	
	4. Right click its icon.
	
	5. Open the property sheet.
	
	6. Select the Memory tab.
	
	7. Change the Initial environment value to 2048.
	
	8. Click on OK to exit the property sheet.
	
	  -or-
	
	  Use the Explorer to find the Command.com file. Right-
	  click to change the properties of your DOS environment.
	
	8. Select the Memory tab to increase the initial environment
	  setting to 2048.
	
	Cannot Create/Delete Directory Although we have a solution
	for this tech issue, we are still investigating why it
	occurs. The solution  is to locate the following files and
	remove the read only attribute from each:
	
	- Bshelf95.exe
	- Bssym1.ttf
	- Bssym2.ttf
	- Bssym3.ttf
	
	It may be noteworthy that the Microsoft Network directory is
	marked Read-Only. If your DOS window opens up outside the
	directory then you might get this error.
	
	Invalid Parameters
	------------------
	
	You receive a DOS error message "Invalid Parameters"
	You may have attempted to run the Instbe.bat file manually.
	This batch file is called automatically by the Installer
	with the correct parameters.
	
	  - or
	
	You may have an incorrect file association. See To Set Or
	Change A File Association below.
	
	It Downloaded But Does Not Run
	------------------------------
	
	You click on the installer icon and a progress bar appeared.
	After the progress bar disappeared, you clicked on the Run
	icon, but nothing happened. You may have clicked on the icon
	of the file BSHELF95.EXE on your local hard drive. You must
	click on the Step 3 Run Bookshelf icon in the MSN Viewer
	window.
	
	  - or
	
	You may not have the correct file association set up. At
	this time, you need to have a file ending in .INS associated
	with a file called Instbe.bat. See To Set Or Change A File
	Association below.
	
	Uninstalling Bookshelf
	----------------------
	
	If there is a national emergency, or you buy the CD ROM
	version, then you may want to delete Bookshelf Intro Edition
	from your hard drive. Delete the following files from your
	C:\PROGRAM FILES\THE MICROSOFT NETWORK directory:
	
	- Bshelf95.exe
	- Bssym1.ttf
	- Bssym2.ttf
	- Bssym3.ttf
	
	To Set Or Change A File Association
	-----------------------------------
	
	1. In the menu of the MSN window, select View, Options from
	  the menu.
	
	2. In the dialog box, choose File Types.
	
	3. In the File Types tab, click on New Type.
	
	4. In the Description of type text box, enter "MSN
	  Installer."
	
	5. In the Associated Extension text box, enter "ISN"
	
	6. Click on the New button to open the New Action dialog.
	  (If you get an error at this point, you already have the
	  file association  installed, so just back up).
	
	7. In the Action text box, enter "OPEN"
	
	8. Use the Browse button to find the Instbe.bat file (it
	  should be under \program files\The Microsoft Network) and
