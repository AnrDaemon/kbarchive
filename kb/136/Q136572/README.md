	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you run Golf Setup with Windows 95, the dialog box prompt that asks you to
	insert disk 2 and 3 also says the following:
	
	  Some disks may not be required for the selected installation option.
	
	This message is incorrect. The only Setup option, a Complete Installation,
	requires all disks. Setup will continue as expected.
