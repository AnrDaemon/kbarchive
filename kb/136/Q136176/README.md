	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you press CTRL+ESC while running a PowerPoint slide show (to switch to or
	start another application), the taskbar may seem to stop responding. Clicking
	available shortcuts has no effect.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This situation may occur if you release ESC at a particular moment after you
	release the CTRL key. If you release the ESC key first, or if you use the
	Windows key on the Microsoft Natural Keyboard to access the taskbar, the problem
	does not occur.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To regain access to your program icons, press the ESC key again.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95.
