	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using a NEC Image P90 computer with a Matrox MGA PCI display
	adapter, your computer may stop responding (hang) when you click the Suspend
	command on the Start menu.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	There is currently no workaround that allows you to use Advanced Power
	Management (APM) features reliably on a NEC Image P90 computer with a Matrox MGA
	PCI display adapter installed. TO disable APM on your computer, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.
	
	2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the System Devices branch to expand
	  it.
	
	3. Double-click Advanced Power Management Support.
	
	4. On the Settings tab, click the Enable Power Management Support check box to
	  clear it.
	
	5. Click OK until you return to Control Panel.
	
	For additional information about this problem, contact the hardware manufacturer.
