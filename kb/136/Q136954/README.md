	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to format a floppy disk in Windows Explorer or My Computer, you may
	receive the following error message:
	
	  Windows cannot format this disk because it is write protected. If you are
	  sure you want to continue, remove or move the write-protect tab, reinsert the
	  disk, and then click Retry.
	
	If you move the write-protect tab, reinsert the disk, and then click the Retry
	button, Windows 95 formats the disk, but may take longer than normal to do so.
	It may take up to three times longer than normal to format the disk.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, make sure that the disk is not write protected before you
	try to format it.
	
	STATUS
	======
