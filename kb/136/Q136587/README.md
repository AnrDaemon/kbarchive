	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Visual FoxPro includes source code for all of the sample code files including:
	
	- API sample samples (Vfp\Api\Samples).
	
	- Client server samples (Vfp\Samples\Csapp). Available on the Windows platform
	  only.
	
	- Tastrade.app (Vfp\Samples\Mainsamp) including libraries, menus, forms,
	  bitmaps, programs, and help.
	
	- Controls.app (Vfp\Samples\Controls). This includes sample page frames,
	  graphics, grids, lists, objects, timer and events
	
	- OLE automation samples (Vfp\Samples\Ole).
	
	Visual FoxPro also includes source code for these programs:
	
	- Buildapp.prg (Vfp\Tools\Buildapp). Buildapp takes source code out of compiled
	  applications (.app files), leaving only compiled code.
	
	- Convert.prg (Vfp\Tools\Convert). Convert.app converts FoxPro version 2.x
	  applications to Visual FoxPro version 3.0.
	
	- Cpzero.prg (Vfp\Tools\Cpzero).
	
	- Gendbc.prg (Vfp\Tools\Gendbc). This sample program takes an existing Visual
	  FoxPro version 3.0 database and generates an output program (.prg file) that
	  can be used to re-create that database.
	
	- Setconfig.scx. Available on the Macintosh platform only.
	
	- Transfrm.prg. Available on the Macintosh platform only.
	
	- Vfpstart.prg. This startup program loads Browser on the system menu.
