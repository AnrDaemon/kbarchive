	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to print from Encarta using the StyleWriter 1200 with an
	installed printer driver version 2.0, you receive the following error message:
	
	  There is a problem with your printer setup. Please use the Chooser to make
	  sure a printer has been selected.
	
	Reinstalling the printer driver and selecting the printer through the Chooser
	does not correct this problem.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	There is no resolution to this problem if the installed printer driver is
	version 2.0. However, upgrading to Microsoft Encarta, 1995 edition for the
	Macintosh solves the problem.
