## Q136866: Cannot Print Multiple Copies to Microsoft Fax

	Article: Q136866

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print to Microsoft Fax, if you increase the number of copies to be
	printed to more than 1, you receive the following error message:
	
	  This printer cannot support this many copies. Enter a number between 1 and 1.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This behavior is by design. Microsoft Fax assumes that you need to send only one
	copy of a fax to a recipient.
	
	If you need to send more than one copy of a fax, you must perform the send
	operation as many times as you need to send copies.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The print notification dialog box is consistent with that used when you are
	printing to a printer.
