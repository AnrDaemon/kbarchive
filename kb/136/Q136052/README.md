	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Macintosh client is essentially the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS
	workstation with a Macintosh front end. However, the MS-DOS client does not
	include the compress feature.
	
	In the MS-DOS environment, you must run the Mail Administrator program
	(ADMIN.EXE) and select Local-Admin, Storage, Compress to optimize the disk space
	taken by all folders within the Mail database.
