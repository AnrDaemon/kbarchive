	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There are some places in Microsoft ClipArt Gallery 2.0 and Microsoft Clip
	Gallery 3.0 where you will always see file extensions, even if you configure
	Windows 95 to hide the extensions of registered file types.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you click on a thumbnail in the main screen of ClipArt Gallery, the status
	bar always shows the complete path to the specified graphic, including its
	extension. In Clip Gallery, if you click on a thumbnail and then click Clip
	Properties, the Clip Properties dialog box also lists the complete path and name
	of the graphic, including its extension. Also, if you update your thumbnails and
	ClipArt Gallery can't find one of the graphics, the Update dialog box also lists
	the file with its extension.
	
	ClipArt Gallery and Clip Gallery provide this information to help you distinguish
	between pictures that might have the same file name but different file types.
	This information is also useful if you are using a Find ClipArt query, where you
	can have ClipArt Gallery search for graphics by file type.
