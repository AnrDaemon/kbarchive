	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The MVP144win Cardinal modem is not detected by Windows 95, and does not work
	with 32-bit communications programs in Windows 95.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Without the Windows 95 driver available from Cardinal, this modem works only
	with 16-bit communications programs in Windows 95.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The Cardinal MVP144WIN modem is fully supported under Windows 95 running with
	16-bit and 32-bit applications when used with the Windows 95 driver available
	from Cardinal since August 1995. This driver is available free from Cardinal's
	bulletin board and from Cardinal's software library on America Online.
	
	
	If you do not have the Windows 95 driver, you can still use this modem with
	16-bit communications programs, such as the Windows 3.1 Terminal program, in
	Windows 95.
