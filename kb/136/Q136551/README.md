	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Windows 95, you can specify a keyboard preference option that informs
	programs that you prefer to use the keyboard rather than the mouse. Programs
	written to support this feature change their appearance to graphically display
	keyboard-related items.
	
	The Use ShowSounds option instructs programs that normally convey information
	only with sounds to also provide information visually, such as by displaying
	text captions or informative icons.
