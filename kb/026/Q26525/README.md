	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The current screen may be printed by pressing COMMAND+4 and a poster may be
	printed by pressing COMMAND+6. The ImageWriter driver must be installed on the
	program disk for this to occur. However, the Flight Simulator program disk does
	not have enough room to store the ImageWriter driver. To use the ImageWriter, it
	is necessary to copy the program and the ImageWriter driver onto an 800K disk.
	This is done as follows:
	
	1. Start the Macintosh with a system disk containing System 3.0 or later, which
	  supports the use of 800K disks.
	
	2. Initialize an 800K disk (two sides).
	
	3. Eject the startup disk and insert the Flight Simulator program disk.
	
	4. Make a copy of the Flight Simulator disk by dragging the program disk icon
	  over the new 800K disk icon.
	
	5. Eject the Flight Simulator program disk and insert the startup disk.
	
	6. Open the System Folder on the startup disk by double clicking.
	
	7. Drag the ImageWriter icon from the System Folder on the startup disk into the
	  System Folder on the newly copied 800K Flight Simulator disk.
	
	The Macintosh can now be started using the 800K copy of Flight Simulator and it
	will now be possible to print from this disk. Note: the program will prompt for
	the original Flight Simulator disk to be inserted momentarily upon running the
	program. This is required by the copy protection.
	
	If the Make Backup program hasn't been used already, it is possible to make a
	copy of the program onto the 800K disk (which doesn't require inserting the
	original disk). This is done as follows:
	
	1. Follow steps 1 and 2 above, to initialize an 800K disk.
	
	2. Restart the Macintosh with the original Flight Simulator disk inserted.
	
	3. Double click the Make Backup icon to run the backup program.
	
	4. When prompted to insert the disk to copy onto, insert the new 800K disk.
	
	5. Follow the subsequent prompts normally.
	
	6. Copy the ImageWriter icon from the System Folder on another startup disk into
	  the System Folder on the 800K Flight Simulator disk.
	
	You will now have a backup of Flight Simulator on the 800K disk, which doesn't
	require inserting the original disk, allows printing, and provides adequate
	space for saving situations.
