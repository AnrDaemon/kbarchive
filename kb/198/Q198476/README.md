	Description of the BORK Exchange Client Utilities
	-------------------------------------------------
	
	AutoFill
	
	  (Autofill.dll 17.7 KB; Setup.exe 8.76 KB)
	  Assists in resolving display names as you type in the Microsoft Exchange
	  Client.
	
	Schedule+ Address Book Assistant
	
	  (Schedaba.cdf 707 bytes; Schedaba.exe 17.0 KB; Schedaba.inf 576 bytes)
	  Copies Address Book entries, and enters them into a Microsoft Schedule+
	  contact list.
	
	Simple Mail Handler
	
	  (Mergeini.exe 11.5 KB; Smh32.dll 506 KB)
	  Archives and filters incoming messages in the Microsoft Exchange Client. This
	  tool is client-based, so connection to a Microsoft Exchange Server is not
	  necessary.
	
	Internet Idioms
	
	  (Inetxidm.dll 43.3 KB; Inetxidm.reg 150 bytes; Msvcrt.dll 261 KB)
	  This extension enhances the Exchange Client by letting you specify the font
	  used to read incoming messages, append boilerplate "signature" text to
	  outgoing messages, and change the format of replies to use traditional
	  prefixes, such as ">" characters.
	
	Tripane
	
	  (Isdbgn.dll 126 KB)
	  Microsoft Exchange Preview Pane is used to add a third area for previewing the
	  body of messages to the Microsoft Exchange Client Viewer.
	
	Global Send Option
	
	  (Gso.dll 10.0 KB; Gsoinst.exe 4.5 KB)
	  This tool allows you to set global, rather than per-message, options for
	  deferred send time and encoding for Internet attachments.
	
	Cleansweep
	
	  (Autofill.dll 17.7 KB)
	  This tool enables you to delete permissions, forms, views, rules, or rule
	  reply templates from a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox. This utility is
	  useful for cases where it has been determined that Out of Office (OOF)
	  messages or other rules are not functioning properly.
	
	Switchforms
	
	  (Regforms.dll 17.5KB; Regforms.exe 20.0KB)
	  The Exchange client and Outlook client install their own forms for composing
	  and reading messages. If you need to run both the Microsoft Exchange Client
	  and Outlook on the same computer, use SwitchForms to register the correct
	  forms.
	
	Autosig
	
	  (Autosig.reg 359 bytes)
	  This allows the Exchange AutoSignature block to travel with roaming users.
	  Works only on the Windows 95 operating system.
