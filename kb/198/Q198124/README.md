	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you merge documents that contain comments (annotations), some of the merged
	comments may become mixed (scrambled) with other comments.
	
	NOTE: To see the comments contained in a document, click Comments on the View
	menu.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can add comments to a document without changing the document text. To insert
	a comment, click Comment on the Insert menu, and then type your comment in the
	comment window at the bottom of the screen. Word inserts a comment reference
	mark in the document text and highlights the text you are commenting on. When
	you point to the text, the comment pops up above the text.
