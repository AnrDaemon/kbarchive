	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use Outlook for the Macintosh, address information is stored in a
	Personal Address Book, or .pab file. The client cannot select e-mail addresses
	from an Outlook Contacts folder.
	
	Outlook for the Macintosh is not comparable feature for feature to the Windows
	32-bit versions of Outlook. Outlook for the Macintosh does not recognize the
	custom items contained in a personal Outlook Contacts folder, nor can it display
	them correctly. Outlook for the Macintosh does not have the capability of using
	Outlook Address Books.
	
	Use Personal Address Books to manage e-mail addresses from Outlook for the
	Macintosh.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	It is also possible to use Outlook Web Access (OWA)(Exchange Server 5.5 Service
	Pack 1 or later) to allow a Macintosh to see personal Outlook Contacts folders.
	Using OWA allows the Macintosh user to see and address e- mail to items in a
	personal Outlook Contacts folder.
