	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- MSPRESS Microsoft Mastering Products, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	There is a 32 KB limit on how much information can be put in the Notebook
	feature of the Mastering Series products.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Notebook feature in the Mastering Series titles will generate a *.lst file
	on the hard drive (in \lists directory). The size of this file cannot exceed 32
	KB without information being truncated. You can create bookmarks and notes in
	the application that exceed 32 KB, but once you have shutdown the application
	and restarted then the *.lst file will be truncated to 32 KB. Consequently, many
	bookmarks and notes will be lost.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Mastering Series products.
