	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If a Microsoft Word for Windows document contains different odd and even headers
	and footers and an odd page followed by a section or page break that is followed
	by page numbering starting over at 1, a blank page prints between the two pages
	where an even page is expected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Different odd and even headers and footers are often used for documents that
	will be bound as a book. An open book has even pages on the left side and odd
	pages on the right side. The blank page acts as a placeholder so that the odd
	pages do not switch to the left side.
	
	Blank page printing is by design and necessary for book binding.
