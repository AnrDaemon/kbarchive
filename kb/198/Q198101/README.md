	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you switch to Bomb/Rocket View, Chase View, or Spot View when you fly in
	Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator or Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2, you
	may experience either of the following symptoms:
	
	- Ground textures start to disappear, and your computer eventually stops
	  responding (hangs).
	- If you press P to pause the game, ground textures disappear. When you press P
	  again to resume flying, your computer hangs immediately.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if a display adapter based on the Mpact II 3DVD chip set
	is installed in your computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, obtain and install the latest video driver for the
	display adapter installed in your computer. To do this, contact the manufacturer
	of your display adapter.
