	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
	- Microsoft Outlook 98 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Outlook, if you click either the Reply To or Forward button for a
	message, and then save the message but do not send it, the icon on the actual
	message changes even though the message was not forwarded or replied to.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The icon changes based on the message being saved either by the Automatic Save
	feature or by selecting Save on the File menu, and not by the message actually
	being sent.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, disable the Automatic Save feature, and do not
	select the Save button for messages that are not being replied to or forwarded.
	To disable the Automatic Save feature:
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Preferences tab.
	
	2. Click the "E-mail Options" button, and clear the "Automatically save unsent
	  messages" check box.
