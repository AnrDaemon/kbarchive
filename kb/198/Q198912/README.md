	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can use three different methods to install Bookshelf 99 or Bookshelf 2000,
	two of which can run the program without the CD-ROM. This article describes the
	following three methods you can use to install Bookshelf 99 or Bookshelf 2000:
	
	- Standard Installation
	- Bookshelf HD Installation
	- Complete Installation
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Standard Installation
	---------------------
	
	Standard Installation is the default installation method for Bookshelf. The
	Bookshelf installation program copies only the core program files to the hard
	disk. When you want to run Bookshelf, you need to insert the Bookshelf CD-ROM.
	
	Bookshelf HD Installation
	-------------------------
	
	Bookshelf HD is a new installation feature in Bookshelf 99 and Bookshelf 2000
	that copies the American Heritage Dictionary, the Microsoft Press Computer and
	Internet Dictionary, and Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases from the
	Bookshelf CD-ROM to the hard disk. When you use the Bookshelf HD installation
	option, you do not need to insert the Bookshelf CD-ROM to use any of these books
	in Bookshelf. Bookshelf HD does not copy the other seven books on the Bookshelf
	CD-ROM to the hard disk. Bookshelf HD also does not contain multimedia, such as
	audio pronunciations or images. Any Parental Control settings you select for
	Bookshelf also apply to Bookshelf HD.
	
	NOTE: The Bookshelf HD installation uses approximately 106 megabytes (MB) of
	available hard disk space in addition to the normal Bookshelf installation
	requirements.
	
	If you want to use the multimedia features or view the contents of other books in
	Bookshelf after you install Bookshelf HD, insert the Bookshelf CD-ROM before you
	start the program.
	
	To install Bookshelf HD:
	
	1. Install Bookshelf if it is not already installed.
	
	2. Start Bookshelf.
	
	3. On the Tools menu, click Copy To Hard Drive.
	
	4. By default, Bookshelf installs Bookshelf HD in the same folder in which
	  Bookshelf is installed. To install Bookshelf HD in the default location,
	  click Install Bookshelf HD.
	
	  To install Bookshelf HD in a different location, type the following line in
	  the Location box, and then click Install Bookshelf HD
	
	  <drive>:\<folder>
	
	  where <drive> is the drive letter of a hard disk that contains at least
	  106 MB of available disk space, and <folder> is the complete path to
	  the folder in which you want to install Bookshelf HD.
	
	Complete Installation
	---------------------
	
	Complete Installation is an installation method for Bookshelf in which you copy
	all ten books in Bookshelf from the Bookshelf CD-ROM to the hard disk. When you
	use Complete Installation, you do not need to insert the Bookshelf CD-ROM to run
	Bookshelf. Any Parental Control settings you select for Bookshelf also apply to
	Complete Installation.
	
	NOTE: Complete Installation uses approximately 650 megabytes (MB) of available
	hard disk space in addition to the normal Bookshelf installation requirements.
	
	To use the Complete Installation method to run Bookshelf:
	
	1. Quit Bookshelf if it is running.
	
	2. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	3. In the Open box, type "<cdrom>:\" (without the quotation marks), and
	  then click OK, where <cdrom> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive
	  that contains the Bookshelf CD-ROM.
	
	4. On the Edit menu, click Select All.
	
	5. On the Edit menu, click Copy.
	
	6. In the Open box, type "<drive>:\" (without the quotation marks), and
	  then click OK, where <drive> is the drive letter of a hard disk that
	  contains at least 650 MB of available disk space.
	
	7. On the File menu, point to New, and then click Folder.
	
	8. Type "BooksCD" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.
	
	9. Double-click the BooksCD folder.
	
	10. On the Edit menu, click Paste.
	
	11. Close all open windows, and then eject the Bookshelf CD-ROM from the CD-ROM
	  drive.
	
	12. Restart the computer.
	
	13. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Reference, and then click
	  Bookshelf 99 or Bookshelf 2000.
	
	14. When you are prompted for the location of the Bookshelf files, type
	  "<drive>:\bookscd" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK,
	  where <drive> is the drive letter of the hard disk to which you copied
	  the files from the Bookshelf CD-ROM.
