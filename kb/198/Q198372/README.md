	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to do a mail merge, the Merge button in the Mail Merge Helper and
	the Merge buttons on the Mail Merge toolbar are unavailable.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Your mail merge main document may not contain any merge fields.
	
	This functionality is different than it is in earlier versions of Microsoft Word.
	Word does not allow you to perform a mail merge unless your main document
	contains merge fields.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To create form letters, envelopes, or mailing labels, you merge a main document
	with a data source.
	
	The main document contains the text and other items that remain the same in each
	version of the form letter, envelopes, or mailing labels. You can use a new or
	existing document as a main document.
	
	The data source contains the information that varies in each version of a merged
	document, such as the names and addresses of the recipients of a form letter.
	You can open an existing data source, use your personal address book or contact
	list in Microsoft Outlook or Schedule+, or create a new data source in Word,
	Microsoft Access, or Microsoft Excel.
	
	When you create a form letter, mailing labels, or envelopes, the main document
	contains the text, punctuation, spaces, graphics, and other information you want
	to be the same in each form letter, mailing label, or envelope. You then insert
	into the main document special instructions, called merge fields, that tell Word
	where to print the variable information from the data source. When you merge the
	main document with the data source, Word replaces the merge fields with the
	appropriate information from the data source.
	
	To create a mail merge for form letters, mailing labels, or envelopes, click Mail
	Merge on the Tools menu.
	
	For more information about mail merge, click the Office Assistant, type "mail
	merge", click Search, and then click to view "Form letters, envelopes, and
	labels".
	
	NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
	Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
