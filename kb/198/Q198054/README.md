	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	This article lists known problems using Windows 95 for Pen Computing and Word
	for Windows.
	
	The following gestures do not work:
	
	- Edit Text gesture (check mark circled)
	
	- Insert Text gesture (caret circled)
	
	- Context Menu gesture (M circled), can't right-click for Context menus
	
	- Select gesture (lasso tap)
	
	The following symptoms and problems may be experienced:
	
	- Pen Windows display does not refresh correctly when the pen is near the
	  digitizer pad.
	
	- When the pen is near (or in contact with the digitizer) and the barrel button
	  is pressed, the cursor changes to an I-Beam.
	
	- The pen "drag handle" is not shown. This is a small button that floats along
	  with the insertion point, allowing access to a context menu and easier access
	  with a pen.
	
	- You cannot drag a selection with the pen.
	
	- When you neatly print characters using the pen stylus, the characters are
	  connected as if you had not lifted the pen between printed characters.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Context Menu Gesture (M circled)
	--------------------------------
	
	Press SHIFT+F10 with the pen at the point where you want a context menu.
