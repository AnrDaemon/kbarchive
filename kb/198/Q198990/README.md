	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When attempting to edit a large script using the 16-bit version of Systems
	Management Server Installer that is running under Windows for Workgroups, you
	may be unable to view the entire script using the Script Editor view.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Many 16-bit operating systems such as Windows for Workgroups have a limitation
	on how much can be displayed in the Script Editor view.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	It will be necessary to use Systems Management Server Installer on computers
	running Windows 95/98 or Windows NT. These operating systems do not have this
	limitation.
