	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you have text followed by a colon and a tab, the grammar checker flags
	multiple spaces after the colon and tab. This problem occurs if you use any
	grammar style other than Casual.
	
	For example, in the following text
	
	  Number One:<tab><space><space><space>This is the
	  first item.
	
	the grammar checker flags "<space><space><space>This" as "Extra
	Space between Words."
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is most likely to occur when you use spaces to align text.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you cannot use the Casual grammar style, do either of the following to avoid
	being prompted to fix this error:
	
	- Use non-breaking spaces (press CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE) in place of regular spaces.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Align your text with tabs rather than spaces.
