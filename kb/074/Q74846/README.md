	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Although you can install Microsoft's Works for MS-DOS version 2.0a as a complete
	"text" application, it does not run reliably in a window in Windows enhanced
	mode.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is true whether you try to start in a window (by designating this in the
	PIF) or switch into a window (by pressing ALT+ENTER). Works will switch into a
	window, but will not run correctly in a window and will produce the following
	error message:
	
	  You cannot run this application while other high resolution applications are
	  running full screen. The application will be suspended until a low-resolution
	  or text application is running full screen. Check the PIF settings to ensure
	  they are correct.
	
	The above message may be displayed either upon switching into a window, starting
	the application in a window, or when existing Works.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Run Microsoft Works in full-screen mode (do not run it in a window).
