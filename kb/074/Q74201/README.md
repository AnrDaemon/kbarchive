	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When creating a program item in MS-DOS Shell, you have the option to password
	protect the program item. The password is case sensitive. After the password is
	entered, you must type it exactly as it was input; otherwise the system will
	respond with a beep indicating that the password was entered in error. This also
	applies to the creation of a program group.
