	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After installing Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0, Sperry XT computers will not
	start from the hard disk, will not start from the Uninstall disk, and if started
	under a previous DOS version, a DIR command will display only random ASCII
	characters on the hard disk.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Upgrading the ROM BIOS to version 1.58 may correct this problem.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To obtain the latest XT ROM BIOS version (4.71), contact Sperry at (800)
	448-1424, and choose option 4. You will be asked for the BIOS feature
	appropriate to the specific machine.
	
	
	To determine the BIOS feature of your machine, look on the back by the serial
	number for a TYPE CODE. If this code is
	
	  T3070-08, then ROM feature type (part no.) is F5083-02.
	  T3070-00, then ROM feature type (part no.) is F5083-00.
	  T3070-02, then ROM feature type (part no.) is F5083-01.
