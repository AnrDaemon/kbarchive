	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Using MS-DOS version 5.0 Shell to load any Rbase (Rbase for DOS, Rbase Runtime,
	and Rbase Compiler) version 2.11 causes problems with the display in Rbase. This
	is due to a conflict in the methods Shell and Rbase 2.11 use to access the mouse
	interrupts.
	
	Rbase technical support recommends not using MS-DOS Shell and Rbase 2.11
	together. However, this problem does not occur when using Rbase 3.1b.
	
	The product included here, Rbase, is manufactured by vendors independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
	performance or reliability.
