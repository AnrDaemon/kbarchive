	SUMMARY

	When Select Across Directories has been selected under Options while running
	MS-DOS Shell, only the first file highlighted on each drive can be viewed.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When View File Contents is selected, changing to a different directory and
	highlighting a file will mark both files as "Selected." Because only one file
	can be viewed at a time, View File Contents will be unavailable (dimmed).
	Pressing the function key equivalent (F9) will cause the machine to beep. It
	will not be possible to view the contents of another file on that drive until
	Select Across Directories is deselected or Shell is restarted.
	
	To continue viewing the contents of additional files, deselect Select Across
	Directories, or highlight the file you want to view and then select Deselect All
	from the File menu.
	
	This information also applies to the File Open options from the File menu. For
	more information, query on the following words:
	
	  DOS and Shell and Select and Across and Directories
	
	Additional query words: 5.00 5.00a 6.00
