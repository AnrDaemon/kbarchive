	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Quarterdeck's DESQview software can be started from Microsoft MS-DOS Shell
	shipped with MS-DOS version 5.0. However, you cannot task switch away from
	versions of DESQview prior to 2.34, or the system stops responding (hangs).
	
	DESQview versions 2.34 and later prevent this problem from occurring. If you are
	using an earlier version of DESQview, contact Quarterdeck for an update.
