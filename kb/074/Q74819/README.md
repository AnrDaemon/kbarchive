	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use DESQview version 2.33 or earlier, and you have SETVER.EXE loaded as a
	device driver, the Setver device does not report the specified version of MS-DOS
	to the application. This may result in the error message "Incorrect DOS Version"
	when you run a program that requires a previous version of MS-DOS, even though
	it is correctly loaded into the SETVER table.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you have programs that require the use of SETVER in MS-DOS and want to run
	them in DESQview, contact the Quarterdeck Orders Department for an upgrade of
	DESQview to version 2.34.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A list of programs that require SETVER is available by typing "SETVER" (without
	the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt. Additional programs may also
