	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Compaq DOS MODE allows access to a 132-column mode. This is incompatible with
	the MS-DOS Editor and MS-DOS QBasic.
	
	When EDIT.COM or QBASIC.EXE are invoked, the top menu bar and the bottom status
	bars are visible, but no text is visible.
	
	Compaq DOS versions 3.31 and 4.01 allow access to this video mode.
	
	Compaq machines that support this mode are the following:
	
	- DESKPRO 386/20s
	
	- Models ending with n, or l
	
	- New 386/20e and 386/25e with the enhanced video board. To determine which
	  video board is installed, check the serial number plate on the back of the
	  machine.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with MS-DOS version 5.0, 5.00a, 6.0,
	and 6.2. We are researching this problem and will post additional information
	here as it becomes available.
