	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	German keyboard mapping supports a typewriter mode. When the keyboard is put
	into typewriter mode, CAPS LOCK affects the number keys as well as the
	alphabetic keys. In addition, CAPS LOCK is turned off by pressing the SHIFT
	key.
	
	When CAPS LOCK is on while using a German keyboard with MS-DOS versions 4.0 and
	later shift the number keys as well as the letter keys. This conforms to the
	Deutsche Industrie Norm (DIN) standard.
	
	MS-DOS versions 3.2x and 3.3 do not conform to the DIN standard. They work in
	coordination with the U.S. standard keyboard.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In MS-DOS 5.0 and later, the SETVER command can be used to allow the 3.2x or 3.3
	version of KEYBGR or KEYB GR to be used if the U.S. standard is wanted. (KEYBGR
	and KEYB GR doesn't put the keyboard into typewriter mode in MS-DOS version 3.2x
	and 3.3.) This mode allows the number keys to work in coordination with the U.S.
	standard with CAPS LOCK on. However, this procedure also disables the ALT GR key
	and the special characters that go along with ALT GR.
