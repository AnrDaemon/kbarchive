	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Golden Bow software produces a hard drive compression/optimization utility
	called VOpt. VOpt versions 3.0x or later are compatible with MS-DOS 5.0 and
	later; earlier versions may not be.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	According to Golden Bow, VOpt version 2.2 will work with MS-DOS 5.0 and later if
	the partition sizes are under 65 megabytes (MB).
	
	Earlier versions of VOpt will report excessive amounts of lost allocation units,
	and will not compress the hard drive. VOpt will recommend using CHKDSK to fix
	the hard drive. This will not solve the problem; you must use an updated version
	of VOpt.
	
	The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
	make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
