	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you attempt to define an application shortcut key for a program item in
	MS-DOS Shell, combinations of CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, and the number "2" are displayed
	incorrectly. Where the number "2" should appear, a double-headed arrow is
	displayed. This is an error in the way the key combination is shown; the defined
	key combination still functions correctly.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS version 5.0. This problem
	does not occur in later versions of MS-DOS.
