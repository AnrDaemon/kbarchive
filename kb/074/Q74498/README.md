	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Willow VGA-TV video card does not display Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 Setup
	or hard drive backup programs properly when in NTSC (National Television
	Standard for Communications) mode.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Willow VGA-TV card has an RCA jack that sends an NTSC signal to a television
	or video recorder. When it is in NTSC mode and the MS-DOS 5 Setup program is
	run, only the top half of the screen is displayed. VGA mode displays properly on
	the PC's monitor, but no output is sent to the TV or video recorder.
	
	There are two methods for switching from NTSC to VGA mode:
	
	1. Run VGA.COM that Willow provides on a utility disk.
	
	2. Connect jumper J11 on the card so that the card boots in VGA mode.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
	or reliability.
