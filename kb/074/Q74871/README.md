	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Leading Edge XT computers are shipped with only Phoenix BIOS and require either
	version 3.0 or 3.1 of Phoenix BIOS to set up and run correctly with MS-DOS
	version 5.0 or later. A BIOS upgrade is available from Leading Edge directly or
	from a Leading Edge distributor. Version 3.11 of Phoenix BIOS (currently the
	latest version) should not be used as an upgrade, however, because it does not
	work properly with MS-DOS 5.0 or later on a Leading Edge XT computer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Leading Edge has acknowledged that either version 3.0 or 3.1 of Phoenix BIOS is
	required on their XT-class computers to work correctly with MS-DOS 5.0 or later.
	If an earlier version is used, the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 or later Upgrade will not
	install. After SETUP is typed at the command prompt, the cursor appears below
	the prompt, and the system hangs, requiring a system restart (both a "cold" and
	a "warm" restart usually work). A similar effect also occurs when version 3.11
	(the latest release) of Phoenix BIOS is used.
	
	Leading Edge is providing a BIOS upgrade for $45.00. To receive this upgrade,
	mail Leading Edge at the address below, and include the model number of the
	computer and a money order for $45.00. The upgrade is also available through
	Leading Edge distributors (usually at a higher cost than purchasing directly
	through Leading Edge.)
	
	If version 3.11 is causing the problem, there is no "downgrade" currently
	available. A future release of Phoenix BIOS for the Leading Edge XT might
	provide compatibility.
	
	The product included here, Leading Edge XT, is manufactured by vendors
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	this product's performance or reliability.
