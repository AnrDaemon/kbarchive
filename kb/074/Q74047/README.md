	the machine to boot from the floppy or fixed disk by following the procedure in
	this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	While cold booting the computer, hold down both buttons of the mouse until the
	computer reads the floppy disk drive. If the mouse is disabled, use the
	ALT+PRINT SCREEN key combination while starting the computer until you see the
	floppy disk drive light up.
	
	If ALT+PRINT SCREEN doesn't work, try CTRL+PRINT SCREEN.
	
	NOTE: Some PS/1 machines will still run the IBM Shell when you boot.
