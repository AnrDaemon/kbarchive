	Due to a dynamic data exchange (DDE) limitation, the alarm in the Windows
	Calendar cannot ring when you are in an MS-DOS application. However, when
	you return to Windows, the Calendar icon will flash intermittently to
	signify that the alarm has sounded.
	
	The alarm is heard only while you are in a Windows application.
