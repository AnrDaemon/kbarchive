	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If MS-DOS Shell is running and Logimenu or Click are accessed, the following
	error message is displayed:
	
	  Mouse driver not found
	
	This message is displayed even though the mouse driver is loaded.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	According to Logitech, the problem is due to how the Logitech mouse driver
	version 5.01 is loaded under MS-DOS 5.0 or later. When the MS-DOS Shell is
	loaded, the driver cannot locate itself.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Logitech released a new version of the driver to work with MS-DOS Shell. This
	driver is available from Logitech technical support.
	
	The Lotitech products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
	Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
	performance or reliability.
