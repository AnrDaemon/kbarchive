	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	CTRL+SPACEBAR allows you to alternatively select and deselect a file in MS-DOS
	version 5.0 Shell.
	
	This keystroke is particularly useful when the Select Across Directories option
	is selected from the Options menu. By pressing CTRL+SPACEBAR, you can deselect a
	file after switching to a directory in the directory tree.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When selecting a new directory from the directory tree, if you decide to scan
	through the list of files with the keyboard, a file is selected. This is due to
	the normal operation of MS-DOS Shell. If Select Across Directories is activated
	and you perform a file operation, all files that have been marked during any
	such perusal will be acted upon.
	
	To avoid this problem, after scanning through a list of files, be sure to press
	CTRL+SPACEBAR to deselect any files you do not want to act upon.
