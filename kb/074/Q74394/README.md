	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The recognizer shipped with the Windows for Pen Computing in the Windows
	Software Development Kit (SDK) does not support any text orientation other then
	RCOR_NORMAL, horizontal writing. Future versions of the recognizer should
	support other RCOR values. If the Microsoft recognizer is modified in this way,
	this article will be modified to reflect the changes.
