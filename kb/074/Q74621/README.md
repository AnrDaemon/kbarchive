	102-key keyboard on the AST Premium Notebook computer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you don't override this selection, you may have trouble highlighting the
	selected text using the keyboard; text selection with the mouse is unaffected.
	
	To correct the problem, exit Windows, change to the directory on which Windows
	resides, and run setup to install the driver for the "Enhanced 101 or 102 key US
	and Non US keyboards".
