	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
	- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1 sound
	a tone when a compile or build operation has completed. There is no
	option in these versions of PWB to disable this beep. Adding the
	capability to turn off the beep is being considered for future
	versions of PWB.
	
	A beep option has been added in Programmer's Workbench version 2.0.
	This is a boolean switch within Editor Settings.
