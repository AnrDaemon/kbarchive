	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your mouse doesn't function correctly in Norton Utilities 5.0 after you exit
	Microsoft Windows 3.0.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you run an MS-DOS application or exit Windows, the port designated for the
	mouse is reset. This is a soft reset; however, some MS-DOS applications such as
	Norton 5.0 require a hard reset on the port.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Norton has provided a workaround for this problem by including the Fast Mouse
	Reset Option in the dialog box that appears when you choose Video and Mouse from
	the Configuration menu.
	
	To work around the problem, Norton recommends that you do the following:
	
	1. Open the Configuration menu and choose the Video and Mouse command.
	
	2. Disable Fast Mouse Reset Option by removing the check from the check box
	  beside it.
