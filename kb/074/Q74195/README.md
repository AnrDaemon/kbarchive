	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	According to Tandon Technical Support, Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade cannot be
	installed on Tandon Pac 286 computers. The Setup program can be used on these
	computers to create a working set of MS-DOS disks, but the upgrade cannot be
	installed on the Pac 286's removable hard drives.
	
	Tandon is aware of this problem, and is planning on releasing its own version of
	MS-DOS that can be installed on these machines.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Tandon Pac 286 computer has two removable hard drives. The MS-DOS 5.0 Setup
	program does not recognize these removable hard drives and currently cannot be
	made to install to them. These hard drives are also not recognized if the
	machine is booted from an MS-DOS 5.0 boot disk, preventing a manual
	installation.
	
	NOTE: Tandon Corporation has ceased operations in North America. Please refer all
	written claims to:
