	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install the Xprint utility (Setupex.exe) that is included with the
	Microsoft Office 2000 Resource Kit from the Microsoft Web site
	(http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/2000/journ/outxprinttool.htm), the Print
	dialog box may not be displayed in the foreground when you click Print on the
	File menu. It is displayed in the background and you may not realize that it is
	displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur because the Print dialog box is not pushed to the
	foreground and remains in the background behind any other open windows on the
	screen. You cannot click OK to continue printing.
