	When you play Microsoft Baseball 2000 with the Microsoft SideWinder Game Pad Pro
	game controller, the players in the game may move erratically or in an
	unexpected direction.
	
	RESOLUTION

	To work around this issue, create a scheme in the Microsoft SideWinder Game
	Controller Software in which you map the keyboard commands to the D-pad and the
	buttons of the game controller. To do this, use the following methods in the
	order in which they are presented.
	
	NOTE: Before you use the steps in this article, you must install the SideWinder
	Game Controller Software version 4.0 or later on your computer.
