	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use a GPS device that utilizes a program to virtually map the
	information to the communications port it is not detected by the programs listed
	at the beginning of this article and you may receive the following error
	message:
	
	  A communications (COM) port is available, but no signal is being received.
	  Make sure the GPS receiver is turned on and connected to the correct port.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Such devices include PDA or Handheld GPS adapters, and Serial-to-Universal
	Serial Bus (USB) port adapter. This behavior can occur if the GPS device uses a
	program that emulates the communications (COM) port or creates a virtual COM
	port.
