	Controller Software in which you map the keyboard commands to the D-pad and the
	buttons of the game controller. To do this, use the following methods in the
	order in which they are presented.
	
	NOTE: Before you use the steps in this article, you must install the SideWinder
	Game Controller Software version 4.0 or later on your computer.
