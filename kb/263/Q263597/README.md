	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Isscan utility uses criteria files ("crit" files) to determine which
	attachments to remove from the attachments database. Both the command line and
	the criteria file format must be correct for Isscan to process the criteria
	files.
	
	Critgen.exe is a graphical user interface (GUI) based utility that creates
	criteria files for use with the Isscan utility. The Critgen utility provides an
	easy-to-use interface that you can use to automatically create criteria files,
	instead of creating them manually.
	
	The Critgen utility is available from Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS).
	
	You use the Critgen utility at your own risk. Microsoft makes no warranty,
	implied or otherwise, regarding this utility's performance or reliability.
	Verify the file output before you pass the file name as a parameter to the
	Isscan utility.
