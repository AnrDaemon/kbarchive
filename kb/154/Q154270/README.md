	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you change display resolutions, the desktop wallpaper may seem to have been
	cut off, or the entire image may not seem to be displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you change to a lower resolution than when you
	originally selected the wallpaper.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:
	
	- Run the Desktop Themes tool in Control panel and click Apply to reapply the
	  wallpaper using the new resolution.
	
	- Enable the "Stretch desktop wallpaper to fit the screen" option on the Plus!
	  tab in Display properties.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The wallpaper was applied at a different resolution than is currently in use.
	For example, if you apply a wallpaper when the resolution is set to 800 x 600,
	the theme switcher stretches the image to fit that resolution. If you then
	change resolutions to 640 x 480, the image is too large for the current
	resolution and seems to be cut off.
