	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use the PowerPoint Internet Assistant to export a PowerPoint 7.0
	presentation as an HTML document, some information may be lost. Specifically,
	interactive settings that specify embedded video and sounds are not retained. In
	addition, objects on Notes pages are not exported to HTML format. Only the Notes
	text object is exported.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Save As HTML command was not designed to export this type of information.
