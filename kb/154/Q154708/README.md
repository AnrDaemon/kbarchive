## Q154708: XCLN: Inbox Rules Cannot be Modified on Macintosh Client

	Article: Q154708
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A Microsoft Exchange client for Macintosh Inbox rule cannot be modified because
	the Edit Rule button is grayed out. This only occurs when an Alert Inbox rule
	has been created using a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows. This is by
	product design.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	1. Delete all rules with Alerts from the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows.
	  You can do this by clicking Inbox Assistant on the Tools menu, highlighting
	  the rule with the Alert, and clicking Delete Rule.
	
	2. Re-create your rules using the Microsoft Exchange client for Macintosh.
	
	NOTE: This workaround does not apply for sound rules.
