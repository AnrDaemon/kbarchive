	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There are only two sort options provided by the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
	program for Recipients containers. The two options are to sort by Display Name
	or to sort by Last Modified Date.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To change the sort option for the Recipients container, select Sort from the
	View menu. The sort order can also be changed by clicking the column heading, an
	arrow will appear to denote the sort option selected.
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program allows for many different column
	headings to be displayed. Select Columns from the View menu to see the column
	headings you can select. The column headings can be arranged in any order but
	sorting options for the headings are not available, even when clicking the
	column heading.
	
	The Display Name is taken from the Dir.edb file located in the DSADATA
	subdirectory on the Microsoft Exchange Server. The directory can be accessed by
	using MAPI commands.
