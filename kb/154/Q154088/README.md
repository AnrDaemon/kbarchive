	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you attempt to insert a file from a directory shortcut into a message by
	double-clicking the shortcut, the shortcut file itself appears in the message
	instead of the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95 opening the directory
	and allowing you to select files from a selection box.
	
	The Windows 95 Windows Messaging System client (included with Windows 95) and
	Microsoft Office95 products work as expected.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Install Wordmail support for the Microsoft Exchange client.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
	Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
