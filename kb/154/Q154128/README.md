	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you save more than one file attachment in a message at once, if these
	attachments are all using long filenames, the files saved are in 8.3 format
	rather than long filenames.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Save each attachment individually; the long filename will be preserved.
