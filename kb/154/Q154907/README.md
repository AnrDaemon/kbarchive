	================
	
	To enable or disable Quick View for a particular file type, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Windows Explorer, click Options on the View menu.
	
	2. Click the File Types tab.
	
	3. Click the type of file you want to modify, and then click Edit.
	
	4. Enable or disable Quick View.
	
	Note that not all items are displayed as you expect when you are using Quick
	View. For example, when you view a binary file such as an animated cursor
	(*.ani) file using Quick View, you see the binary contents and not a picture of
	the cursor.
	
	
	NOTE: Quick View is included in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95, but not in the
	floppy disk version. If you are using the floppy disk version of Windows 95 and
	want to use Quick View, please see the following article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base for information about the availability of Quick View:
