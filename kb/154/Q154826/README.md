	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Running English Microsoft Exchange clients on Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS)
	operating systems is not supported and not recommended by Microsoft because the
	English Microsoft Exchange clients are not enabled for DBCS operating systems
	and have not been tested on DBCS operating systems.
	
	Support for Microsoft Windows NT Workstation is being considered for future
	releases. Microsoft will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
	Base as it becomes available.
