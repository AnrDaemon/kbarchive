## Q154106: XLCN: Can't Scroll If Entire Address Can't Be Seen

	Article: Q154106
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When viewing the E-mail Addresses tab in the properties of a recipient in the
	Microsoft Exchange client, you are unable to view the entire address if it
	extends beyond the border of the dialog box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When viewing an address in the this manner there is no mechanism for scrolling
	through the entire address. The only way to view an address that is too long is
	to use the Administrator program, bring up the properties of the recipient, and
	view the E-mail Addresses tab.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This is by design.
	
	Additional query words: recipient x.400 custom internet
