	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Two Central European code pages, cpid1250 and ISO8859-2, are supported in
	Windows NT 3.51 through the installation of Service Pack 5, which is slated for
	release in autumn 1996. These code pages are installed so that the language
	support needed to do character translations is supported on Exchange server.
	
	The new files are c_1250.nls and c_208592.nls.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	
	This added feature is slated for inclusion in Windows NT Service Pack 5. This
	feature is in development, but has not been fully regression-tested and should
	be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
	severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Service Pack that contains this update. Contact Microsoft Product
	Support Services for more information.
