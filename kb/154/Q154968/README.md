	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	By default, Visual SourceSafe treats the addition of blank spaces as viable code
	changes. Visual SourceSafe may identify a "difference" even if no code was
	modified and the only change was a blank space added to a line.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To make the Differences window ignore changes in white space, hold down the
	Shift key and then choose the "Show Differences" option from the Tools menu. You
	can also right-click the file with the Shift key held down, select "Show
	Differences" from the shortcut menu, and then select the box titled "Ignore
	White Space."
