## Q154642: Power Management in Windows NT 4.0

	Article: Q154642
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 4.0
	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Power management features such as Suspend are not available in Windows NT
	version 4.0.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	By design, Windows NT version 4.0 lacks power management features.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft plans to include this technology, which is currently available in
	Windows 95, in a future release of Windows NT.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Most new portable computers support advanced power management (APM). Windows 95
	fully supports APM version 1.1 and provides a visual indication of the system's
	power status on the taskbar. Windows 95 includes power- management APIs that
	make the information provided by APM 1.1 available to programs. Programs can
	help conserve a portable PC's batteries by turning off disk-intensive background
	operations and making other adjustments to maximize battery life. Windows 95
	makes built-in power-management hardware easier to use by supplementing external
	"Suspend" buttons with a command on the Start menu, and by powering down and
	resetting peripheral devices as part of the suspend cycle.
