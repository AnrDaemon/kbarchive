	It is possible to convert sound files created on an Apple Macintosh to
	a PC Wave format. To do so, the Macintosh sound file must be converted
	to an AIFF (audio interchange file format) file format with a
	application called Soundedit. Soundedit supports most of the popular
	sound formats found on Macintosh systems.
	
	After successfully loading the file into Soundedit, save the file into
	the AIFF format. Next the file will need to be ported to the PC. After
	successfully porting the file to the PC, run CONVERT.EXE, a utility
	included on the MDK (Multimedia Development Kit), to convert the sound
	file from the AIFF format to a Wave format.
