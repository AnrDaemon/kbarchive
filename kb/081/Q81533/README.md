	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Nested folders that are more than 6 levels deep cannot be displayed in the
	dialog boxes containing folder lists. However, you can still select the folder.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Viewers that show folder lists are equipped with "Vertical" scroll bars, but not
	with "Horizontal" scroll bars. When you use deeply nested folder lists, you
	cannot manipulate these viewers to see more of the tree structure. The following
	dialog boxes exhibit this problem:
	
	  New Folder - Options
	  Folder Properties
	  Copy Folder
	  Move Folder
	  Message Finder - Where to Search

	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
