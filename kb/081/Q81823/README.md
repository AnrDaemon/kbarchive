	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you run an application in a console window, you can press ALT+ENTER to
	switch the console into full screen view. The application running in the console
	window is displayed in full screen.
	
	NOTE: ALT+ENTER only switches to full screen on x86 machines.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A console is a window that appears to run character-based applications from
	Windows NT, MS-DOS, or OS/2. When you start a character-based application in a
	console (for example, CMD.EXE), the application runs in the current console
	(unless you start it with the "start" command). If you start a Windows 32-bit or
	16-bit application, it starts on the desktop.
	
	To switch back and forth between a console and a full screen, press ALT+ENTER
	when the application has the focus.
