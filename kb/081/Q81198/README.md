	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	OLE is a collection of functions and messages that allow applications to create
	"compound documents," documents that combine text and graphics in an editable
	form.
	
	Two documents are available that describe all the steps required to implement an
	OLE server application or an OLE client application. A file that contains sample
	source code accompanies each document. Each document is stored in rich text
	format (RTF). An RTF-aware word processor is required to view each document.
	
	The "OLE Client Implementation Guide" is available in the Microsoft Download
	Center in the file OCLIENT.EXE. PATRON.EXE contains the source code for a sample
	client application.
