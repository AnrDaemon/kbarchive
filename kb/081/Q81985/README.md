	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You save a new file in Microsoft Windows Sound Recorder, but it doesn't appear
	in the Sound Recorder file list.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Sound Recorder doesn't automatically append its default extension (.WAV) when
	you save a file. If you don't specify the filename with extension, the file is
	saved without an extension and it isn't listed in the file list box when you
	open files from Sound Recorder. In addition, the file has no association to
	Sound Recorder.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you save a recorded sound under a new name, you need to specify the full
	name, including the .WAV extension.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
	available.
