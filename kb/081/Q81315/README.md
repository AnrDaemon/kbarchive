	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) and
	the Remote Workstation client require the Modem's Auto Answer feature to be
	turned off. These programs poll the serial port looking for a ring signal that
	prevents the client from incurring phone costs due to invalid or unsuccessful
	connections (such as when the External Mail program is down or busy).
