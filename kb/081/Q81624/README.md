	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses Zenographics SuperPrint for Windows, versions 2.1 and
	3.0.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	SuperPrint is a software application that generally allows fast, high- quality
	printing in the Windows 3.0 environment. It gives you scalable printer fonts,
	WYSIWYG screen fonts, background printing, and batch printing capabilities.
	SuperPrint consist of the following three modules:
	
	  SuperDriver
	  SuperText
	  SuperQueue
	
	The SuperDriver module handles the printing. It allows PostScript-quality printer
	fonts in any size you need at print time.
	
	The SuperText module allows you to make Windows screen fonts without leaving
	Windows. You can build them in any size between 4 and 127 point, and because
	they are built from the same files that are used for printer fonts, they give
	you WYSIWIG screen display.
	
	The SuperQueue module is a batch and background printing utility. It is similar
	to Windows Print Manager because it lets you save each print job to a print
	queue, and allows multiple print jobs to print in the background while you
	continue to work in your Windows-based applications.
