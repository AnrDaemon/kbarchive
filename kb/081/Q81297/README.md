	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Toshiba T3100/10 (with a 10-MB hard drive) and the Toshiba T3100/20 (with a

	The T3100/10 requires BIOS version 2.01 or earlier. BIOS versions greater than
	2.01, such as 4.20, should not be used even if the hard drive has been upgraded

	The T3100/20 works with Windows 3.0 with the following BIOS versions and
	displays:
