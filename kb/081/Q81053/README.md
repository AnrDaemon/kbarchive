	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Agfa Compugraphics Genics is a HPPCL compatible laser printer. Under
	Microsoft Windows, the Agfa is configured as a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
	Plus rather than an HP LaserJet II compatible printer.
	
	Enhanced features of the Agfa cannot be used because the Agfa uses the HPPCL
	driver included with Windows. The Agfa printer is capable of supporting 1200 and
	2400 dpi output resolution; however, the HPPCL driver only supports the 75, 150,
	and 300 dpi modes. Also, the Agfa is capable of printing up to 16 different
	fonts per page, but the HPPCL driver limits it to eight fonts per page.
