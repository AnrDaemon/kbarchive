	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh version 4.0, some of the runways
	at Oakland International Airport may disappear while flying at low altitudes.
	Specifically, while flying at an altitude of less than 107 feet over runway
	9R/27R, all runways other than 9R/27R will disappear. After passing over and
	leaving the vicinity of this runway, all other runways will reappear.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
	
	Additional query words: 9R/27R 4.00
