	Note: The LQ860 can also emulate the Epson LQ850, LQ950, and LQ1050; however, the
	color option will not be available.
	
	The Action Writer series printers are 24-pin dot-matrix printers (*9-pin
	printers). They are basically the same printer as the printer listed in the
	emulation, but the name has been changed. The Action Writer series printers are
	sold by large distributors and the LQ/LX series are sold through Epson dealers.
