	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========

	application error (UAE), future startups of Mail and/or the mail transport
	(pump) start up improperly or do not start at all.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If Mail 3.0 causes a UAE, the Login dynamic-link library (DLL) may remain in
	memory; therefore, the login information may remain in memory.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	When the UAE occurs, promptly exit Windows and reboot your workstation.
