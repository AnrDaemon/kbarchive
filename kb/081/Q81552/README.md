## Q81552: PC Win: Selected Order of Messages Open Out of Order

	Article: Q81552
	Product(s): Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Messages in the Message Center Viewer (MCV) sometimes cannot be opened in the
	order in which they are displayed.
	
	Messages that are visible and highlighted in the MCV are opened in their
	appropriate order, but selected messages that you have scrolled past in the MCV
	are not. This same sort of behavior exists if you selectively highlight random
	messages (hold hold the CTRL key and click with the mouse button) and scroll
	past the initial MCV view.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
