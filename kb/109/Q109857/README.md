	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you taxi around Meigs Field in Chicago and the aircraft travels outside the
	taxiway, tarmac, or runway, you may get the message "Splash" and Flight
	Simulator will reset the situation.
	
	You can avoid this by clicking Crash Detection from the Sim menu and activating
	the Ignore Crash option.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Flight Simulator generates the "Splash" message when the aircraft touches
	blue-colored pixels at ground level. Some of the pixels in the Meigs Field
	bitmap are blue so you will get this message when taxiing over them unless
	Ignore Crash is set.
