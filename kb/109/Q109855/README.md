	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Flight Simulator 5.0 allows you to set thrust reversers in the Learjet during
	flight; however, the thrust reversers do not actually reverse the thrust of the
	aircraft.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If thrust reversers are engaged during flight, you will hear the sound of the
	thrust reversers but they are actually not engaged. The aircraft acts as if the
	throttle has been cut. An actual aircraft engaging thrust reversers during
	flight would fall from the sky.
