	================
	
	For example, approaches to the real Chicago O'Hare runway 4L are Localizer Only.
	When you are approaching Chicago O'Hare runway 4L in Flight Simulator with your
	NAV1 radio tuned to the runway frequency of 111.3, you will not see activity on
	the OBI1 glide slope needle and the EFIS display will not show a glide slope.
