	========
	
	When using the Find option, you cannot search all the chapters of Asimov's
	Ultimate Robot. Only the current chapter is searched for the words or characters
	you specify. There is no way to invoke a global search within Asimov.
	
	This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
	release.
