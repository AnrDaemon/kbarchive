	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Many Macintosh keyboards do not have function keys F1 through F12. However, you
	can still begin and stop recording macros on these systems.
	
	1. To begin recording a macro, choose Macros from the Program menu. If you are
	  using Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, click Macros from the Tools menu. Click
	  the Record button. After you define a key combination for the macro and click
	  OK, the following message will appear:
	
	  Recording <keystroke combo>. SHIFT + F10 to stop
	
	2. Record the macro.
	
	3. To stop recording the macro, press COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+0 instead of
	  SHIFT+F10.
	
	If a macro is not currently being recorded, pressing COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+0 opens
	the Macro Key Definition dialog box so that you can start recording a new macro.
