	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you apply a background to a Creative Writer document, the outer edges may
	be truncated when printing. This is because the Apple LaserWriter has an
	unprintable region of 0.5 inch on all sides, and much of the background falls
	within this area. By choosing the LaserWriter's Larger Print Area option, more
	or all of the background prints.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Creative Writer, press "COMMAND+SHIFT+A" (without the quotation marks).
	
	2. Click OK.
	
	3. From the File menu, choose Printing Options.
	
	4. Select either the Set Local or Set Global button.
	
	5. In the LaserWriter Print Dialog box, click the Options button.
	
	6. Select the Larger Print Area (Fewer Downloadable Fonts) box.
	
	7. Click OK in both dialog boxes.
	
	8. Click the Print button.
	
	9. From the File menu, choose Return to Creative Writer.
	
	After following the above steps, more of the background appears on screen and
	prints on the LaserWriter.
