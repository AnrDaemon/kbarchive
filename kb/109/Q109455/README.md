	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you apply a background to your document, you may find that it alters the
	layout of your text columns. For example, if you apply the T-Shirt background to
	a three-column document, you may find that only one of the original three
	columns still appears. This problem only occurs with some of the background
	styles, and the symptoms may differ depending on how many text columns you are
	using and which background style you selected.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

	--------------------------
	
	1. In Creative Writer, choose the Page Stuff tool from the toolbar.

	  document.
	
	3. Type text to fill two or three columns.
	
	4. Choose Background, select the T-Shirt background, and click on the document.
	
	The multiple column text will appear in a single column down the center of the
	page, and will continue on ensuing pages.
