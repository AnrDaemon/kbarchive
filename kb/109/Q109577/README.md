	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Creative Writer, the Drop Caps and/or Pop Caps features may not appear to
	work properly. When you choose to apply Drop Caps or Pop Caps to a line of text,
	the text may move to the right or wrap to the next line without the first
	character being visibly affected. This happens because the special formatting is
	applied to the first character in the line, regardless of what the character is.
	If the first character is a tab or a space, the formatting is applied to it,
	which results in the tab or space being enlarged. This can cause the text to
	move to the right or to wrap to the next line.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To apply Drop Caps or Pop Caps, you must remove all blank spaces and tabs from
	the beginning of the line. Use the following steps to remove them and apply the
	special caps:
	
	1. Click the mouse to the left of the first visible character on the line and
	  drag to the left. Any highlighting that appears indicates that a space or a
	  tab is present.
	
	2. Press the "DEL" (without the quotation marks) or "BACKSPACE" (without the
	  quotation marks) key to remove the highlighted characters.
	
	3. Click the Word tool (the uppercase "A" in the upper-left corner of the
	  screen).
	
	4. Click the Bank Switcher (the red lever next to McZee's Carpet Bag) until you
	  see an icon with an uppercase "B" in its upper-left corner.
	
	5. Click the icon with the uppercase "B" (Paragraph styles).
	
	6. Select either Drop Caps or Pop Caps.
	
	7. The mouse pointer should now look like a paintbrush. Click anywhere on the
	  line where you want the special caps to be used.
	
	The Drop Cap or Pop Cap should now appear.
