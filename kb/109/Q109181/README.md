	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When an item is added to the shopping list, a dialog box is displayed indicating
	that the item has successfully been added to the shopping list. This dialog box
	does not follow the Windows color palette and will display black and white
	except for the Exclamation icon and Control menu.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When an item is successfully installed, a dialog box is displayed with the
	following message:
	
	  Shopping List Updated.
	
	However, the dialog box is colorless except for the Control menu (which is gray)
	and the Exclamation icon (which is blue). This effect is a result of the way
	MacroMind Director handles the Windows color palette.
