	- Microsoft Isaac Asimov's The Ultimate Robot for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you are using Sound Manager 3.0, you may find that when you play QuickTime
	movies in Asimov's Ultimate Robot, you can't hear the soundtrack. This problem
	may occur after you have opened and exited from the Robotoid Assembly Toolkit.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Sound Manager version 3.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To regain sound in your movies, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click on the Dialog or Credits buttons. This should cause the sound system to
	  begin working again.
	
	2. When the Dialog or Credits sounds have stopped playing, try running the
	  QuickTime movie again.
	
	The QuickTime movie should now play correctly, with sound included.
