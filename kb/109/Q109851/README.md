	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are navigating through menus with the keyboard in FoxPro for Macintosh,
	a delay will occur between menu options if a submenu is encountered. The submenu
	will be displayed and a noticeable delay (about one second) will occur before
	any other keyboard action can take place.
	
	This behavior is by design. FoxPro for Macintosh was intended to be used with a
	mouse.
