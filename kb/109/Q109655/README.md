	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	There are several video and audio errors in Asimov's Ultimate Robot. They
	include the following:
	
	- A tear in the video for Computer Animated Robots, "Fair Play."
	
	- Poor color and tracking in the video for Industrial Robots, "Peter Cahoon's
	  Virtual Hopper."
	
	- Poor capture in the video for Industrial Robots, "Toilet Bowl Cleaner."
	
	The sound in these selections also contains some playback problems.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Asimov's Ultimate Robot version
	1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
