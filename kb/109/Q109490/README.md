	After you upgrade to MS-DOS 6.2, you may receive the following error message
	when you load PC Tools version 8.0a RAMBOOST.EXE:
	
	  DOS version not supported
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Central Point Software has confirmed this to be a problem in version 8.0a. At
	this time, no workaround is available for this problem. The only way to avoid
	the above error is not to load or use this routine. However, the version of
	RAMBOOST.EXE included with PC Tools 9.0 does recognize MS-DOS 6.2 and works
	correctly with it.
