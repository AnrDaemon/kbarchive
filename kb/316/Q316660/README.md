	Q2: Why am I having problems installing MSN Messenger?
	
	A2: Use the following methods before you try to install MSN Messenger again:
	
	- Quit as many programs as possible before you try to install MSN Messenger. To
	  quit programs, right-click the program icons in the taskbar, and then click
	  Close or Exit.
	
	- Make sure that your browser files from Microsoft Internet Explorer are not
	  corrupted. Other programs can sometimes write over or corrupt these files. To
	  install MSN Messenger, you may want to upgrade, reinstall, or fix these
	  files. See Help in Internet Explorer for more information, or see the
	  Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp
	
	- If you use Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft Windows 2000, or Microsoft
	  Windows XP, make sure that you have the proper permissions to install
	  programs on your computer. If you are unsure about what permissions you have
	  on your computer, contact your system administrator for more information.
	
	- This workaround applies to corporate users. Network administrators can
	  prevent MSN Messenger from running in their corporation or organization. If
	  you receive an error message when connect to .NET Messenger Service at the
	  end of installation, you are not having problems with installing MSN
	  Messenger. Proceed to the next question.
	
	Q3: I cannot connect to .NET Messenger Service. Why?
	
	A3: There can be several reasons why you cannot sign in to .NET Messenger
	Service:
	
	- If your .NET Passport is not recognized, follow these steps:
	
	  1. See either of the following .NET Passport sites:
	
	http://www.passport.com
	
	http://www.hotmail.com
	
	  2. Sign in.
	
	  3. If you are recognized there but still cannot sign in to .NET Messenger
	     Service, the messaging servers may be temporarily down for maintenance or
	     may have reached capacity due to heavy Internet traffic (during peak usage
	     hours). Wait a short while, and then try again. To check the .NET
	     Messenger Service status, see the following Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://messenger.microsoft.com/support/status.asp
	
	- This workaround applies to corporate users. If you are behind a firewall or
	  within a company local area network (LAN), MSN Messenger and other instant
	  messaging programs may be blocked by the firewall or your company's security
	  restrictions. Please contact your network administrator for assistance. For
	  more information about which ports a network administrator should open for
	  MSN Messenger to work, please see the "Guide for Network Administrators" in
	  Help.
	
	- This workaround applies to corporate users. Make sure the "I use a proxy
	  server" check box is cleared (not selected) on the Connection tab. (To find
	  this check box, click Options on the Tools menu.) Only certain proxy servers
	  require you to select this check box. Unless your network administrator tells
	  you to select the "I use a proxy server" check box, do not do so.
	
	Q4: I forgot my password. What do I do?
	
	A4: See the following .NET Passport Member Services Web site:
	
	http://memberservices.passport.com
	
	Click "I forgot my password".
	
	Q5: I cannot send files or start an audio conversation with another contact. What
	do I do?
	
	A5: You may be behind a firewall or may be using Internet-sharing software or
	hardware, a system that is also known as ICS/NAT. To learn more, see Internet
	Connection Sharing using ICS/NAT at the following Microsoft Web site:
	
	  http://messenger.microsoft.com/support/knownissues.asp
	
	If you are behind a firewall, contact your network administrator and request that
	they consult the MSN Messenger Help topic "Guide for Network Administrators."
	The basic functions of MSN Messenger should be unaffected because ICS/NAT issues
	affect only certain features.
	
	Also, make sure your contact is not behind a firewall or ICS/NAT. If possible,
	try this with more than one contact.
