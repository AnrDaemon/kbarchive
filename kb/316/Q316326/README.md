	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Asheron's Call on Microsoft Windows XP, you may receive
	the following error message:
	
	  Client has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the
	  inconvenience.
	
	If you click "click here", a dialog box is displayed with the following
	information about the error:
	
	  Error Signature
	  AppName: client.exe AppVer: 1.0.x.0 ModName: <ModName>
	
	where <ModName> is Decal.dll, Inject.dll, Decalnet.dll, or
	fearghalfilters.dll.
	
	If you are not running Microsoft Windows XP, the game may quit, but you do not
	receive an error message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue can occur when you use a third-party add-in module with Asheron's
	Call. The add-in module interferes with the normal operation of the game.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve the problem, disable the third-party add-in module, or contact its
	manufacturer for an update.
	
	A popular third-party add-in module used with the game is named Decal. To disable
	Decal, right-click the Decal icon in the Windows notification area (looks like a
	silver AC logo), and then click Exit.
