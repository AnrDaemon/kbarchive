	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This step-by-step article describes how to use the Add Printer Wizard to add a
	local printer to either a Windows NT Server 4.0-based or a Windows NT
	Workstation 4.0-based computer.
	
	Requirements
	------------
	
	- A computer that is running Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT Workstation
	  4.0 (which meets the requirements that are listed on the Hardware
	  Compatibility List [HCL]). In addition, at least one printer must be
	  connected to the computer.
	
	- Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or Windows NT Server 4.0 source files. Typically,
	  these files are located on the product compact disc (CD), but these files may
	  also be stored on a network server.
	
	- An installable version of the Windows NT 4.0 service pack that is currently
	  installed on the computer. For example, if the computer currently is running
	  Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a), you must have an installable copy of
	  Windows NT 4.0 SP6a.
	
	How to Add a Printer to a Windows NT 4.0-Based Computer
	-------------------------------------------------------
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
	
	2. Double-click Add Printer.
	
	3. After the Add Printer Wizard starts, click My Computer, and then click Next.
	
	4. Click to select the check box next to the port to which the printer is
	  connected, and then click Next.
	
	5. Click the manufacturer of the printer that you are adding in the
	  Manufacturers box, click the model of the printer in the Printers box, and
	  then click Next.
	
	  NOTE: If the printer that you are adding is not listed, click Have Disk, and
	  then type the path to the driver for the new printer.
	
	6. Type the name that you want to assign to the printer in the Printer name box,
	  and then click Next.
	
	7. If you want to share this printer, click Shared, type a share name for this
	  printer in the Share Name box, and then click Next.
	
	8. If you do not want to print a test page at this time, click No, and then
	  click Finish.
	
	9. If the Insert Disk dialog box is displayed, insert your Windows NT 4.0 CD,
	  and then click OK. If a <Printer_name> dialog box is displayed that
	  indicates that the printer test page is completed, click Yes.
	
	10. Close the Printers folder.
	
	Because the source files for the printer driver came from your original Windows
	NT 4.0 installation source, they may not be at the same service pack level as
	the other files on your computer. To resolve this issue, reinstall the service
	pack that you are currently using on your Windows NT 4.0-based computer. If your
	service pack files are located on a CD, insert this CD in your computer's CD-ROM
	drive, and then reinstall the service pack.
