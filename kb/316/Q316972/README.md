	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you have the game set to use system time, the simulation may not use the
	correct date and time.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur when you select a flight that was previously saved. The
	flight time defaults to the time that the flight was saved. This occurs by
	design.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, do one of the following:
	
	- Manually set the date and time to system time in the game.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Quit and restart the game.
	
	To manually change to system time in the game, follow these steps:
	
	1. While you are flying in Flight Simulator, press ALT+O.
	
	2. Point to Settings, and then click General.
	
	3. Click "System time", and then click OK.
