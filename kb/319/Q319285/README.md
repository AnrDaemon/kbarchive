## Q319285: E-mail Messages Generated by CDONTS Go Directly to BadmailFolder

	Article: Q319285
	Product(s): Internet Information Server

	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) for NTS, version 1.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Collaboration Data Objects for Windows NT Server (CDONTS) to create
	e-mail messages from a component or components in Active Server Pages (ASP), the
	e-mail messages that CDONTS generates go directly to the Badmail folder. The
	e-mail messages do not queue up in the Queue folder, and no records appear in
	the SMTP log.
	
	The .bdr file in the Badmail folder with the .bad file may contain the following
	information:
	
	  ...	Error is processing file in pickup directory.
	  ...	The specific error code was 0xC00402CE.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The "From: ..." line does not appear in the header section of these e-mail
	messages. A message must contain at least three parts: From, To, and Message
	Data.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this behavior, modify the code to add the .From attribute before you
	send the e-mail.
