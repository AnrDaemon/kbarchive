	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) upgrade does not
	cause full inventory resynchronizations to be generated by clients.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For software inventory, clients are not instructed by the Software Inventory
	installation routine to generate a full inventory on the next cycle.
	
	For hardware inventory, unlike previous service pack upgrades, upgrading from SMS
	2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) to SMS 2.0 SP4 does not force a resynchronization of
	the hardware or software inventory for all existing SMS clients. Because there
	were changes to the Sms_def.mof file between SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and
	SMS 2.0 SP3, a hardware inventory resynchronization does occur if you upgrade
	from SMS 2.0 SP2 to SMS 2.0 SP4.
	
	For information about preserving custom hardware inventory settings that are
	defined in the Sms_def.mof file, see the "Restore Custom Data Before Completing
	Site Upgrade" section of the "Microsoft Systems Management Server Version 2.0
	Service Pack 4 Installation Release Notes" document.
