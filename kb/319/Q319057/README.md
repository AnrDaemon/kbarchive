	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you subscribe to Web pages, Internet Explorer checks for updates for you.
	You can then tell at a glance whether the pages have changed--without going to
	them. This is helpful if you want to track airline ticket prices or monitor an
	Internet news site.
	Note: Subscribing to Web pages doesn't imply mandatory fees. Such subscriptions
	simply allow Internet Explorer to check for changes to pages.
	This article covers how to:
	
	- Subscribe to a Web page
	
	- Check the status of your subscriptions

	  Tip: When you subscribe to a Web page, Internet Explorer automatically uses
	  the settings in Subscriptions in the Internet Explorer Preferences dialog box

	  symbol next to the subscription page, and then select the options you want.
	
	To check the status of your subscriptions
	
	When you subscribe to a Web page, Internet Explorer adds the page to your
	Favorites list and marks it with a symbol to let you know whether the site has
	been updated since you last viewed it.

	  If the Explorer Bar is hidden, click Explorer Bar on the View menu. Note:
