	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The games listed at the top of this article may stop responding (hang) if
	Advanced Power Management (APM) suspends your computer system while one of these
	games is running.
	
	To disable APM on your computer:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click System.
	
	3. On the Device Manager tab, double-click System Devices.
	
	4. Double-click Advanced Power Management Support.
	
	5. On the Settings tab, click the Enable Power Management Support check box to
	  clear it.
	
	On newer computers and selected older computers, APM may be included in the basic
	input/output system (BIOS) settings. The BIOS can be altered through the System
	complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). For information on how to
	disable or alter BIOS features, consult your computer's owner's manual or
	contact the manufacturer of your computer.
