	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you send an e-mail package from Creative Writer when your e-mail program is
	not currently running, you may be asked to choose an e-mail profile even if you
	only have one profile on the machine and/or you have set a default profile using
	the Mail And Fax feature in Control Panel.
	
	NOTE: This behavior has been observed with Microsoft Exchange installed on
	Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. Microsoft Exchange is a MAPI (Messaging
	Application Programming Interface) compliant e-mail program. Microsoft did not
	test other e-mail programs during the writing of this article.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Make sure your e-mail program is running before you try to send an e-mail
	package from Creative Writer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the e-mail program is open at the time you send the email package, you may
	not be prompted for a profile.
