	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) 1600C printer driver included with Windows
	NT 4.0, there is no option for printing in reverse order. You must reorder
	multiple-page output to put it in the intended order.
	
	For example, if you print a 100-page report, the first page is printed and
	deposited in the output tray face up, the second page is printed and deposited
	in the same way, and so on. When printing is completed, page 100 is at the top
	of the tray. To read the report as intended, you must reorder the pages.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
	4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Some Windows NT printer drivers print multiple-page documents in reverse order
	automatically or provide a reverse-order printing option. In addition, some
	Windows NT-based programs may provide a program-specific option for printing
	multiple-page output in reverse order.
	
	The HP 1600C printer driver included with Windows NT 4.0 does not include a
	reverse-order option.
