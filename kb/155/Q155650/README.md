	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains information from the Monster Truck Madness Readme.txt
	file.
	
	Changing your view to another truck after a race ends does not work
	while the pit board is displayed.
	
	Usually when you're racing, you can press K to switch the camera
	focus to the next truck. When you win a multiplayer race, you may
	find you are unable to switch your view anymore. To enable
	switching camera focus to the next truck after you've won a
	multiplayer race, hide the pit board by pressing O. You can then
	press K as usual to switch the camera focus to the next truck.
