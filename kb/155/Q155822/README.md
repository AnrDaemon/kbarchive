	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In the Paste Special dialog box, if you select Paste or Paste Link after
	clearing the Float Over Text check box, the Float Over Text check box is
	automatically selected again (rechecked).
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	In the Paste Special dialog box, after you select the type object in the As box,
	click to select the Paste Link check box first, and then click to clear the
	"Float Over Text" check box. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. Select and copy the information that you want to paste link.
	
	2. In Word 97, on the Edit menu, click Paste Special.
	
	3. In the As box, select the type object, for example, Microsoft Excel Worksheet
	  Object.
	
	4. Click to select the Paste Link check box, and then click to clear the "Float
	  Over Text" check box.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 for Windows allows any objects to "float" by default. The
	"Float Over Text" feature allows for accurate placement of the object. You can
	drag the selected object with the mouse (or use the ARROW keys on the keyboard)
	to place the object in the desired position on the document's page.
	
	"Float Over Text" is a new feature in Word 97 that is part of the new Office Art
	layer, which is a shared drawing layer between the various Microsoft Office
	programs. The Office Art layer replaces the drawing layer in the previous
	versions of Microsoft Word.
	
	Certain objects, such as paste link objects in the previous versions of Microsoft
	Word, were considered to be inline objects (in other words, part of the text
	layer). Clearing the "Float Over Text" check box allows the paste link object to
	become an inline object.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
	beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
