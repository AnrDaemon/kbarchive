	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you choose a custom Slide Setup for a PowerPoint 95 presentation and then
	save it in PowerPoint 4.0 format, the Slide Setup settings does not match the
	actual slide size if you reopen the presentation.
	
	If you reopen the presentation in PowerPoint 95, the slide size appears not to
	have changed. However, if you click Slide Setup on the File menu, it indicates
	the slide size has returned to the default (10" wide by 7.5" tall). When you
	close the Slide Setup dialog box, your slides change to that default size.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This effect does not occur if you open the presentation in PowerPoint 4.0.
