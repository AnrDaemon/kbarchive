	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When the Show All Mappings check box is selected WINS Administrator, the Refresh
	button does not refresh the Mappings screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When the Show All Mappings check box is selected in WINS Administrator, the
	Refresh button does not affect the Mappings screen, but it does refresh the
	Select Owner window. When a Selected Owner is chosen within the Select Owner
	window, the Refresh button updates the Mappings window for that owner.
