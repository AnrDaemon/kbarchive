	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Monster Truck Madness, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses behavior you may encounter when using some joysticks and
	controllers with Monster Truck Madness. This information is from the Monster
	Truck Madness Readme.txt file.
	
	JOYSTICKS THAT HAVE A HAT SWITCH
	
	Some joysticks that have a hat switch exhibit the following
	behavior:
	
	When two joystick buttons are pressed simultaneously, the joystick
	interprets the multiple presses as a hat switch action. To prevent
	this, press only one joystick button at a time. Or, customize your
	joystick controls. For details on customizing your joystick, see
	the Monster Manual (online Help).
	
	IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE JOYSTICK INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER
	
	Monster Truck Madness only recognizes the joystick configured as
	Joystick 1 in the Windows 95 Joystick Properties dialog box. If
	you have more than one joystick, be sure that the joystick you
	want to use is configured as Joystick 1. For more information
	on choosing a primary driving control, see the Monster Manual
	(online Help).
	
	IF YOU ARE USING THE THRUSTMASTER T1 OR T2 RACE CAR CONTROLLER
	
	If you are using the ThrustMaster T1 or T2 race car controller
	  Make sure you are using the axis converter provided by
	  ThrustMaster. This will ensure that both the steering and the
	  pedals appear on the same joystick. If you do not have an axis
	  converter, contact ThrustMaster to obtain one. The axis converter
	  plugs into your joystick port; you then plug your controller into
	  the port.
	
	Calibrate your controller from the Windows 95 Control Panel.
	
	Start Monster Truck Madness.
	
	On the Options menu, click Controls.
	
	Select Race Car Controller as your primary driving control.
	
	Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on your screen.
	
	For more information about contacting ThrustMaster, see the Monster
	Manual (online Help).
