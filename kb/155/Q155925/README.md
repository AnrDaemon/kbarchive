	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are trying to add a driver for a non-SCSI storage device (for example,
	an IDE or proprietary-interface CD-ROM drive), there is no apparent way to add
	it.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Non-SCSI storage devices such as ATAPI CD-ROM drives and proprietary- interface
	CD-ROM drives (such as those by Panasonic, Sony, and Mitsumi) are added using
	the SCSI Adapters tool.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the SCSI Adapters tool in Control Panel to add drivers for these devices.
