	Technical Support for the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit is available through
	the same support channels, and at the same cost, as support for Windows NT
	4.0 Server and Workstation. This support is subject to the following
	limitations:
	
	- Resource Kit utilities and applications are not available for free download.
	
	- Resource Kit utilities are not guaranteed. Support problem resolution is on a
	  "reasonable effort" basis.
	
	- Bugs can be filed against Resource Kit utilities; however, Resource Kit bugs
	  will have a lower priority than operating system bugs.
	
	- Customers can send e-mail to rkinput@microsoft.com with comments or
	  suggestions on the Windows NT Resource Kit.
