	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you insert a QuickTime Movie (*.mov) into your PowerPoint 95 presentation
	on a computer running Microsoft Windows, you may receive the following error
	message:
	
	  The server application, source file, or item cannot be found. You should
	  reinstall the server application.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if you click Movie on the Insert menu and choose a QuickTime
	Movie file. Although the QuickTime extension (*.mov) is in the list of valid
	movie file types, PowerPoint is unable to insert a QuickTime movie.
	
	If you follow the same procedures in PowerPoint 97 for Windows, the QuickTime
	movie inserts correctly.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the following steps to insert a QuickTime movie into your PowerPoint
	presentation on a computer running Microsoft Windows.
	
	NOTE: These steps require that you have QuickTime for Windows installed on your
	computer. If you do not have QuickTime for Windows installed, you cannot insert
	a QuickTime Movie into your PowerPoint for Windows 95 or PowerPoint 97
	presentation.
	
	1. On the Insert menu, click Object.
	
	2. Click Create New. From the list, select QuickTime Movie, then click OK.
	
	3. QuickTime starts and asks you for the movie file location. Select the file,
	  and then click OK.
	
	4. On the File menu, click "Close And Return To Presentation." When prompted to
	  update the presentation, click Yes.
	
	PowerPoint inserts the QuickTime movie into the PowerPoint presentation.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in PowerPoint 97 for
	Windows.
