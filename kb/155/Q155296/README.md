	Using Monster Truck Multiplayer Feature on Local Area Network
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	To use the Monster Truck Madness Multiplayer function on a Local Area Network
	(LAN), first ensure that the Network Protocol TCP, IPX, or TCP/IP is being used
	on your system.
	
	To check the Network Protocol in Windows 95,
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings and click Control Panel.
	
	2. In the Control Panel, click Network.
	
	3. Ensure that the Network component TCP, IPX, or TCP/IP is installed.
	
	If your LAN contains multiple DOMAINS, ensure that your machine is located on the
	same DOMAIN as the machine you are attempting to connect through. If you are
	unsure of the DOMAIN you are using, consult your Network Administrator.
	
	To activate the Multiplayer feature for Monster Truck Madness:
	
	1. Start the Simulation.
	
	2. Click on the Multiplayer button.
	
	3. Decide with your Partner(s) whether you will host or join an event.
	
	4. The host should select Host; the other player should select Join.
	
	5. As a host, give the session a title in the Game Session Name box.
	
	6. Choose the connection type in the Connection Type box.
	
	7. It is suggested when using a LAN, that the connection type be Winsock TCP, or
	  Winsock IPX.
	
	8. After you select the connection type, click OK, and wait for the other player
	  to become viewable.
	
	9. Select the viewable players and add them to the game.
	
	10. Select the truck and race for this session. You may also enter the Garage to
	  edit your selected truck at this time.
	
	11. When all players are ready to race, the Race button becomes active.
	
	12. Click the Race button to start the race.
	
	NOTE: As host, you control all the start functions of the session. You decide the
	race, and type of race. Once the race button is clicked, the control of the race
	switches to the computer, and all timing functions are controlled by the
	machine. The Pause feature will not be active. As host, you control the
	connection and invitation of the race. If the host leaves the race and
	terminates the connection, the connection is dropped, and all race functions
	will cease. The race will end, and no results will be available. This is just
	like a hang-up in modem play.
