	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run the Legal Pleading Wizard and change the bottom margin to .5 inch,
	the From Edge setting for the footer is readjusted to 0 inch; and text in the
	footer may be truncated or missing when you print the document.
	
	This problem does not occur when you change the top margin.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, increase the From Edge measurement for the footer
	after the wizard is finished.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
	the beginning of this article.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Text may be truncated or missing when you print the document because all
	printers have a unprintable range; and the text in the footer is in the
	unprintable range. For most printers this unprintable range is approximately .25
	inch to .33 inch from the edge of the page. For other printers, such as the
	Hewlett-Packard DeskJet series of printers, this unprintable area is .67 inch
	from the edge of the page.
