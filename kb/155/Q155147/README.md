	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Spaces to the right where the right margin is located appear to vanish when you
	attempt to select them with the mouse.
	
	The following are situations in which you might observe this behavior:
	
	1. The space is the last character on any line.
	
	2. There is an entire line with only spaces.
	
	The behavior may cause some confusion for Microsoft Word users because selecting
	spaces in Microsoft Word operates differently than in Creative Writer 2.0.

	  line.
	
	4. Press the SPACEBAR several times.
