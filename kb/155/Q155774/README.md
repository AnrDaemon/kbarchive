	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view your document using online layout view, the text wraps differently
	and the framed objects appear in a different position than when you view your
	document using either print preview or page layout view. In addition, the text
	and objects are positioned differently when you print your document.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Online layout view is designed to optimize the layout of the document to make it
	easier for online reading. For example, text appears larger and wraps to fit the
	window. In contrast, page layout and print preview are designed to give you an
	idea of how your document will look when you print it.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	If you do not plan to use your document online and you want to view how it will
	look when you print it, select either Print Preview (on the File menu) or Page
	Layout (on the View menu).
