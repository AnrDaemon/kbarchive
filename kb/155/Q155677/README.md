## Q155677: XADM: Input Fields for Storage Limits Display Only Five Digits

	Article: Q155677
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The range of numbers that you can enter in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
	program for public or private Information Store (IS) Storage Limits is from 0 to
	2,097,151 kilobytes. However, the width of the input field is only five
	characters. Therefore, when you enter a number that is more than 5 characters,
	the number scrolls in the input field and displays only the most recent 5.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	By moving the cursor within the input field, you can view all of the digits that
	you entered.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
	Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
