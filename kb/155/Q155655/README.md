	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you eject the Monster Truck Madness compact disc while running the game,
	the system stops responding (hangs) if you installed the game using either the
	Compact or Typical installation option.
	
	If you chose the Compact option during setup, you should not eject the Monster
	Truck Madness CD while the game is running. If you do so, Monster Truck Madness
	hangs.
	
	If you chose the Typical option during setup, you must have the Monster Truck
	Madness CD in your CD-ROM drive to play the game's opening movie, victory
	scenes, and the online Help movies. Ejecting the CD while of any of these movies
	is playing may cause your system to hang.
