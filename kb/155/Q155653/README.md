	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following article discusses issues you may encounter when playing a
	tournament in Monster Truck Madness. This information is from the Monster Truck
	Madness Readme.txt file.
	
	RESUMING SAVED TOURNAMENT DOES NOT SAVE CURRENT RACE SITUATION
	
	Resuming a saved tournament game does not save the current race
	situation.
	
	The current event in the tournament will be restarted when you
	resume a saved tournament race.
	
	TOO MANY TOURNAMENTS ERROR
	
	Monster Truck Madness supports up to a maximum of 16 tournaments.
	If you exceed this number, you will get an error message with no
	buttons to click. Press ENTER or ESC to dismiss the dialog box.
	You will need to delete a tournament before you can create a new
	one.
	
	INVALID CHARACTERS IN CUSTOM TOURNAMENT NAME
	
	Monster Truck Madness uses the name you typed for the custom
	tournament as the file name when you click Save. This allows
	you to easily find the file so you can share it with your friends.
	
	Although Monster Truck Madness does not display an error message
	when you use invalid characters, you will not be able to race that
	tournament. Make sure that you do not use invalid file name
	characters in the file name.
	
	The following characters are invalid file name characters:
	
	  \  &  *  @  ?  :  "  <  >
