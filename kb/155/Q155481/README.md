## Q155481: PPT: Only True Harvard Graphics for MS-DOS File Imported

	Article: Q155481
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0,4.0a,4.0c,7.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kb3rdparty kbdta kbconversion

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	PowerPoint for Windows can open files created in Harvard Graphics for DOS
	versions 2.3 and 3.0. PowerPoint cannot open Harvard Graphics for Windows files
	nor can it open files that have been saved as Harvard Graphics for DOS from
	Harvard Graphics for Windows. This is expected behavior in PowerPoint.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Even though Harvard Graphics for Windows has the ability to save files in a DOS
	format that is usable by Harvard Graphics for DOS, the files still contain some
	Windows file information. The Windows parts of the file prevent the Harvard
	Graphics for DOS translator from reading and opening files saved in this
	manner.
	
	In addition, saving a file originally created in Harvard Graphics for Windows in
	Harvard Graphics for DOS format may not be sufficient to rid the file of it's
	Windows information. Saving the file in Harvard Graphics for DOS to an earlier
	version may be sufficient.
