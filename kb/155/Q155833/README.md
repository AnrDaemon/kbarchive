	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you type information into a Note in Wine Guide, you cannot use the ENTER
	key to create a carriage return and go to the next line. If you use the ENTER
	key while you are typing in a Note, your note is created. This forces you to
	enter one continuous line of text; you do not have the ability to move to
	another line.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Use the SPACEBAR to enter enough spaces into the Note to move your cursor to the
	next line. For example, type the first line of text and then press the SPACEBAR
	entering enough spaces to move your cursor to the beginning of the next line and
	begin typing again.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Wine Guide for
	Windows, version 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
