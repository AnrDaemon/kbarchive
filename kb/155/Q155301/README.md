	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In any product using Direct Play 2.0, the host machine maintains the connection.
	All TCP, IPX and TCP/IP information and initializations are maintained by the
	host machine. When the connection is terminated, the session is terminated for
	all members of the session. This is as expected.
