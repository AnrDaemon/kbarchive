	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you click the Next Page button (located in the lower-right corner of the Word
	window) when you are in either the header or the footer, the header or footer
	layer closes, and you return to the document layer. This functionality is
	different from earlier versions of Word, where clicking the Next Page button
	would display the header or footer of the next page.
	
	If you click the Previous Page button while you are in the header or footer, the
	system beeps. This functionality is also different from previous versions of
	Word, where clicking this button would display the previous page.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a design change to improve usability and prevent confusion about which
	header or footer you are editing. In earlier versions of Word, when you clicked
	the Next Page or Previous Page buttons, Word displayed the next or previous page
	but did not change the header or footer view to correspond to a new section of
	the document. As a result, when you viewed a page in another section and changed
	the header or footer, you changed the header or footer of the wrong section.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work with headers and footers in a different section of the document, click
	the Show Next or Show Previous buttons on the Header And Footer toolbar. To view
	the header or footer on a different page, view the document in Page Layout or
	Print Preview.
