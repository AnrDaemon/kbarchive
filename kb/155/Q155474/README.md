	Article: Q155474
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Any text typed on a PowerPoint 7.0 slide may appear as small dots if
	Generic/Text Only is set as the printer driver. You may even see nothing on
	screen. However, you can click in the text area and receive a typical cursor.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs most often when Windows 95 and PowerPoint were installed
	recently and you have not installed a printer driver appropriate for your
	printer. The Generic/Text Only driver is the default.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You must add a printer driver to display text.
	
	For more information about how to install a printer in Windows 95, search for
	"Setting up, printers" in the Windows 95 Help Index.
