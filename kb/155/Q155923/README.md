	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you double-click My Computer on a computer with a multiple-disk CD-ROM
	changer, it may take a long time (up to several minutes) for the folder to fully
	appear on the screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows NT Explorer reads each of the CD-ROMs in the multiple-disk CD-ROM
	changer for volume information before fully displaying the folder.
