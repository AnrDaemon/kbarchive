	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you click the Start New Page button, the cursor is placed after the
	paragraph to which you applied the tool.
	
	The behavior may cause some confusion for Microsoft Word users because the Insert
	Page tool in Word operates differently from the equivalent tool in Creative
	Writer 2.0.

	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Start Creative Writer 2.0.
	
	2. Open A Blank Page.

	  "1" (without the quotation marks)
	  "2" (without the quotation marks)
	  "3" (without the quotation marks)
	
	4. On the Page menu, click Start New Page.
	
	5. Apply the new page to the number 2 by clicking it in the document.
