	Article: Q155950
	Product(s): Word 97 for Windows

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you close and reopen a document which contains a Document Map area, the
	width returns to the default size. Your custom setting is not retained. In
	addition, the width is not carried over when you open additional documents
	during the same editing session.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Word automatically sets the Document Map area to one-fourth the width of the
	default window. The width of this area is not saved when you save and close a
	document.
	
	This is a design limitation of the Document Map.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	After you open your document, resize the document map pane to the desired width.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Document Map area is a vertical pane then extends down the left side of the
	document window. It displays an outline of the document headings. You can
	quickly move through the document by clicking any of the headings in the
	Document Map. Word automatically displays the Document Map in Online Layout
	View, but you can display it in any view. To do this, click the Document Map
	button on the Standard toolbar or click Document Map on the View menu.
