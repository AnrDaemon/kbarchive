	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If the Start menu is open when a program minimizes itself, the Start menu is
	also minimized.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is a desktop focus issue. When a program minimizes itself, it takes the
	focus from the desktop, causing the Start menu to be minimized.
	
	The Start menu will therefore also collapse anytime an application takes the
	focus; e.g. when an application minimizes, starts up, returns results after
	processing in the background, etc.
