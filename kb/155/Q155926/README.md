	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have more than one CD-ROM drive installed, you cannot select the drive
	you want to use in Media Player to play an audio CD.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Media Player does not recognize multiple CD-ROM drives.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, use CD Player to play audio CDs. If the AutoRun
	feature is enabled in Windows NT, CD Player starts automatically when you insert
	an audio CD. If the AutoRun feature is disabled, you can start CD Player by
	clicking the Start button, pointing to Programs, pointing to Accessories,
	pointing to Multimedia, and then clicking CD Player.
