	================
	
	Deadly Tide Setup runs a performance check on the CD-ROM drive during setup. If
	you click the Skip Test or End Test button before the test has completed, Deadly
	Tide may not run properly.
	
	Immediately after you click the Install button during setup, the Performance Test
	dialog box displays the following:
	
	  Setup will now test the performance of your CD-ROM drive and
	  its use of the CPU during data transfers. This is needed to
	  ensure Microsoft Deadly Tide will play smoothly on your system.
	
	  You may cancel this test, in which case Setup will continue the
	  installation; however the game may not play smoothly.
	
	You have the options "Skip Test" or "Continue." It is not recommended that you
	click Skip Test or you may experience the problems mentioned above. If you click
	Continue, the Setup Testing dialog box displays the following:
	
	  Setup is testing your CD speed and system performance. Please
	  wait, this may take some time...
