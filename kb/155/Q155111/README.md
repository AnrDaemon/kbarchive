	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The help text for Windows NT 4.0 TCP/IP states that the TCP/IP Properties can be
	"used to specify up to five additional IP addresses and subnet masks for
	identifying the selected network adapter...".
	
	In Windows NT 4.0 it is now possible to add more than five additional IP
	addresses directly in Control Panel Network on the Advanced page for TCP/IP
	Properties.
	
	Under Windows NT 3.51 and earlier, it was only possible to add five additional IP
	addresses in Control Panel. Additional IP addresses had to be added through the
	registry.
