	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The client/server features of Visual FoxPro 5.0 are compatible with any version
	of Oracle's SQL*Net and any Oracle ODBC driver, although some functionality may
	be limited by the capabilities of the driver.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Visual FoxPro 5.0 was tested with SQL*Net version 1.0 on Windows NT using the
	Visigenics Oracle ODBC driver that ships with Visual FoxPro. The Visigenics
	Oracle ODBC driver works on Windows NT only.
	
	SQL*Net is Oracle's network communication software. The client/server features of
	Visual FoxPro (including the Upsizing Wizard) work with any version of Oracle
	SQL*Net.
	
	Refer to Oracle's documentation for instruction on installing SQL*Net. To verify
	that SQL*Net has installed correctly and is working from the client, use an
	Oracle client tool, such as SQL*DBA, to connect to the Oracle server.
