	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Electronic mail administrators should be aware that when they use the Microsoft
	Exchange Windows 3.x client, the client maps a permanent drive by using the next
	available drive letter on the local computer. This behavior only appears when
	you are using the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks service provider. The Microsoft
	Exchange Windows 3.x client will not use the Mail.dat file generated by the
	Security.exe utility to connect to a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Shared File
	System (SFS) postoffice.
