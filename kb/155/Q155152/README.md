	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you zoom in and out using the View Changer in Creative Writer, there is no
	scale that indicates the relative setting of the magnification.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Creative Writer 2.0 behaves differently than Creative Writer 1.0, which had a
	scale that indicated the current zoom setting. You will know you are at the most
	extreme zoom setting when you click either Zoom In or Zoom Out, and the tool tip
	pops up more quickly and the writing space is not redrawn.
