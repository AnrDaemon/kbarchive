## Q155790: XFOR: MT Rejects Reply from CHT Outlook Client on MS Mail PO

	Article: Q155790
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbusage

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When replying to a mail message from a user on an English version of Microsoft
	Exchange Server with the Microsoft Outlook client (running against a Microsoft
	Mail postoffice), the reply will be returned to the sender with a nondelivery
	report (NDR) generated by the Microsoft Mail Connector.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The wrong code pages were used for the display name during address conversion
	for messages from Microsoft Mail to Microsoft Exchange.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the fix mentioned below. With the fix, the
	Microsoft Mail Connector now uses the code page in the TNEF portion of the
	message for Arabic, Hebrew and Korean when dealing with display name. Address
	types and addresses are based off the code page installed on the server, and the
	connector always uploads "unknown" recipient props in UNICODE. The display name
	is also uploaded in UNICODE.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
	U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
	following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
