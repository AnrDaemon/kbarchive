	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 for Windows has an enhanced feature for creating online forms
	that is both powerful and customizable: it provides options for entering data,
	selecting choices, and recording feedback. The online form can be distributed
	and collected via e-mail or over a network. When you create a custom program,
	such as a form or a dialog box with ActiveX controls, by using the Control
	Toolbox toolbar, you can take advantage of the Visual Basic programming language
	in Word.
	
	When you use the form control tools from the Control Toolbox, Word disables the
	undo/redo feature. In addition, the shortcut keys for Undo and Redo (CTRL+Z and
	ALT+BACKSPACE, or ALT+SHIFT+BACKSPACE, respectively) are disabled.
	
	REFERENCES
