	When you check your active LUA Sessions in SNA Server Admin Server Properties,
	the number of active LUA Sessions may be 0. If the LUA Session is used as a 3270
	Session, this session is counted as a 3270 Session and not as an active LUA
	Session.

	NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 2.11.sp1. We are researching this problem and
