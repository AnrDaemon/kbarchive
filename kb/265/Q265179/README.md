	SYMPTOMS
	========

	experience one of the following behaviors:
	
	- You receive an "IO exception" error message.
	
	  -or-
	
	- A gray box is displayed when you browse to the page that contains the applet
	  in a shared border.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Nothing happens; no action is generated by the Java applet.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Java applet works as expected in a Web page but not in a shared border.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, copy the Java applet to both the root of the Web and to
	the _borders folder of the Web.
	
	NOTE: To view the _borders folder, click Web Settings on the Tools menu. On the
	Advanced tab, click to select the "Show hidden files and folders" check box (in
	Microsoft FrontPage 2000, click to select the "Show documents in hidden
	directories" check box), and then click OK.
