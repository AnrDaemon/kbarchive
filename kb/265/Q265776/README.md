	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following hardware and software are required for eMbedded Visual Basic (eVB)
	3.0 applications:
	
	- A desktop computer with a Pentium class processor. A Pentium 90-MHz or higher
	  processor is recommended.
	
	- Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0
	  (with service pack 5 [SP5], Internet Explorer 5.01, and MDAC 2.1; all
	  included with eMbedded Visual Basic), or Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition.
	  Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0
	  are the recommended debug hosts for your development environment. eVB can be
	  installed on Windows 98, and you can build your application from there.
	  However, emulation does not work on Windows 98; instead use Windows 2000 or
	  Windows NT as your host machine.
	
	- Minimum memory requirement is:
	
	   - 64 MB memory for Windows 2000 Professional (128 MB recommended)
	
	   - 32 MB for Windows NT Workstation 4.0
	
	   - 24 MB for Windows 98 (48 MB recommended)
	
	- CD-ROM drive compatible with multimedia desktop computer specification.
	
	- VGA or higher-resolution monitor required. A Super VGA monitor is
	  recommended.
	
	- Mouse device or compatible pointing device.
	
	- A serial port is required for debugging.
	
	- Adequate hard disk drive space. eMbedded Visual Tools requires 200 MB;
	  additional SDKs require 200 MB each.
