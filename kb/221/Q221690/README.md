	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Visual FoxPro crashes with a C0000005 error after running a SQL Select statement
	that uses the BETWEEN() function. Repeatedly requerying a view that is defined
	using the BETWEEN() function might also cause this problem.
	
	This problem can be intermittent and might only happen on certain computers.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
	beginning of this article.
	
	This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information

	Steps to Reproduce Behavior
	---------------------------
	
	1. Copy the following code into a new program file in Visual FoxPro:
	
	  SET STRICTDATE TO 0
	  FOR q=1 TO 1000
	     WAIT WINDOW TRANS(q) NOWAIT
	     SELECT * FROM HOME(2)+"data\orders" ;
	     WHERE order_date BETWEEN {07/03/19963} and DATE() ;
	     INTO CURSOR junk
	  ENDFOR
	
	2. Save and run the program.
	
	3. If the computer is subject to the problem, Visual FoxPro should crash with a
	  C0000005 error somewhere between 10 and 20 times through the loop.
