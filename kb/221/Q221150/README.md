## Q221150: NET USE to 16 Character Dotted-DNS Name May Fail

	Article: Q221150
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400sp5fix
	Last Modified: 20-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The NET USE command fails to connect to a server with a 16-character DNS name
	(such as xxxxx.xxxxxx.xxx).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	NetBIOS names are limited to 16 characters. The last character is reserved for
	the system and is a special character used to identify the resource type. When
	connecting to a DNS-style name, the sixteenth character was being modified by
	the system instead of being passed to the DNS. DNS-style names should be passed
	"literally" to the domain name resolver to be resolved.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
