	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a Web Links page in Microsoft Business Planner, the printed
	output may be cut off at the right margin of the page.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the Web Links page contains an Internet address that
	extends beyond the margin of the page.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they
	are presented.
	
	Configure Your Printer to Print in Landscape Mode
	-------------------------------------------------
	
	To configure your printer to print in Landscape mode:
	
	1. On the File menu, click Print.
	
	2. Click Properties.
	
	3. Click the Paper tab.
	
	4. In the Paper Size box, click Letter.
	
	5. Under Orientation, click Landscape.
	
	6. Click OK.
	
	If the printed output still does not fit on the page, proceed to the next
	method.
	
	Copy and Paste the Page to Microsoft WordPad
	--------------------------------------------
	
	To copy and paste the page to WordPad:
	
	1. Use your pointing device to click inside the Web Links page.
	
	  NOTE: Do not click directly on the text of an Internet address, as this action
	  starts your Web browser and connects you to the corresponding Web site.

	3. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click WordPad.
