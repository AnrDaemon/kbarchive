## Q233214: STOP Error Occurs Even If CrashOnAuditFail Is Disabled

{% raw %}

	Article: Q233214
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix
	Last Modified: 20-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may receive a "STOP 0xC0000244 (STATUS_AUDIT_FAILED)" error message on a
	blue screen, even though the CrashOnAuditFail registry value is not set.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because an audit failure has actually occurred, probably
	because the Security event log has overflowed. Sometimes, Windows then behaves
	as if the CrashOnAuditFail value is enabled and causes the computer to display
	the error message.
