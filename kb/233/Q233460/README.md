	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you share a business plan created in Microsoft Business Planner over a
	network, data that is entered into the Business Plan wizard may be unexpectedly
	changed or lost.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:
	
	- The folder containing the business plan is shared with full access rights to
	  multiple users.
	
	- A user with access to the shared folder saves changes to the business plan.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, contact the owner of the business plan before you
	enter data in the plan.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Business Planner.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you are entering data in a shared business plan, you are not notified if
	another user opens that plan. As a result, multiple users can overwrite business
	plan data without being aware that they are doing so.
