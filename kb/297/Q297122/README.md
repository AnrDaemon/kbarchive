	stating, "We're very sorry, but the MSN service needs to restart because of an
	error". MSN Explorer presents you with two options:
	
	- "Tell MSN about this!"
	
	- "Don't Tell MSN!"
	
	After you select an option, MSN Explorer shuts down and restarts.

	Express configuration tool to view your e-mail in Outlook Express.

	  in the Address box, you will get a warning asking if you "are sure you want
	  to go to the Hotmail Web site".
	
	3. Click the Go to Hotmail Web site button.
	
	To save attachment to disk
	
	1. Double-click the attachment that you want to open.
	
	2. Select Save to disk and click OK.
