## Q297127: Users With Web-based E-mail Accounts Can Receive At Both @msn.co

	Article: Q297127
	Product(s): The Microsoft Network
	Version(s): 6.0,6.1
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 10-MAY-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network versions 6.0, 6.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use a free msn.com e-mail address, you may discover (possibly through
	replies to your e-mail messages) that you can receive e-mail from both msn.com
	and hotmail.msn.com addresses (userid@msn.com and userid@hotmail.msn.com).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	MSN uses certain conventions to differentiate between users with Post Office
	Protocol 3 (POP3) e-mail accounts and those with Web-based email accounts. Users
	with POP3 e-mail accounts will be routed to userid@email.msn.com and users with
	Web-based accounts will be routed to userid@hotmail.msn.com.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The "@hotmail.msn.com" e-mail suffix is a convention that MSN uses to
	differentiate between POP3 and Web-based e-mail accounts, but it is not
	necessary for you to use an address such as userid@hotmail.msn.com. You can
	still receive e-mail using only the "@msn.com" (userid@msn.com).
