	Incorrect Score Given For Question 2 Under Printing Worksheets Proficient Skills Quiz
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When taking the quiz in the Excel 97 Proficient section, under Excel Basic, in
	the "Printing Worksheets" selection, question 2 gives an incorrect score. The
	third option is the correct answer for question 2, but it is marked wrong with a
	red "X". When the second answer in this multiple choice question is selected,
	the feedback field states that the answer is incorrect, but marks the answer
	with a green check mark. The green check mark signifies a correct answer, and
	causes an error in the scoring.
	
	Since the correct answer is not marked with the green check mark, you will end up
	with a score of 66% instead of 100% when you answer the question correctly.
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
