	After you copy an article containing both text and a picture from Bookshelf 1995
	or Bookshelf '96-'97 (16-bit), you are unable to paste the entire article into
	Lotus AmiPro. Either the article text or the picture does not appear.
	
	If you are using an early version of AmiPro, the program may stop responding
	(hang).
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Copy and paste the article text and picture separately from Bookshelf.
