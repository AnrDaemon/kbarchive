	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to start The Ultimate Robot Screen Saver Viewer, you receive the
	following error message:
	
	  Not enough memory to run Macromedia Player
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The problem occurs on monitors larger than 16" with the color depth set to
	Millions of colors. Changing the color depth to Thousands of colors allows the
	program to start successfully without generating the error message.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Reduce the number of colors for your video display. To change the color depth on
	the Macintosh, do the following:
	
	1. Open the System Folder.
	
	2. Open the Control Panels folder.
	
	3. Open the Monitors control panel.
	
	4. Change the color depth listed in the Settings Of Selected Monitor dialog box
	  from Millions Of Colors to either Thousands Of Colors or 256 Colors.
	
	5. Close the Monitors control panel.
	
	6. Start the Screen Saver.
