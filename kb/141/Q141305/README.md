	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Although you can print successfully to network printers in Windows 95, Winpopup
	may not notify you when print jobs are completed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Winpopup does not notify you when print jobs are completed when you print from a
	Windows 95-based computer to a printer shared by another Windows 95-based
	computer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This problem occurs only when you print from a Windows 95-based computer to a
	printer shared by another Windows 95-based computer. For example, Winpopup does
	deliver print notifications when you print to a network printer shared on a
	Microsoft Windows NT-based computer.
