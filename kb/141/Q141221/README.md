	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 1.1b 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 1.1b 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print to a Canon BubbleJet from either Fine Artist or Creative Writer
	in Windows 95, you see gray squares surrounding the stickers (clip art) on your
	printout. The painting looks fine on the screen and also in the preview of the
	printout.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, use the following steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
	
	2. Click the printer you want to use. On the File menu, click Properties.
	
	3. Click the Graphics tab.
	
	4. In the Dithering section, click Error Diffusion.
	
	5. Click OK to close Printer Properties.
	
	If you are still unable to print correctly, repeat steps 1-5, but in step 4, in
	the Dithering section, try switching to one of the other options (i.e., Fine).
	
	-or-
	
	Use a different printer driver (for example, Epson LQ 2550 or Epson LQ 860 for
	the Canon 600e printer).
	
	After following these steps, you should be able to print successfully from Fine
	Artist and/or Creative Writer.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	It appears that some printer drivers interpret the area surrounding the picture
	to be something other than transparent. Setting the printer to Diffusion makes
	the driver interpret the picture differently.
