## Q141309: MS Plus! Setup Cannot Display 1 GB or More Free Disk Space

	Article: Q141309
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): 95
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): win95
	Last Modified: 18-DEC-2000
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Microsoft Plus! using the Custom Setup option, the Custom Setup
	dialog box does not display free disk space of 1 gigabyte (GB) or more.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Setup cannot display the gigabyte unit correctly. If a disk has 1 GB or more of
	free disk space, Setup displays only 999,999K as being available. The incorrect
	amount of free disk space displayed does not affect Setup's ability to
	successfully install Microsoft Plus!.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Plus! version 1.0 for
	Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
