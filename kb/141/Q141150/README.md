	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Automap Streets for Windows, version 4.0 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
	- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have the Microsoft Plus! "Show window contents while dragging" feature
	enabled, and you drag a small window over an Automap Streets 4.0 window,
	portions of the Streets map may erase.
	
	The problem occurs even if the window you drag is smaller than the Streets
	window. Also, the dragged window does not have to touch the portion of the
	Streets window that becomes corrupted.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, disable the "Show window contents while dragging"
	feature in Windows 95/98.
	
	For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
	printed documentation or online Help.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Streets version 4.0.
