	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The minimum system requirements to run 3D Movie Maker are a 486/50Mhz computer
	with at least 8 MB of RAM and a double speed CD-ROM drive.
	
	Due to the complexity of the animation in 3D Movie Maker, a machine with the
	minimum system requirements may appear to run slowly. Although nothing can take
	the place of a faster processor and additional RAM, this article contains
	several suggestions that you can use to optimize your computer for running 3D
	Movie Maker.
	
	MORE INFORMATION

	To improve the performance of 3D Movie Maker, try the following:
	
	Use Options in Product Information Window
	-----------------------------------------
	
	In 3D Movie Maker, press CTRL+SHIFT+I to access the Product Information screen.
	For improved performance, click Better Speed and/or Run In Window option(s). The
	Better Speed option reduces the quality of the animation. The Run In Window
	option disables full screen mode. If you want to use these settings as the
	default, click the Make These The Default Settings check box to select it before
	you click OK.
	
	Close Other Programs
	--------------------
	
	For improved performance, 3D Movie Maker should be the only program running on
	the system. To verify that all other programs are closed, press CTRL+ALT+DEL
	once to display the Close Program window (list of programs programs), and close
	everything except Systray and your Windows shell. In a standard configuration of
	Windows, the Windows shell is Windows Explorer.

	If the video driver you are using is configured to display more than 256 colors,
	you may be able to improve the performance of 3D Movie Maker by setting the
	number of colors to 256. Use the following steps to change your display settings
	in Windows:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click Display, and then click the Settings tab.
	
	3. In the Color Palette or Colors box, click 256 Color, and then click OK.

	the type of computer you are using.
