	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
	   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This is the 32-bit version of this sample.
	
	The Dlgdb32 code sample demonstrates how to have a CDialog derived class share a
	CRecordset object that a CRecordView is already using. In addition, when used by
	itself, the code sample also demonstrates how to select CRecordset object from a
	CDocument without having a CRecordView.
	
	NOTE: This sample assumes that ODBC has been installed and that the Student
	Registration data source has been configured.
