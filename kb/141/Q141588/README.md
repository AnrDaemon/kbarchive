## Q141588: Services Not Closed Properly During Forced Shutdown

{% raw %}

	Article: Q141588
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 3.5,3.51,4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbnetwork

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows NT services are forced to terminate immediately during shutdown.
	Therefore some of these services are not closed properly. For example, a UPS
	power outage may force a immediate shutdown while the services are running and
	cannot properly close the services in less than 20 seconds (forced shutdown time
	interval).
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
	Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
	post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
