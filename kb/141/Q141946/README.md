	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Delivery receipts are not available for e-mail sent from MSN, The Microsoft
	Network, over the Internet.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Delivery receipts are generated by the mail server that contains the recipient's
	mailbox. MSN cannot determine the recipient's mail server before sending the
	mail and cannot assume that the server supports delivery receipts. Therefore,
	MSN cannot safely format and send a request for a delivery receipt.
