	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Bookshelf, if you open the Table of Contents for any individual book, the
	Spell Checker may not seem to function properly.
	
	No suggestions are provided for a misspelled word. For example, if you open the
	Table of Contents for The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia and attempt to spell
	check "supose", the Spell Checker does not suggest any alternate words.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design and not a problem with Bookshelf.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Before you type the word you want to spell check, do one of the following:
	
	- In the Tabbed Lists area of the individual book, Click the Find Tab.
	
	  -or-
	
	- Click the All Books icon on the Book toolbar.
	
	If a word is not listed in the Table of Contents of an individual book, then the
	word cannot be suggested by the Spell Checker from the Table of Contents of the
	particular book.
	
	When you click the Find Tab, you tell the Spell Checker to search the entire
	contents of the book, not just its Table Of Contents.
