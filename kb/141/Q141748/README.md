	CAUSE
	=====
	
	A version of QuickTime prior to 1.6.2 is installed and currently loaded in the
	Extensions folder or QuickTime is not installed at all. Encarta 1994 requires
	QuickTime 1.6.2 or later.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Install QuickTime version 1.6.2 or later.
	
	To install QuickTime version 1.6.2, use one of the following methods:
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	Run the Encarta 1994 installation program again.
	
	To run the Encarta Installer program, do the following:
	
	1. Open the Encarta 1994, compact disc.
	
	2. Double-click the Install Encarta icon.
	
	3. At the Encarta 1994 Edition title screen click OK.
	
	4. At the main installation screen, click Customize.
	
	5. When you are prompted, select QuickTime 1.6.2 and then click Install.
	
	6. Click Continue. This automatically quits all other open programs.
	
	7. After the installation completes, click Restart.
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	Copy QuickTime 1.6.2 from the Encarta 1994 CD-ROM and replace the existing
	version of QuickTime in your Extensions folder.
	
	To manually install the QuickTime 1.6.2 system extension do the following:
	
	1. On your Macintosh, open the System Folder.
	
	2. Open the Extensions Folder.
	
	3. Select the QuickTime icon.
	
	4. On the File menu, click Get Info. Check if the version of QuickTime is lower
	  than 1.6.2.
	
	5. Close the Get Info window.
	
	6. Drag the QuickTime system extension into the Trash.
	
	7. Open the Encarta 1994 compact disc.
	
	8. Open the Installer Files folder.
	
	9. Open the System Files folder.
	
	10. Drag the QuickTime system extension from the compact disc into the
	  Extensions folder.
	
	11. On the Special menu, click Restart.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Encarta 1994 installs QuickTime version 1.6.2. Other applications may replace
	this with an older version. The replacement of Quicktime is the most common
	cause of the error message.
