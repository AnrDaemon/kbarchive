	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you have more than one presentation open at a time, and if you try to print
	these presentations by clicking the Print button, you may receive the following
	error message:
	
	  This is not a valid page range.
	
	Only one of the presentations is printed.

	1. On the File menu, click Slide Setup.
	
	2. Change the number in the Number Slides From box.
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========

	presentation correctly. However, you have to print each presentation
	separately.

	1. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, hold down the SHIFT key and click more
	  than one presentation.
	
	2. Using the right mouse button, click one of the presentations in the
