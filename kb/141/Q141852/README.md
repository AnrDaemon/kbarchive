	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you start and close Microsoft System Information version 2.5 from one of
	the applications appearing at the top of this article and the computer system is
	running Windows 95, all system sounds become disabled. Sounds appear to be
	playing, yet no sound is heard.

	version 2.51 which fixes this problem.

	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:
	
	METHOD 1
	--------
	
	On the Task Bar, click the sound icon one time and click the Mute option. After
	clicking the Mute box a small check mark will appear in the box.
	
	NOTE: This method causes the system to turn the sound feature on. The Volume
	Control dialog box indicates all sounds are muted and the Volume Control icon on
	the Task Bar indicates sound functionality has been turned off.
	
	METHOD 2
	--------
	
	Start Microsoft System Information for a second time and the sound settings will
	return to normal.
