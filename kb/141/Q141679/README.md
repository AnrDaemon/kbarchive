	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 1.1c 
	- Apple Macintosh System Software 7.1.2 and later 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are running Creative Writer on a Macintosh with Apple Macintosh System
	Software version 7.1.2 or later, and you attempt to drag a file from the Library
	wall to the Portfolio Rack, the drive on which you are attempting to copy the
	file is not highlighted. As a result, the file cannot be copied to the desired
	drive.
	
	To place your files on a disk, you should save them directly to the disk, rather
	than use the Library.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the following steps to save files directly to a disk from within Creative
	Writer for the Macintosh:
	
	1. In Creative Writer, open the file that you want to save to another disk.
	
	2. Press "SHIFT+COMMAND+A" (without the quotation marks) to go to the Control
	  Room. Click OK.
	
	3. On the File menu, click Save As.
	
	4. Choose a name for your document and use the standard Macintosh list box to
	  navigate to the desired disk.
	
	5. Click Save.
