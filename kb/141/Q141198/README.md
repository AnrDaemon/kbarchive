	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a map from the Atlas in Bookshelf 1994 to the Hewlett- Packard
	(HP) DeskJet 1200c using the printer driver version 3.40, three copies of the
	map will print on each page. Each map printed on the page is lighter than the
	previous one. Also note, the printed images are normal width, but are only
	one-third of their normal height.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, use any of the following methods:
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	1. Click the Atlas icon and select a map.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Copy Picture.
	
	3. Paste the picture into Microsoft Paintbrush (or into Paint if you are using
	  Windows 95).
	
	4. Save the picture as a bitmap.
	
	5. Print the picture from Paintbrush (or from Paint if you are using Windows
	  95).
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	Install the HP DeskJet 500 printer driver.
	
	For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
	printed documentation or online Help.
