	installed, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
	
	2. On the Configuration tab, click Add, click the type of component you want to
	  add, and then click Add.
	
	3. Click the appropriate manufacturer and model for the component you are
	  adding, and then click OK. If there is no driver for the component you are
	  adding, click Have Disk and install the driver from a disk supplied by the
	  manufacturer of the component.
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	5. If you want to add other components, repeat steps 2-4.
	
	Changing Computer Name or Workgroup Name

	Choosing Share-Level or User-Level Security

	is installed, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
	
	2. Click the Access Control tab.
	
	3. Click either the Share-Level Access Control or the User-Level Access Control
	  option. If you choose the User-Level Access Control option, you must specify
	  a server in the "Obtain list of users and groups from" box from which a list
	  of users can be obtained.
	
	  NOTE: You should choose user-level access control only if there is a Microsoft
	  Windows NT workstation, Windows NT server, or Novell NetWare server on the
	  network.
