	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to create an online form using form fields. A form is
	a template or document with empty areas in which to collect and organize
	information. An online form uses form fields, which may include text boxes to
	fill in, check boxes to select or clear, and drop-down list boxes that contain
	lists of items from which to select choices.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To create an online form, follow these steps:
	
	1. Create a template.
	
	  a. On the File menu, click New.
	
	  b. Click the General tab. Select Blank Document.
	
	  c. Select the Template option under Create New, and click OK.
	
	2. Lay out the form. Include any text, tables, or graphics that you want to
	  appear in the form.
	
	3. Insert the form fields.
	
	  a. Position the insertion point where you want the user to type or select
	     information.
	
	  b. On the View menu, point to Toolbars and then click Forms. The Forms
	     toolbar appears.
	
	  c. Click the appropriate form field button on the Forms toolbar.
	
	  d. To specify the options of the form field, double-click the form field; or
	     right-click the form field and then click Properties. Select the options
	     you want to use.
	
	  e. Repeat steps a-d for each form field you want to add to your form.
	
	  NOTE: Each type of form field is described in the following table.
	
	   Type        Description
	   ------------------------------------------------------------
	
	   Text        Use a regular text form field when the form
	               requires an entry of any type, including text,
	               numbers, dates, current date and time, or
	               calculations. You can specify a default entry
	               so that the user does not have to type an
	               entry except to change the response.
	
	   Check Box   Use a check box to prompt the user for a yes
	               or no response.
	
	   Drop-Down   Use the drop-down form fields to provide the
	               user with a list of answers to choose from.
	               Selecting from a list rather than typing
	               entries makes it easier for users to fill in
	               the form correctly.
	
	4. Protect the document.
	
	  a. On the Tools menu, click Protect Document.
	
	  b. Click Forms, and then click OK.
	
	     Word protects the template from changes so users can enter information only
	     in the form fields.
	
	5. Save and close the template.
	
	NOTE: You can save the template to any folder. However, to use the template when
	you click New on the File menu, save the template to the Templates folder
	located in one of the following locations by default:
	
	Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98:
	
	  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates
	
	Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98 with Profiles Enabled and Microsoft
	Windows NT:
	
	  C:\windows_folder\Profiles\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates
	
	Microsoft Windows 2000:
	
	  C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates
	
	where username is the name of the user logged on to Windows and windowsfolder is
	the name of your Windows folder.
	
	How to Update the Fields
	------------------------
	
	Templates containing calculations as the type of text field require that you
	update the fields. To do this, use any of the following methods.
	
	Method 1: Use Calculate on Exit:
	
	Use the Calculate On Exit option in the Form Field Options dialog box.
	
	Method 2: Use a Macro:
	
	Assign a macro to the calculation text field to automatically update the field.
	
	Method 3: Use the Update Fields Option:
	
	To have Word update all fields when the document is printed, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Tools menu, click Options.
	
	2. Click the Print tab and then click to select the Update Fields check box.
	
	3. Click OK.
