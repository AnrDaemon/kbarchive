	INTRODUCTION TO FW1223
	----------------------
	
	A builder is a tool provided by Visual FoxPro for Windows to assist users in the
	design of objects. The tool presents a series of choices that set properties
	used in building an object. A builder allows you to quickly design a form by
	simplifying the process of setting properties for controls. A builder is similar
	in concept to a Wizard. Both are essential components of Rapid Application
	Development (RAD), but they differ in their implementation. The goal of a Wizard
	is to take you step by step through a process to accomplish a common task,
	whereas a builder lets you adjust the attributes of existing objects at design
	time.
	
	Visual FoxPro ships with 10 predefined builders: the Edit Box builder, the Option
	Group builder, the List Box builder, the Grid builder, the Form builder, the
	Combo Box builder, the Command Group builder, the AutoFormat builder, the Text
	Box builder, and the Referential Integrity builder. You can call a builder
	interactively from the shortcut menu in the Form Designer or the Visual Class
	designer, the Builder button in the Property sheet, or the Builder Lock button
	in the Form Control toolbar. You can also call the builder from the Command
	window with a DO command. To set preferences for the Builder Lock button, click
	the Forms tab in the Options dialog box.
	
	In addition to providing these existing builders, Visual FoxPro offers an open
	architecture that allows a developer to register and develop new custom
	builders.
