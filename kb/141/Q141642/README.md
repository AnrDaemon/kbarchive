	Article: Q141642
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
	Version(s): MACINTOSH:1.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the Help menu to open a window, no window is displayed. All
	subsequent attempts to open a window cause the computer to beep.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Dangerous Creatures was designed to center certain windows on the main window.
	This can be a problem when the main window is off the screen because the
	centered windows are also off the screen.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, do the following:
	
	1. Press RETURN.
	
	2. Move the window back to a normal on-screen position.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The window centered off the screen, along with the main window, contains an OK
	button. You can't perform any function until the OK button clicked and the
	Troubleshooting window closes.
	
	When you press the RETURN key, the program interprets the action the same way it
	would if you clicked. The Troubleshooting window closes.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dangerous Creatures version 1.0.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
