	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Encarta 1995, when you attempt to use the Copy or Print features from the
	"Further Reading" section of an article, the functionality is not available.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Copy and Print options are unavailable in the Further Reading section of an
	Encarta 1995 for the Macintosh article.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To print the Further Reading section in an Encarta 1995 article, do the
	following:
	
	1. Open the Further Reading window.
	
	2. Press the SHIFT+APPLE+3 key combination.
	
	  NOTE: The SHIFT+APPLE+3 key combination takes a picture of the screen and
	  places the capture in a file located on your hard disk. The file is named
	  Picture, followed by a number which corresponds to the number of pictures
	  taken. In this example the file name is referred to as Picture 1.
	
	3. Open a program that recognizes graphic files, such as Microsoft Works, and
	  open the Picture 1 file from within the program.
	
	4. Print the image from within the program you have chosen.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	The problem is corrected in Microsoft Encarta for the Macintosh, 1996 and later
