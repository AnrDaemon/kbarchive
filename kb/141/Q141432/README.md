	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you are using Microsoft Wine Guide on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT
	Workstation version 3.51 or 4.0 beta 2, videos included in Wine Guide may
	perform poorly, even if the system has sufficient RAM memory and enough
	available hard disk space.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	There is no known resolution to this problem.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Wine Guide for
	Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.0a and 2.0. We are researching this problem and will
	post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
	available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Generally, the audio plays smoothly, but the video skips (that is, it misses)
	frames. The videos do not actually start and stop, indicating problems with the
	speed of your computer or CD-ROM drive.
	
	The videos included in the Wine Guide compact disc are not individual files and
	cannot be played outside of Wine Guide.
