## Q141986: XCLN: Status Bar Indicator Does Not Update in Filter View

	Article: Q141986

	Version(s): 4.00
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you apply a filter to a Microsoft Exchange Windows client via the Filter
	option from the View menu, the status bar indicator that shows the number of
	items and unread messages does not adjust to the correct values. It still shows
	the total number of items and unread messages in that folder before the filter
	was applied.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by product design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can determine whether a filter is active by looking at the status bar
	located at the bottom of the client screen. If the status bar is not visible,
	choose Status Bar from the View menu. Then, you will see a status bar indicating
	the number of items and unread items. If a filter is active, you will also see a
	Funnel icon on the status bar.
