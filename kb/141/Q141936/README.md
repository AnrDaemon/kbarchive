	IMPORTING TEXT
	--------------
	
	Creative Writer can import plain text files saved from other programs. To import
	text into Creative Writer, the file must be saved from the original program as
	plain text.
	
	Text cannot be imported directly into the Moosepaper, Cardvark, or the
	Banneroceros wizards.
	
	To import text into your Moosepaper, use the following steps:
	
	1. Go to the Writing Studio.
	
	2. In the Writing Studio, click on McZee's Bag, then click the Portfolio.
	
	3. If you know the name of the file, click RatDog and type the name of the file,
	  then click Find It Ratdog.
	
	  If you don't know the name of the file, under Contents, use the arrows to
	  scroll down to Outside of Imaginopolis. Click Yes, keep looking.
	
	4. When the file has been found, select the name and click Go.
	
	5. Click the Page Format tool, then select the number of columns for your
	  newspaper.
	
	6. Click the Text tool, and then the Shape tool to create a title for your
	  newspaper.
	
	To import text into the Cardvark or Banneroceros wizards:
	
	1. In the original program, highlight the text that you want to import into
	  Creative Writer.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.
	
	3. In Creative Writer, go to the Projects floor, select the Banneroceros or
	  Cardvark, then when the card is on the screen, place the cursor where you
	  want the text to be. You may need to press the ENTER key to move to where you
	  want to place the text.
	
	4. Click the Scissors/Glue tool, then click the Glue tool to paste it into the
	  document. Once it's in Creative Writer, use the Text tool to format the text.
