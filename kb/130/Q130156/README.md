## Q130156: PPT: Some PowerPoint Buttons Not Available in Office Binder

	Article: Q130156
	Product(s): Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:7.0,97; Win95:7.0

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view a PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 presentation in an Office
	for Windows 95, version 7.0 binder, the presentation design status box as well
	as the New Slide and Slide Layout buttons are not available. These buttons are
	normally found at the bottom of the PowerPoint screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This interface is by design. Office 7.0 binders are OLE clients designed to
	provide a common interface and storage area for project- specific data. Binders
	are not designed to provide absolute, full functionality in each of the server
	applications.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	All the buttons that are not visible in the Binder have menu equivalents, so no
	functionality is lost.
