	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When you use Arcada Backup Exec version 5.0 in Windows NT version 3.5 and
	it encounters a corrupt NTFS directory, the Backup Exec program terminates
	without completing the entire backup. When a corrupt NTFS directory is
	encountered using Backup Exec version 5.0 in Windows NT version 3.51, a Dr.
	Watson error message appears.
	
	To correct this problem, upgrade to Arcada Backup Exec version 6.0. The new
	Backup Exec version skips the corrupt directory and proceeds with the next
	directory. For additional information, contact Arcada Software at
	(800) 327-2232.
	
	Backup Exec is manufactured by Arcada Software, Inc., a vendor independent

	product's performance or reliability.
