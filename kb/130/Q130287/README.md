	=======
	
	When you install Microsoft Word for Windows NT, Word makes available to Windows

	menu. By default, all the options for the spell-checking tool are disabled.
	
	The options for spell-checking in Word for Windows NT are:
	
	- Always suggest replacements for misspelled words.
	
	- Always check spelling before sending.
	
	You can select certain words for the spell-checking tool to ignore:
	
	- Words in uppercase letters.
	
	- Words with numbers.

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Exchange for Windows 95 does not include a spell-checking tool.
	However, Microsoft Exchange can use any 32-bit spell-checking tool that is
	correctly registered. Microsoft Exchange cannot use 16-bit spell-checking tools
	unless they are written specifically for Microsoft Exchange.
	
	The Microsoft Mail client also does not supply a spell-checking tool, but it can
	use any correctly registered spell-checking tool.
