	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
	include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
	"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
	address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
	contains specific information for working around problems.
	
	Disk 2 Doesn't Work on Windows-Based Computers
	----------------------------------------------
	
	The Word 6 Developer's Kit comes with two disks. Although Disk 1 is installed
	correctly, Disk 2 is not recognized as a formatted disk on a Windows-based
	computer.
	
	Correction:
	
	The disk labels for both disks should be changed as follows:
	
	- On Disk 1: Change "Disk 1 of 2" to "Disk 1 for the PC."
	
	- On Disk 2: Change "Disk 2 of 2" to "Disk 1 for the Mac."
	
	Comments:
	
	Only the first disk is formatted for Windows-based computers. The second disk is
	formatted only for Macintosh computers, and should not be installed on a
	Windows-based computer.
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
