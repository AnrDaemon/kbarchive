	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On MIPS computers, the Windows NT subsystem for 16-bit MS-DOS or Windows 3.1
	applications terminates when you print from Quicken version 4.0 to a local
	postscript printer. This problem usually occurs when a macro executes the print
	command from Quicken at computer speed; it is unlikely to occur if you execute
	the print command manually.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
	version 3.51.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
	problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
	version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
