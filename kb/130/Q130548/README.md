	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A tentative appointment does not show in the Date Navigator or in the Planner.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When an appointment is scheduled as tentative, it appears as normal in the
	Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views. It will not show in the Date Navigator as a
	bold date. Also, it will not show in the Planner view as scheduled time.
	
	This is by product design.
