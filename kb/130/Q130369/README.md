	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Windows 95, you may experience problems with the visibility of
	certain screen elements (such as selected commands on a menu).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows 95 inherits the color scheme from the previous version of Windows.
	However, the default menu color is changed to gray (instead of white). If the
	previous color scheme uses gray as the color for selected menu items, there is
	no difference in appearance between selected and non-selected items on a menu.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this situation, follow these steps:
	
	1. Use the right mouse button to click the desktop and then click Properties on
	  the menu that appears.
	
	2. Click the Appearance tab.
	
	3. Click a scheme in the Color Scheme box, or click Selected Items in the Item
	  box and then click another color.
	
	4. Click OK.
