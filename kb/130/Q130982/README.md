	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Clix mouse may not work in Windows 95 Setup. The Clix mouse may also not
	work in Windows 95 after Setup is finished.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Clix mouse loads a real-mode driver that is not supported by the VMOUSE
	driver. When you run Setup from an MS-DOS prompt, Setup may not detect the Clix
	mouse and driver.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the standard mouse type to use the Clix mouse in two-button mode.
	
	To use the Clix mouse in three-button mode, you may need to contact the mouse
	manufacturer for a driver upgrade.
