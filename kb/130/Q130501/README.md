	================
	
	The following information discusses search methods for use with Encarta and
	Bookshelf.
	
	Searching with Encarta 1994 or 1995
	-----------------------------------
	
	The Topic Titles Only search looks for a matching title. If it finds an exact
	match, it displays the article. If not, it puts the highlighted word from Works
	in the text box of the Encarta Pinpointer (1995) or the Contents dialog box
	(1994) and lists article titles starting with the closest match.
	
	The Topics search lists all Encarta articles with the selected word anywhere
	within the body of the article.
	
	NOTE: When you do a Topics search in Encarta 1995, it may appear that the search
	wasn't performed. However, if you click the Word button in Pinpointer, the word
	appears.

	beginning with the desired word or closest match, and displays the article with
	the closest match.
	
	The Topics search searches all books and lists all articles with the selected
	word anywhere within the body of the article, and displays the first article
	listed.
