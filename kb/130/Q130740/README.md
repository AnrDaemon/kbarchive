	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you design forms or reports in Microsoft Access version 2.0, you can use a
	border size called hairline that is smaller than 1-point. In Windows NT, the
	hairline borders do not print on the Hewlett-Packard (HP) 4 series printers.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To temporarily work around this problem, use the HP II series printer drivers.
	If you use the HP III series printer drivers, dots are printed in place of the
	hairline border.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Access version 2.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
