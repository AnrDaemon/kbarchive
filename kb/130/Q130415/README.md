	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you start Microsoft Golf 2.0 for Windows, you may receive the following
	error message:
	
	  Crucial Files Missing
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This message occurs because the player profile setting does not recognize any
	extended keyboard characters or any foreign keyboard characters.
	
	Setup allows use of extended characters (for example foreign accent marks) during
	initial setup, but after setup they cause the above error message because player
	profile doesn't recognize extended characters.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct the problem, you must obtain a new set of Golf disks, delete your
	Golf directory, and reinstall the program without using extended characters in
	the name fields. For more information about how to perform these tasks in
	Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.
	
	To obtain new or updated Microsoft products, call the Microsoft Sales Information
	Center at (800) 426-9400. International customers should see Microsoft's World
	Wide Offices Web site at:

	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Golf version 2.0 for Windows.
