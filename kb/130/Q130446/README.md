	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the Whatsits in Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System to
	play games, the program may stop responding (hang).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may be caused by one of the following:
	
	- You use the Microsoft Natural Keyboard with the Keyboard Sounds function
	  turned on (enabled).
	- You have a problem with your video display driver.
	
	WORKAROUNDS
	-----------
	
	Use one of the following two methods to work around the problem.
	
	Problems using the Microsoft Natural Keyboard
	---------------------------------------------
	
	If you are using the Microsoft Natural Keyboard with the software supplied, make
	sure you turn off (disable) the Keyboard Sounds function. Please follow the
	steps below:
	
	1. Open Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the Keyboard icon.
	
	3. Select Sounds Off on the Options tab.
	
	Video Driver Problems
	---------------------
	
	Make sure your video driver is a current version.
	
	If you are using a video chipset compatible with standard Super VGA drivers,
	change your display driver to Super VGA 640x480, 256 colors.
	
	NOTE: Before you make changes to your display driver, always make a copy of the
	SYSTEM.INI file, located in the WINDOWS directory. For more information about
	how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or
	online Help.
	
	For a list of video cards that are compatible with SVGA, please see the following
	article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	Microsoft Super VGA series of drivers.
