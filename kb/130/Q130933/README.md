	Administrators are granted a licensed connection to a server running in the
	Per Server mode even though the new connection will exceed the number of
	available licenses on that server. This is to ensure that administrators
	can access servers at all times.
	
	NOTE: If a normal user is connected to the server and they close their
	connection, another connection will not be issued until a legal license is
	freed.
