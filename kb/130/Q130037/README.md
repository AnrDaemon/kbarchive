	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In versions 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when you attempt
	to add Personal Address List (PAL) groups to the Personal Address Book (PAB),
	you get the following error:
	
	  Personal Address List groups cannot be added to the Personal Address Book."
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You must create a new Personal Group, and then add the members. Members may be
	added from the PAL as follows:
	
	1. From the Mail menu, choose Personal Groups.
	
	2. From the Personal Groups dialog box, click New to create a new Personal
	  Group. From the New Group dialog box, type in the New Group Name, and click
	  the Create button.
	
	3. You can alternatively add the PAL members to an existing Personal Group by
	  selecting the personal group from the list and then clicking the Edit button.
	
	4. From the Personal Groups - "<group name>" dialog box, click the daybook
	  icon in the upper-left corner.
	
	5. From the Open Directory dialog box, double-click the Personal Address List.
	
	6. Click the Personal Address List group (bolded text) to select it, then click
	  the Details button.
	
	7. Select the PAL group members to be added to the Personal Address Group.
	
	Notes:
	
	- All of the entries can be selected at once by highlighting the first entry in
	  the range, then holding the SHIFT key and the cursor (cursor keys or mouse)
	  to select the end of the range, either up or down.
	
	- Selected multiple entries can be added together by holding the CTRL key and
	  clicking the entries with the mouse.
