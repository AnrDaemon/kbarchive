	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you lock your local workstation using CTRL+ALT+DEL, and then an administrator
	logs you off of that machine locally (using CTRL+ALT+DEL), the desktop becomes
	active for approx. 5-10 seconds (depending on what processes are active, etc.).
	During this time, the administrator can see the desktop, any open files, and can
	even manipulate objects on the desktop.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
	done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.
