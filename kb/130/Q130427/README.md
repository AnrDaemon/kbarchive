	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The start time for a task is set to 12:00 A.M. (midnight) on the start date
	of the task. This is set by default and cannot be changed.
	
	The start time only affects a task when you set a reminder for that task.
	You can set a reminder to pop up a specific number of hours or a specific
	number of minutes before the start time of the task. Because the start time
	of a task is always 12:00 A.M., setting a reminder for 3 hours before start
	time causes the reminder to be displayed at 9:00 P.M.
