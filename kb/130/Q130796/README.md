	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to set up a new internal modem using the Install New Modem Wizard,
	the COM port for that modem may not be listed as an available port.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows 95 does not detect the hardware in your computer each time you restart
	it. The new COM port has not yet been detected.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To detect the new COM port, run the Add New Hardware Wizard. To do so, follow
	these steps:
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon.
	
	3. Follow the instructions in the Add New Hardware Wizard.
	
	After the new COM port is detected and you restart the computer, you can set up
	the internal modem.
