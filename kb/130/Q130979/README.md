	SYMPTOMS

	If you do not have a home directory defined for your account in User Manager for
	Domains and you log on, Windows NT incorrectly sets your user environment
	variables before the default home directory environment variable is set.
	
	However, if you have a home directory defined in User Manager for Domains and you
	log on, Windows NT correctly sets your home directory environment variable
	before your user environment variables.

	version 3.51.
