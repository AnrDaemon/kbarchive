	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Mail for PC Networks uses data encryption technology to provide
	security on many of the data files found in the postoffice database. Examples of
	the files that are encrypted are all .MAI, .ATT, .CAL, and .MMF files, as well
	as password fields in the MASTER.GLB and ACCESS.GLB files. Encrypting these
	files prevents anyone from dumping their contents and openly viewing the
	information contained in the file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The data encryption algorithm employed by Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, while
	being proprietary, is NSA (National Security Agency) approved.
	
	Microsoft Mails data encryption technique is similar to the Data Encryption
	Standard (DES) as designed by the National Bureau of Standards; however, unlike
	DES, the data encryption technology employed by Microsoft Mail is exportable
	outside the United States.
