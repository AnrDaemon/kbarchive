	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You can add a secondary time zone by choosing Options on the Tools menu and
	clicking the Time Zone tab. This will allow you to view your schedule as someone
	in another time zone would.
	
	When you add a secondary time zone, the default is Pacific Time. It will not
	default to the Primary Time Zone setting.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Defaulting to Pacific Time is by design.
