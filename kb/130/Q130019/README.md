	Article: Q130019

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In the Microsoft Exchange Windows clients, you can drag and drop names between
	the To, Cc, and Bcc boxes. However, when you do so, no separator (semicolon) is
	included between the names in the destination field.
	
	NOTE: Previously resolved names are re-resolved correctly and the separator is
	added when you perform another Check Names.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
	4.0 Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT clients. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
	becomes available.
