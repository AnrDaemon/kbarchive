	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To enter Japanese characters using a standard U.S. keyboard on a localized
	Japanese version of Windows NT, you must use an Input Method Editor (IME).
	
	IME provides several different methods of entering Hiragana, Hurigana, Katakana,
	Kanji, and Romaji characters using Microsoft IME, WX2, VJ2, and ATOK7. The
	Microsoft IME input method is used by default. To change the default input
	method, run Microsoft IME from the Program Manager "Nihon go jin ka" group.
	
	To invoke IME, you must use the key combination ALT+~ or ALT+` to launch 4
	applications (located in the lower right hand corner on your desktop). These
	applications provide several Japanese characters you can enter into your
	document. To disable IME, you must use the same key combination of ALT+ ~ or
	ALT+ ` again.
