	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view a recurring task in the To Do list, the date that is displayed in
	the End Date column is not the end date of the series of recurring tasks; It is
	the end date of that individual task.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by product design.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To find the End Date of the complete series, click Edit Recurring on the Edit
	menu. Then click Tasks and double-click the task to be viewed.
