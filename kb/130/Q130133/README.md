	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view pictures from the Gallery, and you choose Copy Picture from the
	Edit menu, you are unable to paste the picture caption into other applications.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Try one of the following workarounds.
	
	Workaround 1
	------------
	
	Press ALT+PRINT SCREEN to copy the entire screen, which includes the picture and
	caption, to the Clipboard. When a screen image is pasted from the Windows
	Clipboard into Paintbrush, part of the image may be cropped off. Paintbrush
	displays only the part of the image that fills the work area.
	
	To paste the entire captured image from the Clipboard into Paintbrush:
	
	1. Start Paintbrush.
	
	2. From the Options menu, choose Image Attributes and select Default.
	
	3. From the View menu, choose Zoom Out.
	
	4. From the Edit menu, choose Paste. A grid effect appears.
	
	5. From the Edit menu, choose Paste again. The Picture reappears with a
	  superimposed grid over the top.
	
	6. From the View menu, choose Picture to verify that the entire image has been
	  pasted. Click the Picture anywhere to return to the previous view.
	
	7. From the View menu, choose Zoom In.
	
	The entire image is now pasted into the window work area.
	
	Workaround 2
	------------
	
	Copy the entire screen, which includes the picture and caption, to the
	Clipboard.
	
	To paste the entire captured image from the Clipboard into a word processor,
	choose Paste from the Edit menu of the word processor.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf 1995. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
