	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the Have Disk button you can select only the first information
	(.INF) file in a folder.
	
	For example, this occurs when you click Have Disk when you are adding or removing
	programs, or adding a network component, or adding a printer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Browse feature is used only to determine the path to the software, not the
	specific name of the .INF file for the software.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Continue with the operation. You will receive a list of all the programs that
	can be installed or removed from all the .INF files in the directory.
