	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
	include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
	"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
	address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
	contains specific information for working around problems.
	
	Page 187: Unknown Reference "Windows NT Server Remote Access"
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The last paragraph on page 187 refers to "Windows NT Server Remote Access
	Service." However, this section does not make it clear whether this document is
	part of the NT Resource Kit, a separate document, or part of the Windows NT
	documentation.
	
	Correction:
	
	Change
	
	  see Windows NT Server Remote Access Service
	
	to
	
	  see the Windows NT Server Remote Access Service book included with Windows NT
	  Server (also included in the Windows NT Server Books Online).
	
	Page 389: Telnet Server Referenced But Not Included
	---------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 389, at the end of the paragraph under "Publishing Tools," there is a
	reference to "the Telnet Server." However, no such utility is included with
	Windows NT or the Resource Kit.
	
	Comments:
	
	The Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit was initially scheduled to include an Internet
	Server program; however, the utility was not included with this edition. This
	reference to the Internet Server was not removed in the first printing of this
	book.
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
