	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows NT Server 3.5 CD-ROM supplied by Original Equipment Manufacturers
	(OEMs) may not contain the \CLIENTS\WFW subdirectory.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.5 CD-ROM product contains \CLIENTS\WFW and
	\CLIENTS\WFW\UPDATE directories. The update directory is referred to in the
	CD-ROM's README.TXT file regarding updating installed Windows for Workgroups
	clients. These directories and software were omitted from OEM CD- ROMs because
	of licensing requirements. In the future, OEM CD-ROMs will contain these
	directories, but without the full set of Windows for Workgroups client software.
