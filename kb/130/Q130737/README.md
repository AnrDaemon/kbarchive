	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Microsoft Access, forms and reports can be created with text titles, headers,
	and columns. For each of these individual text fields, Microsoft Access
	associates properties for them. One such property is called Text Align, and its
	purpose is to align text within its field boundaries (left align, right align,
	and center).
