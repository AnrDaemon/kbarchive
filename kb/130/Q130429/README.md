	An appointment less than 5 minutes in length may be difficult to see in the
	Planner view.
	
	If an appointment is scheduled for one minute, it appears as normal in the
	Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views. However, it is very difficult to see in
	the Planner view. If you set the Appointment Book time scale to a 30 or 60
	minute increment, the appointment is almost invisible in the Planner.
	
	In the Planner view, each appointment is displayed to scale. Therefore, if
	you use a large time scale to view an entry scheduled for less than 5
	minutes, it may be difficult to see.
