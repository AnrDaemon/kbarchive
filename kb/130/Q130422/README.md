	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The scripts to install Systems Management Server on a computer (SMSLS.BAT and
	RUNSMS.BAT) depend on having a certain amount of environment space available.
	Without creating environment variables it would be very difficult for Systems
	Management Server to support the various operating systems which it does.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the necessary space is not available when the script is started, the script
	will attempt to create a new command shell with additional free space, and make
	another attempt to execute the script file (there are safeguards against extra
	recursion). This is accomplished by a command similar to:
	
	     command /e:2048 /c %0\..\smsls.bat
	
	This implementation works for all the operating systems that typically experience
	this problem (MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 95).
	
	If the new command shell is needed, Out of Environment Space messages may be
	generated by the operating system; these are not errors. If SMSLS.BAT is called
	from within a logon script and this message occurs, it can be eliminated by
	calling SMSLS.BAT with a command similar to:
	
	     call command /e:2048 /c %0\..\smsls.bat
