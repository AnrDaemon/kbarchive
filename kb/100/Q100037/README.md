	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Read Me file included with the Mail server will not print beyond page 2 on
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet series printers. However, no error message is
	displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by a long sentence at the beginning of the third page
	that the LaserJet cannot correctly interpret when using TeachText.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correctly print the Read Me file, print to any Apple brand printer or copy
	the text from the TeachText application into any word- processing program and
	then print.
