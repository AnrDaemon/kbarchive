	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Two or three *.TMP files may be left in your TEMP directory when you exit
	Windows after performing a search in one of the above applications. This occurs
	if you exit Windows without first closing the application. If you are using
	Multimedia Viewer 1.0, three TMP files will be left on your hard drive. If you
	are using Multimedia Viewer 2.0, there will be two TMP files left on your hard
	drive.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Multimedia Viewer versions 1.0
	and 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
