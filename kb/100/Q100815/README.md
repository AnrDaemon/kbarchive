	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	FoxCentral's default directory setting does not affect the FoxBASE+ default
	directory.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	FoxBASE+/LAN interacts differently with FoxCentral than the single-user product
	does. When FoxCentral is called from the LAN version, a dialog box asks for a
	default drive and directory. This drive and directory is where FoxCentral's work
	files (CENTRAL.ADX and CENTRAL.DBM) will be located. This location has no
	bearing on the default drive and directory specified for FoxBASE+. The default
	drive and directory for FoxBASE+ are specified through FoxCentral's menu.
