	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The unprintable regions of a page are regions where the printer cannot print
	because they are outside the margins allowed by a particular Windows printer
	driver. These regions are set either automatically (by design) or manually (by
	the user) in the printer driver.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If the unprintable region is set automatically, it cannot be changed. If the
	unprintable region is set manually, some printer drivers allow you to set the
	margins allowed as follows:
	
	Windows 3.1 and 3.11
	--------------------
	
	1. In the Printer Setup dialog box, choose Options, then choose Margins.
	
	2. Adjust the margins as necessary and choose OK.
	
	Windows 3.0 and 3.0a
