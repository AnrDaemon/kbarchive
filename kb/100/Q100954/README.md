	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) OmniBook 300 ships with MS-DOS 5.0 preinstalled on
	Flash read-only memory (ROM). The OmniBook, however, does not contain the full
	retail version of MS-DOS.
	
	Microsoft modified each product to operate on Flash ROM; these are not full
	retail releases of the Microsoft products. In addition to the Flash ROM releases
	of these Microsoft products, each OmniBook 300 owner is licensed to use the full
	releases of the products.
