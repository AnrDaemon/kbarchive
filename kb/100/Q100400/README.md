	- Microsoft Musical Instruments for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you switch away from Musical Instruments, any open pop-up windows will
	disappear. For example, if you have a pop-up window on the screen and then
	choose the Finder, the pop-up window disappears. The pop-up window does not
	reappear when you click on Musical Instruments again.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Musical Instruments for the
	Macintosh, version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
