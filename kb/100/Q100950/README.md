	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you are running the Hanna-Barbera sound schemes "Boinks, Splats, &
	Zips" or "'Toon Talks," you may receive a general protection (GP) fault if you
	rapidly minimize and/or maximize many windows one after the other. These sound
	schemes assign sounds to the actions of maximizing and minimizing windows.
	Playing these sounds in very rapid succession may lead to the following error
	message:
	
	  Application Error
	  PROGMAN caused a GPF in module MVPROAUD.DRV at 0001:0A21
	
	This problem does not occur if you are using version 1.2 or later of the
	MediaVision sound board driver (MVPROAUD.DRV).
	
	To obtain updated drivers, contact MediaVision technical support at (510)
	770-9905. You also can connect to the MediaVision bulletin board service (BBS)
	at (510) 770-0968.
