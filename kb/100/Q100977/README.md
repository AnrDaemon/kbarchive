	If you are running Windows for Workgroups Mail or Microsoft Mail for Windows,
	version 3.0 and you choose Shared Folders, you can no longer view the Inbox.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In both Mail products, there are two types of folders: shared and private. Only
	one type of folder can be viewed at a time. When you view the shared folder, the
	Inbox does not appear because it is a part of the private folder. When you
	choose Window on the menu bar, only two commands appear on the list, Outbox and
	Shared Folder.
	
	To retrieve the Inbox, do one of the following:
	
	- From the View menu, choose Private Folders.
	
	  -or-
	
	- From the View menu, choose Open Inbox. (CTRL+G also opens the Inbox.)
	
	  -or-
	
	- From the Window menu, choose New Window.
