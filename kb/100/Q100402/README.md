## Q100402: Musical Instruments: Annotation Disturbs Line Spacing

	Article: Q100402

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Musical Instruments for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you choose Annotate from the Help menu in Musical Instruments Help, a
	dialog box appears in which you can type your own notes about the selected Help
	topic. When you choose the Save button, a paperclip icon appears at the top of
	the Help entry to indicate that you have added an annotation.
	
	In Musical Instruments, the paperclip icon pushes down the first line of text so
	that it partially overlaps the text on the second line. The text is still
	readable, but the line spacing is incorrect.
	
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
