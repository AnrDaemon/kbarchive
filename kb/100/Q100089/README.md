	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	An early release of the updated Microsoft Anti-Virus and Microsoft Anti-Virus
	for Windows engine files (available from Central Point Software) created
	CHKLIST.CPS files instead of CHKLIST.MS files. As a result, you cannot delete
	these files with the Delete CHKLST Files option in Microsoft Anti-Virus and
	Microsoft Anti-Virus for Windows.
	
	If you want to delete the CHKLIST.CPS files, run MS-DOS Shell or Windows File
	Manager, search on CHKLIST.CPS (starting from the root directory), and delete
	the files.
