	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The audio clips of quotations in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations may not always
	exactly match the related texts.
	
	For example, in the poem "Fog" [1916] by Carl Sandburg, the audio clip of the
	poet reading does not match the printed quotation.
	
	The quotation appears on the screen as follows:
	
	  ...It sits looking
	  over the harbor and city...
	
	In the audio clip, however, Mr. Sandburg says the following:
	
	  ...It sits looking
	  over city and harbor...
	
	Mr. Sandburg misread his own poem, and no other recording of his voice reading
	was available to include with Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.
