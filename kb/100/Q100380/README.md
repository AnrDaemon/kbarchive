	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Pictures with more than 16 colors will not display properly when used in the
	JigSawed game that ships with Microsoft Entertainment Pack volume 2. JigSawed is
	a 16-color application. Consequently, images used in JigSawed should have equal
	to or less than 16 colors. Pictures with 256 colors or more will look
	unpleasant.
