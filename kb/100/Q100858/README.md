	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Cinemania, versions 1992 editions, 1994 editions 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The movie lists created by ListMaker in Cinemania cannot be copied and pasted
	into other applications or other lists.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Help file in Cinemania 1992 incorrectly states that "You can use ListMaker
	to create one or more lists of movies that you can copy, modify, and print."
	"Copy" should not be included in that sentence. (Note that the Help file in
	Cinemania 1994 is correct; however, the movie list behavior discussed above
	still exists in Cinemania 1994.)
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The only way to get an independent movie listing from ListMaker is by installing
	the Generic Text Only printer in Windows and setting it up to print to a file.
	When printed to a file, ListMaker can be opened to a word processor and
	modified.
