	Article: Q100984

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes two features of the clean start and interactive start
	function keys (F5 and F8, respectively) that are not documented in the "User's
	Guide." Because these features were added late in the product development cycle,
	this information does not appear in the "User's Guide."
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	As documented under "Bypassing CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Commands" on pages
	103-104 of the "User's Guide," you can use the F5 key to completely bypass your
	CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT commands, or you can use the F8 key to confirm each
	CONFIG.SYS command. You can also press and hold down the SHIFT key when MS-DOS
	displays the "Starting MS-DOS..." prompt to completely bypass your CONFIG.SYS
	and AUTOEXEC.BAT commands.
	
	Note: If you hold down the SHIFT key, you do NOT receive the following standard
	message displayed when you press F5:
	
	  MS-DOS is bypassing your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
	
	New Information
	---------------
	
	Once you have started selectively processing your CONFIG.SYS commands by pressing
	F8 (or CTRL+F8 in MS-DOS 6.2), you can respond "Yes" to all remaining prompts,
	including "Process AUTOEXEC.BAT [Y/N]?," by pressing ESC. Or, you can respond No
	to all remaining prompts, including "Process AUTOEXEC.BAT [Y/N]?," by pressing
	F5.
