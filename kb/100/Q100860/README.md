	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) OmniBook 300 contains DBLSPACE.EXE, which is taken from
	MS-DOS 6.0. The OmniBook implementation of DoubleSpace sets the uncompressed
	drive letter to drive E. Hewlett-Packard set drive E as the default; this
	default does not adhere to the MS-DOS 6.0 standard for setting DoubleSpace
	drives.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Hewlett-Packard chose this default to coordinate with internal OmniBook
	configurations, such as the use of Stacker on the Flash RAM. Note that the
	Stacker functions provided with the OmniBook 300 on Flash RAM always use drive F
	as the default for the uncompressed drive.
