	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Musical Instruments for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Musical Instruments icon may change from color to black and white when
	starting and while running Musical Instruments.
	
	
	The icons of other applications may also turn black and white when Musical
	Instruments is started. When you switch back to the desktop, however, the icons
	should return to their original colors.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This also occurs when running other applications, such as Adobe Photoshop. This
	occurs with any application that changes the System palette.
	
	When an application changes the palette, the Macintosh System checks to see if
	enough of the standard colors are still available to render the icon correctly
	in color. If there are not enough standard colors available, it draws the icon
	in black and white.
