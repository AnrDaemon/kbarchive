	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you install Encarta 1995 on a hard drive that does not contain the active
	system folder (non-startup drive), the installation may not install all the
	files to the appropriate locations.
	
	The problem is most noticeable on machines running System 7.0 or System 7.0.1
	system software.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	On System 7.0 and 7.0.1, installing Encarta to a drive without the active system
	folder doesn't properly install some necessary fonts. In some cases, the install
	program may not install Encarta at all to such a drive.
	
	To resolve these problems, install Encarta to your start-up hard drive. If you
	want Encarta on another hard drive, drag the Encarta folder to that drive when
	the install process is complete.
	
	For more information about this issue, see section six of the Encarta ReadMe
	file.
