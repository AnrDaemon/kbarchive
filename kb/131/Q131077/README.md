	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use the Forms Designer Hypercard Stack, included with version 3.1x of
	Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, you may not be able to create a new
	stack.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This will be the case if you are using the Hypercard Player to run the Forms
	Designer Stack. In order to create a new stack, you must be running the full
	version of Hypercard. Hypercard Player does not allow you to create or edit the
	Forms Designer Stacks.
