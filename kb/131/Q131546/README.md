	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you press the ALT+ENTER key combination in an MS-DOS prompt session, your
	computer may stop responding (hang). You must restart your computer to make the
	keyboard work again.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if you are using a Gateway AnyKey keyboard dated 6/18/91
	(part number 2189014-00-711).
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around the problem, use any one of the following methods:
	
	- Replace the AnyKey keyboard with a model not dated 6/18/91. For example,
	  AnyKey keyboards dated 3/9/92 and later have been found to work correctly.
	
	- Replace the AnyKey keyboard with a keyboard from a different manufacturer.
	
	- Do not press ALT+ENTER to switch between a windowed and full-screen MS-DOS
	  prompt session.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This problem does not occur in Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1x, and
