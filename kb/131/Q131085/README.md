	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you drag text from WordPad to Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows, the
	text is inserted as an object in Word. The text may not be visible in the object
	the first time you drag it to Word, but it is visible if you drag the text to
	Word again. If the text is not visible, double-clicking the object causes the
	text to appear and become editable.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Instead of dragging the text from WordPad to Word, copy the text in WordPad
	using the Copy command on the Edit menu. Then, paste the text into Word using
	the Paste command on the Edit menu in Word.
