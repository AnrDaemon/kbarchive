## Q131620: Filename Extension Remains .SC2 When Exporting

	Article: Q131620
	Product(s): Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
	Version(s): WINDOWS:7.0; Win95:7.0

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you export a Schedule+ file and choose the Save File As Type option from
	the browser, the filename extension remains .SC2, rather than changing to the
	file type chosen, such as *.SCH, *.TXT, or *.*.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by product design.
	
	When you export a Schedule+ file, the default export name is the user ID with the
	extension .SC2; for example, USERID.SC2.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you choose the Save File As Type option with the default filename in the
	filename box, you must modify the extension manually.
