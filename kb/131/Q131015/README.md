	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Individual users cannot create their own post office accounts in Microsoft
	Exchange in Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you create a Microsoft Exchange profile that includes Microsoft Mail, you
	are prompted for a path to the post office. A list of user accounts for that
	post office is then displayed. If your account is not displayed, you must
	contact the post office administrator to have an account created.
	
	Note that this behavior is different from that of the Microsoft Mail client
	included with Windows for Workgroups. In Microsoft Mail in Windows for
	Workgroups, you can set up your own post office account.
	
	Windows 95 post offices are created and managed using the Microsoft Workgroup
	Postoffice Admin tool included with Windows 95. To use this tool, double-click
	the Microsoft Mail Postoffice icon in Control Panel.
