	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. What is the difference between a message and a conversation?
	
	  A. A message is a single posting to a bulletin board (BBS); a conversation (or
	  thread) is a series of postings. For example, if you post a message and
	  someone replies to it, the two messages make up a conversation.
	
	2. Q. How can I expand an entire BBS conversation?
	
	  A. Hold down the SHIFT key while you click the plus sign (+) in front of the
	  conversation you want to expand. Or, click the first message in the
	  conversation and then press "+" on your keyboard.
	
	  To expand all conversations at once, click Expand All Conversations on the
	  View menu.
	
	3. Q. Can I read bulletin board messages offline?
	
	  A. There is no offline reader for The Microsoft Network. This feature is under
	  review and will be considered for inclusion in a future release.
	
	4. Q. Yesterday I saw and read a lot of messages on a bulletin board. Today when
	  I went back to the bulletin board all of the messages had disappeared. What
	  happened?
	
	  A. When you open a bulletin board, messages that you have already read are not
	  automatically displayed. To see previously read messages, click Show All
	  Messages on the Tools menu.
	
	5. Q. Does The Microsoft Network notify me if I have replies to bulletin board
	  messages I posted?
	
	  A. No. This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
	  future release.
	
	  You need to open the bulletin board in question and check for replies. You can
	  also place a shortcut to your message on your computer's desktop or in a
	  folder.
	
	6. Q. How can I delete a message I posted to a bulletin board?
	
	  A. You cannot. Only the bulletin board manager can delete posted messages.
	
	7. Q. When I post a message, how long does it take to show up on the bulletin
	  board?
	
	  A. Messages do not go to the bulletin board immediately when you post them.
	  They are sent to the BBS server and queued up for replication to the other
	  BBS servers. If the BBS servers are very busy or if the program that
	  processes the replication queue is shut down, it may take as long as several
	  minutes (or sometimes even hours) before you see messages you posted arrive
	  on the bulletin board. Ordinarily, it takes only a few seconds to replicate a
	  posting, but delays are possible.
	
	8. Q. Is it possible to have a signature automatically inserted in a bulletin
	  board message?
	
	  A. No. This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
	  future release.
	
	9. Q. Is it possible to automatically quote the message to which I am replying?
	
	  A. No. This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
	  future release.
