	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The logon script processor that is installed with the Microsoft Client for
	NetWare Networks displays an error message when an error occurs processing a MAP
	command, but does not display an error code.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Although the logon script processor user interface does not display the error
	code when a MAP command fails, an error code is generated. Therefore, this
	problem does not affect "IF ERRORLEVEL" statements or other commands that rely
	on error codes.
