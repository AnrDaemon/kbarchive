	Article: Q131090

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you filter messages in a public folder, the message count on the status bar
	indicates the total number of messages in the folder, not the number of messages
	that match the filter criteria.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In public folders, the message count only reflects the total number of messages
	in the folder; it does not reflect the number of messages currently displayed.
	
	NOTE: The same behavior is also displayed when you use the Find command (from the
	Tools menu).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
	4.0 Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT clients. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
	becomes available.
