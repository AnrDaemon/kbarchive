	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The CD-ROM optimization settings are available in the File System Properties
	dialog box even if there is no CD-ROM drive installed. When you change these
	settings, Windows 95 prompts you to restart the computer.
	
	If there is no CD-ROM drive installed, the CD-ROM file system driver (CDFS.VXD)
	does not remain in memory at startup and the CD-ROM optimization settings are
	not active. Changing these settings on a computer that does not have a CD-ROM
	drive installed does not affect the performance of Windows 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To modify the CD-ROM optimization settings on a computer that does have a CD-ROM
	drive installed, follow these steps:
	
	1. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click Properties on the
	  menu that appears.
	
	2. Click the Performance tab.
	
	3. Click the File System button.
