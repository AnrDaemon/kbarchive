	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Wine Guide for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
	- Microsoft Wine Guide for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Find tool in Microsoft Wine Guide finds only the first occurrence of a word
	on page. If you try to use Find Again to find more instances of that word on the
	page, the Find tool just skips to the next page.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In some programs, a word finder tool finds each occurrence of a specified word.
	In other programs, the word finder goes to the first match in each topic. Since
	Wine Guide is predominantly organized by pages, the second method was chosen for
	the Find tool.
	
	For more information about the Find tool, click the Help button, and then click
	the Find tab. Complete online instructions are included.
