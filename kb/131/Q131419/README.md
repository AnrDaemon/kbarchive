	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to gain keyboard access to the high ANSI characters
	(those above 128), which are the control characters, typically used in hot
	(access) keys.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You can use the left apostrophe (`) key to gain access to the control
	characters. You will usually find the left apostrophe (`) key in the upper-left
	corner of keyboard sharing a key with the tilde (~).
	
	For example, set the font for the Command window to FoxFont. Then press the left
	apostrophe ("`" (without the quotation marks)) key once followed by any other
	key on the keyboard (try "a"). You will get a smiley face for a character. If a
	font does not have extended characters, such as the Arial font, you will get a
	box.
	
	NOTE: to get the left apostrophe (`) character to show, you need to press the key
	twice.
	
	Although this does work on most systems, there have been reports that it does not
	work on some systems.
