	- Microsoft SourceSafe for Macintosh, versions 3.04, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The SourceSafe Macintosh product is a command-line-only tool. Therefore, the
	SourceSafe executables cannot be run from Finder; they must be run from
	Macintosh Programmers Workshop (MPW) or ToolServer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To run SSADMIN on the Macintosh:
	
	1. Start MPW or ToolServer. (See your documentation on these tools for
	  information on how to set them up.)
	
	2. Set the Directory to the SourceSafe Mac folder where the Macintosh version of
	  SSADMIN is located.
	
	  For example, on MPW, set the directory to "HD:srcsafe:mac:" where 'HD' is the
	  drive, 'srcsafe' is the SourceSafe folder, and 'mac' is the Macintosh
	  subfolder.
	
	3. Run SSADMIN.
	
	4. You are presented with a menu of options.
