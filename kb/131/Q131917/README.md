	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, and you have a
	large mail message file (MMF), the program may terminate with a message
	indicating that there is not enough free hard drive space available.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	The following alternatives may be used:
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	- Export mail from the MMF to an export file. (This will move mail out of the
	  MMF and into an export file that may reside on another drive.)
	
	- Rename the old MMF, then create a new one.
	
	- Import mail back into the new MMF.
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	  Compress the MMF (Hold the F5 key down when you launch Mail). This may reduce
	  the MMF to a more manageable size.
	
	Method 3
	--------
	
	  Delete unnecessary mail to reduce the size of the MMF file.
