	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print to a laser printer from one of the applications listed at the top
	of this article, solid black lines print on the right side of pages.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if you are using an Apple LaserWriter printer driver version
	earlier than 8.2.2.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Install and use the Apple LaserWriter printer driver version 8.2.2. The driver
	is included with the applications listed at the top of this article.
	
	To install the Apple LaserWriter printer driver, do the following:
	
	1. Double-click the CD-ROM for the application listed at the top of this
	  article.
	
	2. Open the Installer Files folder.
	
	3. Copy the LaserWriter 8.2.2. folder to your hard disk drive.
	
	4. Open your hard disk drive. Open the LaserWriter 8.2.2. folder.
	
	5. Drag the following items to your Extensions folder:
	   - LaserWriter 8
	   - Printer Descriptions
	
	6. From the Apple menu, choose Chooser.
	
	7. In the upper-left corner of Chooser, select the LaserWriter 8 icon. In the
	  upper-right corner of Chooser, select your printer.
	
	8. Press Setup.
	
	9. Close Chooser, and print your document from the application listed at the top
	  of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following information comes from Section 8 of the Encarta 1995 ReadMe file.
	For more information about printing issues, see your Encarta ReadMe file.
	
	8. PRINTING FROM ENCARTA
	------------------------
	
	Encarta '95 does not offer an Advanced Printer Driver Options dialog. If you have
	a printer that requires this dialog to change settings (e.g. to change color or
	resolution settings), you must run another application such as SimpleText, and
	use that application's Page Setup dialog to access the Advanced Printer Driver
	Options dialog.
	
	Encarta '95 does not always print properly with LaserWriter version 7.x drivers.
	Problems you may see when printing with these driver versions include:
	
	a. Media items print in black and white instead of grayscale despite proper
	  printer settings.
	
	b. Sections of text overlap other sections of text, and images within the
	  article text have black bars printed on the right side.
	
	To solve these problems, we have provided a LaserWriter version 8.2.2 driver on
	the Encarta '95 CD. To install this driver on your system, you must open your
	System Folder and open your Extensions folder. Open the Installer Files folder
	on the Encarta '95 CD-ROM and open the LaserWriter 8.2.2 folder. Drag the
	"LaserWriter 8" file into your Extensions folder. Then drag the "Printer
	Descriptions" folder into your extensions folder. If this folder already exists
	on your hard drive, drag the contents of the Printer Descriptions folder from
	the CD into the Printer Descriptions folder on your hard drive. Once you have
	copied these files, select Chooser from the Apple menu. Locate and select the
	LaserWriter 8 item in the upper left box within the Chooser. You may need to
	scroll down to find this item. Select your printer in the printer list box.
	Select Setup.
