	When you choose Go To on the Edit menu or press CTRL+Q to bring up the Go
	To dialog box, the week entry allows weeks 0 through 99 as valid week
	numbers.
	
	Week 0 is equal to week 52 of the previous year and is provided so that
	users can easily return to the previous year. Typing or selecting a week
	number greater than 52 will take you to the appropriate week in the
	following year. For example, selecting week 75 will display week 23 of the
	following year (75-52=23).
