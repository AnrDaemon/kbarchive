	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are working with an image in Windows 95 Paint, the following problems
	may occur when you invoke Help:
	
	- When you are editing text with the Text tool, the text disappears when you
	  start Help and does not reappear when you close Help.
	
	- If part of the image is selected with the Select or Free Form Select tool, it
	  is no longer selected after you start Help.
	
	- If you are editing an image with the Curve or Polygon tool, it disappears
	  after you start Help.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:
	
	- Save the file before you start Help so that you can reopen the intact file
	  after you close Help.
	
	- Click elsewhere in the Paint workspace to set the image, or click another
	  control on the toolbar, before you start Help.
	
	Note that these workarounds work for disappearing text or images. There is no
	workaround to keep part of the image selected with the Select or Free Form
	Select tool when you start Help. You must select the area again after you close
	Help.
