## Q131809: The Microsoft Network Puts Files in Cache Folder

	Article: Q131809

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The files in the Program Files\The Microsoft Network\Cache folder contain icons
	and banners from The Microsoft Network. When you first go to an area of The
	Microsoft Network, that information is downloaded to the Cache folder so the
	service will be faster the next time you go to that area.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In general, deleting the cache files should not cause a problem, but delete them
	at your own risk. The Microsoft Network does not take responsibility for files
	that are deleted from this folder. Access to The Microsoft Network will be
	slower the first time you view an icon or banner because it must again be
	downloaded to your computer.
	
	CAUTION: Make sure you are signed off The Microsoft Network before you delete any
	files from the Cache folder.
