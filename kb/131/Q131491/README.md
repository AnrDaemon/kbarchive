	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You can simultaneously press ALT and one of the arrow keys to navigate between
	dates in the Daily, Monthly, and Planner views. This functionality currently
	does not work with the Weekly and Yearly views, as follows:
	
	- ALT+arrow does not work at all in the Weekly view.
	
	- ALT+arrow initially works after you add the Yearly tab; however, if you then
	  change to another view and then return to the Yearly view, ALT+arrow no
	  longer functions.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
