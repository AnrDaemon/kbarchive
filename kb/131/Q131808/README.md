	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are participating in a chat session, you may experience the following
	problems:
	
	- Messages stop appearing.
	
	- Any messages you send disappear.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	There are two possible causes:
	
	- The chat server has stopped responding (hung). No error message is generated
	  when this occurs.
	
	- The chat server has been taken offline for maintenance. You do not receive a
	  notification.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Exit and re-enter the chat session. This starts the chat session on another
	server. If re-entering the chat session does not work, the chat servers are
	offline for maintenance.
