	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to print more than 99 copies of the current Wine Selector wine list
	to a LaserJet printer, only one copy prints.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To print more than 99 copies of the selected list of wines, you need to print
	the copies in two or more batches.
	
	For example, if you want to print 100 copies, you can print two batches
	containing 50 copies each.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	PCL (Printer Control Language) is used in the LaserJet printer technology. PCL
	is designed to print 1 to 99 copies even though higher numbers can be entered in
	the Copies box. Other printer technologies are not affected by this problem
	(i.e. inkjet).
