	computer restarts.

	================
	
	This is the same behavior that occurs when you are using CD Player to play an
	audio CD and the Stop CD Playing On Exit option is disabled. If you want audio
	CDs to stop playing when you restart Windows 95, use CD Player and enable the
	Stop CD Playing On Exit option. To do so, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
	  Multimedia, then click CD Player.
