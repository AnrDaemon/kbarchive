	In versions 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the INSERT key on

	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a
	of Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
