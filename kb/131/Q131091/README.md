	Item ID   Filename       Description
	-------   --------       -----------
	
	S15307    MFCMSG.EXE     The MFCMSG.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        article named "Meandering Through the Maze of MFC
	                        Message and Command Routing," by Paul Dilascia.
	
	                        MFC's message routing paths are labyrinthine, to
	                        say the least. Paul DiLascia describes the big
	                        picture of command routing, examines how MFC
	                        implements specific behavior for various classes,
	                        and details ways to override MFC's default routing
	                        behavior.
	
	S15308    GDIOBJ.EXE     The GDIOBJ.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        article named "Programming Windows 95 with MFC,
	                        Part II: Working with DCs, Pens, and Brushes,"
	                        by Jeff Prosise.
	
	                        Jeff Prosise first discusses the CDC class and its
	                        derivatives, used for text and graphics output. He
	                        demonstrates how to use pens and brushes in a
	                        sample application, and then adds a scroll bar to
	                        the application to illustrate MFC scrolling logic.
