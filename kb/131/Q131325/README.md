	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select the "Browse folders by using a single window that changes as you
	open each folder" view option, the sort order may not be saved after you change
	it.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs if you change the sort order and then select a different
	window. The sort order is not saved, even if you return to the original window.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Open My Computer and change the sort order by clicking the View menu, pointing
	to Arrange Icons, and clicking the sort order you want. Close My Computer
	without performing any other action. When you re-open My Computer, the new
	setting will be in use.
