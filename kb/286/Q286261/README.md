## Q286261: Duplicate Messages Received by a Public Folder

	Article: Q286261
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 5.5
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbExchange550preSP5fix
	Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If mail is sent to a distribution list, and some of the members of that
	distribution list have a public folder as an alternate recipient, the public
	folder receives duplicate mails for each member of the distribution list who has
	a public folder as an alternate recipient, instead of receiving only one mail.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem can occur if the information store incorrectly allocates a new
	Internet message ID for messages that are sent to public folders. In the
	scenario in the "Symptoms" section of this article, the information store treats
	the messages that are sent to the distribution list and the public folder as
	separate; therefore, multiple messages are seen in the public folders, instead
	of one.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
	phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

	NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
	be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
	update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.

	later:

	| File name | Version     |
