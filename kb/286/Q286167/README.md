	When you start one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article you
	may experience one or more of the following symptoms:
	
	- The computer stops responding (hangs).
	
	- Graphics in the game appear distorted or fuzzy.
	
	- The screen turns black.
	
	- Horizontal lines appear across the screen.
	
	- The game quits unexpectedly immediately after you start it.
	
	- An error message about DirectX or DirectDraw appears.

	fully support DirectX. Some cards provide limited support for DirectX 5.0 and
	earlier. For more information, contact Evans & Sutherland support.

	You may be able to resolve this issue by downloading and installing the latest
