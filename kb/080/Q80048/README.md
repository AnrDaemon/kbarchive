	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you run Microsoft Windows Paintbrush with a monochrome display, such as VGA
	Mono, EGA Mono, CGA, Paintbrush displays and prints using the black- and-white
	palette only.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows Paintbrush displays and prints according to the type of hardware
	selected during Windows setup.
	
	If you select a color display setting, Paintbrush displays in color and is
	capable of printing in color if your configuration supports color printing (that
	is, you have a color printer with the appropriate color printer driver installed
	and the bitmap being printed is in color).
	
	If you select a monochrome display, then Paintbrush displays a color bitmap using
	a black-and-white palette, and is capable of printing in the black- and-white
	palette only, regardless of the printer driver is installed.
