	- Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Sound Blaster Pro includes a mixer-control program for Windows with Multimedia
	Extensions version 1.0. The mixer-control application (SBMIXER.EXE) may cause
	your machine to experience erratic behavior or lock up (hang) when running
	Windows.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Creative Labs, the creator of Sound Blaster Pro, is aware of this problem and
	has provided an updated version of the mixer to solve this problem. The updated
	version puts the mixer into the Windows Control Panel.
	
	If the file size of SBMIXER.EXE is 25792 and/or the SNDBLST.DLL file size is
	23776, then an upgrade is necessary.
	
	To obtain this upgrade, contact Creative Labs Technical Support or connect to the
	Creative Labs bulletin board service (BBS).
	
	The Creative Labs product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent
	of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
	product's performance or reliability.
