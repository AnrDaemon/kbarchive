	Currently, there is no specific printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP)
	Rugged Writer printer. According to Hewlett-Packard technical support, the Epson
	LQ-1000 or LQ-1500 printer driver should be chosen when printing from Windows.
	
	According to Hewlett-Packard technical support, the printer should be placed in
	alternate mode by placing Dip Switch B-1 in the "up" position, which selects
	Epson emulation.
