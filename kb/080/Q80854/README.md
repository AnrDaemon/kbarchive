	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Write accessory application included with Microsoft Windows does not
	make backups of files when they are first created. This happens even if you
	select the Make Backup option in the Save dialog box. A backup is not
	made on the initial save of a file. Instead, the backup is made the
	next time the file is modified.
	
	The original file, without modifications, is saved as the backup file
	with a .BKP extension. The modified file is saved as the working file
	with a .WRI extension.
