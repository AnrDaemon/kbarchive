	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Schedule+ for the Apple Macintosh, if the "Distribute my
	appointment boxes to other servers" setting in a user's Preferences dialog box
	is turned off, the schedule information that has already been distributed to
	other servers will not be deleted immediately. However, no new information will
	be distributed.
	
	The information that exists on other servers will be retained until it has aged
	beyond the "Delete Schedule+ information more than X months old" setting in the
	Administration Settings dialog box. Administration Settings can only be accessed
	by the Network Manager.
