	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When taking off in Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh version 4.0,
	winds do not affect ground takeoff. Acceleration on the ground will be the same
	as without any winds, but once the plane has cleared the ground, winds will
	affect the aircraft.
	
	Steps to Reproduce Problem
	--------------------------
	
	1. Start Flight Simulator and choose Airports from the World Menu. Select
	  Central and Northern Illinois from the Area list, and Select Chicago-Merrill
	  C. Meigs Field-Runway 18 as the airport and click OK.
	
	2. Choose Winds from the World menu and set Surface Winds to a Depth of 2000
	  feet, speed to 100 knots, and Direction at 180 degrees.
	
	3. Take off from Meigs Field. Notice that acceleration is normal even though
	  there is a 100 knot headwind. Also notice that as soon as the aircraft leaves
	  the ground, it starts flying backwards.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
