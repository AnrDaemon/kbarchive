	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Printing graphics from Windows using a Nicolet Zeta-8 Plotter may produce
	garbled or incomplete output.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This plotter is designed to emulate the Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language
	(HPGL), and should use the Windows HPGL drivers 7475A, 7485A, and 7485B,
	depending on the plotter model.
	
	To determine whether proper emulation is possible, contact Data Graphics for
	additional technical support assistance.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	HPGL is a language designed for storing graphical images. Originally developed
	for plotter images, HPGL translates graphics into a metafile format (files of
	instructions that a program can use to re-create the original image). HPGL
	graphics can be used by applications that can interpret the HPGL format.
	
	Customers with plotters manufactured prior to 1985 can upgrade to emulate HPGL by
	obtaining firmware from Data Graphics. To determine if this upgrade is
	necessary, contact Nicolet Technical Support.
	
	For additional information, a firmware upgrade, or to determine a proper
	emulation, please contact Data Graphics Technical Support.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
	we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
	or reliability.
