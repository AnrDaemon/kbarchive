	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Soft Logic Solutions produces a disk defragmentation program. This program
	(OPTIMIZE.EXE) must be version 4.05 or later to properly function with MS-DOS
	versions 5.0 and later.
	
	When OPTIMIZE.EXE is invoked on an MS-DOS 5.0 or later system, the program
	appears to be working but then stops (hangs) shortly afterwards. This occurs on
	either a hard disk or a floppy disk.
