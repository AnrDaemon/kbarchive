	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The left bookend on Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows version 1.0's main Books
	screen is cropped by design. This is so the product can occupy the upper portion
	of the screen while still allowing Windows to display icons on the bottom of the
	screen. It also allows for extensibility (that is, so more books can be added to
	the bookshelf).
