	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	AutoCAD release 10 for MS-DOS cannot access extended memory provided by the
	HIMEM /int15=xxxx switch. A patch file that allows AutoCAD 10 to allocate XMS
	extended memory is available from Autodesk. HIMEM.SYS provides XMS extended
	memory by default. AutoCAD386 is not affected by this problem.
