	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	PROGSET is a Windows utility program that allows you to view, add, modify, or
	delete file associations and remove installed programs in the WIN.INI file.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Many programs modify WIN.INI when they are added to Windows. If you decide to
	delete one or more of these programs, the entries about that program are still
	in the WIN.INI file. PROGSET allows you to remove each program's entries without
	the possibility of corrupting the WIN.INI file. PROGSET also allows you to view,
	add, or delete file associations in WIN.INI. PROGSET asks for a confirmation
	before making any changes.
	
	PROGSET can be set up as an icon or run from the Program Manager.
	
	The PROGSET utility is available from "PC Magazine." The product included here is
	manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied
	or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
