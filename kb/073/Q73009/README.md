	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Limited testing of the Panasonic KX-P1124 printer has shown that poor print
	quality is produced when the IBM Proprinter X24 emulation is used.
	
	The IBM Proprinter X24 emulation, Graphic Set 1 or Graphic Set 2 produces fonts
	that appear to have been compressed vertically. These compressed fonts may
	appear to be random, although they occur on individual lines.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	For better results, use the Epson LQ-2500/2550 driver emulation.
