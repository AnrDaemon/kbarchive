	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains information about printing with the Cardfile program
	packaged with Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and later.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Windows Cardfile application has two options for printing: Print and Print
	All. If the Print option is selected, only the active card (at the front of the
	stack) prints. The Print All option causes all cards in the active file to
	print.
	
	The default margins allow four cards to print on 8.5 x 11 inch paper. A maximum
	of five cards can print on an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper. To do this, set the
	top and bottom margins to .75 (three-quarter inch) by using the Page Setup
	command under the File menu. This allows the header and footer to print without
	overlaying any cards. The header and footer are optional and may be deleted
	using the same Page Setup option as before.
	
	Cardfile only prints cards in a single column running down the page.
	
	Workaround
	----------
	
	1. Change the filename so that it has a .TXT extension.
	
	2. Open the .TXT file in Microsoft Word for MS-DOS.
	
	3. Make the desired formatting changes.
	
	4. Save the file in Word format with a .DOC extension.
	
	NOTE: After performing steps 1-4, this file can be opened in Word for Windows,
	too.
