	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	After editing the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, WIN.INI, or the SYSTEM.INI
	files, SysEdit creates a backup of the original file and places an .SYD
	extension on the file. For example, if a change was made to WIN.INI,
	SysEdit saves the original file as WIN.SYD and the new file is saved as
	WIN.INI. This also is true with the other files that are edited with
	SysEdit.
