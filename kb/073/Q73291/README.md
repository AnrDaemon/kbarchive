	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Gibson Research produces a low-level formatting utility called Spinrite II.
	Spinrite II versions 1.1 and 2.0 are compatible with MS-DOS 5.x, 6.0, 6.2, and
	6.21 in most cases.
	
	According to Gibson Research, Spinrite II version 2.0 is essentially the same as
	version 1.1, but it contains fixes for a few obscure hard drive controllers.
	Version 2.0 was released in March of 1991, and can be identified by a serial
	number on the opening screen starting with the letter D or a subsequent letter
	(that is, D-Z).
	
	Spinrite II version 1.0 is not compatible with MS-DOS 5.0 and later. This version
	can be identified by serial numbers beginning with the letter B or C.
