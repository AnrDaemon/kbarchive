	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	QDOS II, a disk manager from Gazelle Systems, is incompatible with MS-DOS
	version 5.0. Gazelle advises QDOS II customers to upgrade to QDOS III, which
	Gazelle says is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0 and 6.0. Gazelle Systems has
	confirmed that all versions of QDOS III (1.0, 1.3 and 1.4), are compatible with
	MS-DOS 6.x and DoubleSpace/DriveSpace.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	QDOS II is available in two releases. Release 1 is MS-DOS version 3.3 compatible
	only and halts (hangs) the system immediately when loaded in MS-DOS versions 4.x
	or later.
	
	Release 2 has a file date of 9-15-88 and appears to function correctly under all
	versions, but does not accurately display a directory if the directory file has
	been fragmented in MS-DOS versions 4.x or later. This problem usually manifests
	itself as "garbage" files in the directory or as a "too many directories" error
	message.
	
	According to Gazelle Systems, QDOS III functions properly under all MS-DOS
	versions. Gazelle Systems will upgrade QDOS II customers to QDOS III for $30. To
	obtain the upgrade, contact Gazelle Systems.
	
	The Gazelle Systems product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent
	of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
	product's performance or reliability.
