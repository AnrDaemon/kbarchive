	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following is a list of documentation additions and corrections for Chapters
	11 through 20 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" for version
	6.0. The section and page numbers are listed first, followed by a description of
	the addition or correction.
	
	Section 11.6.2, Pages 328-329
	-----------------------------
	
	Anchor blocks are not supported in RTF format, so there is no documented method
	for creating hyperlinks that have more than one word in RTF format. By default,
	any text between an RTF code and hidden text on a single line becomes a
	hyperlink. For more information, query on the following words:
	
	  " HELPMAKE and RTF and anchor " (without the quotation marks)
	
	Section 16.3.5, Page 444
	------------------------
	
	The following information comes from the README.DOC file included in the MASM 6.0
	package:
	
	  Add these paragraphs to Section 16.3.5, "Bit Fields."
	
	  H2INC translates anonymous bitfields by padding with a tag corresponding to
	  the bit position.
	
	  For example,
	
	        struct s
	        {
	           int :8;
	           int j:8;
	        }
	
	  becomes:
	
	     s      RECORD  j@s:8,
	                    @8@s:8
	
	Section 17.5, Page 460
	----------------------
	
	The second-to-last paragraph gives instructions for binding under PWB. Where it
	says "Select Bound Application from the LINK Options command in the Options
	menu," it should say "Select Bind Executable File from the LINK Options command
	in the Options menu."
	
	Section 18.3.2, Page 470
	------------------------
	
	The function prototypes for GetGCount and GetPCount are missing the FAR keyword.
	The corrected prototypes should read as follows:
	
	     GetGCount PROTO FAR PASCAL
	     GetPCount PROTO FAR PASCAL
	
	Section 18.3.2, Page 471
	------------------------
	
	The call to the function VioWrtTTY should read:
	
	     INVOKE  VioWrtTTY,     instead of    INVOKE VioWrtTTy,
	             es::di,                             es:di,
	             si,                                 si,
	             hv                                  hv
	
	Section 20.3, Page 521
	----------------------
	
	In the first paragraph, the "EXTERN A__ACRTUSED" reference should be a changed to
	"EXTERN __ACRTUSED".
	
	Section 20.3.1, Page 526
	------------------------
	
	The first line of code generated by H2INC should read:
	
	     @proto_0 TYPEDEF  PROTO C :PTR SBYTE, :BYTE
	
	instead of
	
	     TYPEDEF  PROTO C :PTR SBYTE, :BYTE
	
	Section 20.3.2, Page 529
	------------------------
	
	In the chart of equivalent data types, the last entry should read:
	
	  FORTRAN Type                    Equivalent MASM Type
	  ------------                    --------------------
	  REAL*8, DOUBLE PRECISION        REAL8
	
	instead of
	
	  REAL*8, DOUBLE PRECISION        REAL4
	
	Section 20.3.3, Page 533
	------------------------
	
	The following information comes from the README.DOC file included in the MASM 6.0
	package:
	
	  Add these paragraphs to Section 20.3.3, "The Basic/MASM Interface."
	
	  When interfacing with Basic, all EXTERNs that are far must be declared outside
	  of a code or data segment.
	
	  This is incorrect:
	
	  .MODEL medium .CODE EXTERN StringAddress:FAR
	
	  This is correct:
	
	  .MODEL medium EXTERN StringAddress:FAR .CODE
	
	Additional query words: 6.00 6.00a 6.00b
