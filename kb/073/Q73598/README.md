	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) Vectra CS/20 portable requires a 1.44 MB floppy disk to
	be in drive A at startup time for the MS-DOS FORMAT, DISKCOPY, and DISKCOMP
	commands to recognize the drive as a 1.44 MB floppy drive. If you do not place a
	1.44 MB floppy disk in drive A, the FORMAT, DISKCOPY, and DISKCOMP commands
	treat drive A as a 720K floppy drive. HP's version of MS-DOS version 5.0
	corrects this problem.
	
	The product included here, the HP Vectra CS/20, is manufactured by vendors
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
	this product's performance or reliability.
