	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade package is shipped with a backup\restore
	combination called HDBKUP\HDRSTORE. The Setup program in the Microsoft MS- DOS 5
	Upgrade package gives you the option of backing up your hard disk before
	proceeding with the installation. The backup program used in this instance is
	HDBKUP.
	
	The HDBKUP program can also be started from the command prompt by doing the
	following:
	
	1. Insert Disk 1 from the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade disks into a floppy disk
	  drive (for example, drive A).
	
	2. Switch to that drive (for example, type "a:" (without the quotation marks).
	
	3. Type "HDBKUP" (without the quotation marks) and follow the instructions on
	  the screen.
