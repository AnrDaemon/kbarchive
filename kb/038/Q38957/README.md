	If you already have 5.25-inch disks for a given version of QuickBASIC
	but wish to obtain the 3.5-inch disks for that version, you need to
	contact the Microsoft Information Service at (800) 426-9400 or
	Microsoft Customer Service at (206) 882-8088 between 6 AM and 5:30 PM
	Pacific time.
	
	The 3.5-inch disks were produced for the following QuickBASIC
	versions:
	
	   2.01
	   3.00
	   4.00
	   4.00b
	   4.50
	
	When you contact Microsoft Customer Service or the Microsoft
	Information Center, you need one of the following:
	
	   Registration Card (if you haven't sent it in)
	   Product Number on the disk
	   Document Number inside the QuickBASIC manuals
	
	If you already have 5.25-inch disks for a given version of QuickBASIC
	from Version 2.01 through Version 4.50, Microsoft can send you the
	3.5-inch disks if available for that same version number. As of
	December 1988, there is no charge for this, but you must confirm the
	charges and conditions with Microsoft Customer Service.
