	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The south-end altitude of Boeing Field is 400 feet and the north-end altitude is
	17 feet above sea level. As you taxi from the south end to the north end of the
	runway, the elevation decreases approximately 383 feet. Because of this change,
	you will experience a crash in Versions 2.13 and 2.14. In Versions 3.00 and
	Version 4.00, the plane does not crash, but the altitude changes drastically on
	the altimeter.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
