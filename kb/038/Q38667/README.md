	2. Start the Notifier and sign in to Microsoft Mail.
	
	3. Start Windows.

	  system.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	As you work with applications in Windows, you can check your mailbox by
	switching from the application's window to the MS-DOS Executive window and
	running MAIL286.PIF.
	
	While working with an application in Windows/286, the Notifier alert window won't
	appear when you receive a new message if the application is displaying in
	graphics mode. However, you will hear a chime if you've chosen that option from
	the Preferences dialog box (on the Mail menu).
	
	For more information about running Mail with Windows/286, see Appendix C, "Using
	Mail with Microsoft Windows," in the "Microsoft Mail User's Guide."
