	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Windows supports Hewlett-Packard (HP) Font Cartridges "A" through "Z,"
	except for I,O,W,X cartridges. For use with Windows, these font cartridges must
	be installed using the Windows Control Panel. The following is the installation
	procedure:
	
	1. Choose Printer from the Setup menu of the Control Panel.
	
	2. Select "PCL / HP LaserJet on . . . ."
	
	3. Choose the OK button.
	
	The Windows driver supports one font cartridge for the LaserJet, LaserJet Plus,
	and LaserJet 500+. Up to two cartridges are supported for the LaserJet Series
	II, and three are supported for the LaserJet
	
	1. Custom-made font cartridges produced by Hewlett-Packard are not
	
	supported under Windows as there are no Windows drivers available for these
	cartridges.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A font cartridge consists of a portable plug-in unit, which is about the size of
	an old eight-track tape cartridge, containing electronic circuitry and two to
	four memory chips. The memory chips house all the data needed to re-create
	entire sets of characters on a LaserJet Printer. Font cartridges are often
	referred to as "hard" fonts, because the data necessary to print with the font
	is stored inside the physical cartridge, or "hardware."
	
	Hewlett-Packard offers a wide range of font cartridges, each one containing a
	related group of fonts. There are general purpose cartridges designed to be used
	with general text and data processing, and specialized cartridges to fit the
	needs of legal, accounting, and other professions.
