## Q38654: Problem with Mouse and PS/2 Model 70A21

{% raw %}

	Article: Q38654
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 1.00
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 18-APR-1990
	
	Older models of the PS/2 Model 70A21 will not boot with the mouse in
	the mouse port.
	
	The machine hangs and gives an 8603 error, indicating something is
	wrong with the mouse. The mouse functions properly in the serial
	ports, and an IBM mouse will work in the mouse port with the drivers
	provided by Microosft.
	
	There is a patch that will correct this problem. Contact Microsoft
	Product Support Services at (206) 454-2030 for this patch.
