	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you minimize the Microsoft Train Simulator window to the taskbar, and then
	double-click the Train Simulator icon to maximize it, the program unexpectedly
	opens in Window mode, and you cannot move the mouse pointer over it as expected.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To restore Train Simulator to Full Screen mode, move your mouse pointer behind
	the current Train Simulator window, and then click once.
	
	NOTE: When you move the pointer into the space of the Train Simulator window
	(when it is in Window mode), the pointer disappears "under" the window. At this
	point, click once to expand the window to Full Screen mode. You can now position
	your pointer over the window as expected.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================

	once. Do not double-click it.
