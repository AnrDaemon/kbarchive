	This behavior can occur if DirectX has become corrupted.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	There are two possible resolutions to this issue. The first is to install

	Use the following steps:
	
	1. Insert the installation CD into the CD-ROM drive. Press and hold the SHIFT
	  key to prevent the program from starting.
	
	2. Double-click My Computer.
	
	3. Right-click the letter of the drive that has the installation CD, and then
	  click Install DirectX 8.0a.
	
	4. Follow the prompts.
	
	If installing DirectX 8.0a does not help, work around this issue by pressing
	ALT+TAB to minimize the screen, and then pressing ALT+TAB again to maximize the
	screen.
	
	The second resolution is to download and install the latest version of DirectX
