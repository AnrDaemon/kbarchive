	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To prevent words from being incorrectly identified as "misspelled" by the
	spelling checker in MSN Explorer, you can add words to the spelling checker
	dictionary. Examples of these types of words include the following:
	
	- Your last name
	
	- A name of a company you frequently write about in e-mail
	
	- Any word that the dictionary in your spelling checker wouldn't normally
	  recognize
	
	But though you may wish to remove or modify words in the dictionary of your
	spelling checker, you may not know how to do so.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You cannot edit the spelling checker dictionary through MSN Explorer; you must
	add words by editing the msnspell.dic file on your computer. In addition, the
	words you add to the MSN Explorer dictionary through the msnspell.dic file are
	not shared across other programs on your computer (Microsoft Office, Microsoft
	Works). So, for example, when you add words to the dictionary in Microsoft Word,
	the words will not be automatically added to your MSN Explorer dictionary.
	Finally, because MSN Explorer creates a custom dictionary specifically for your
	user account, words added to your custom dictionary are not added to the
	dictionaries of others who may have user tiles on the same computer.
	
	The msnspell.dic file is a text file, so you can open and modify this file using
	Notepad or other text editors.
	
	To find msnspell.dic, you must first configure your computer to display hidden
	files.

	3. In the Look in box, make sure that your hard drive (usually C:) is selected,
	  and then select the Include subfolders box.

	  the most recently modified file.
	
	5. In the top menu, click File, and then click Open Containing Folder.
	
	6. Double click msnspell.dic.
