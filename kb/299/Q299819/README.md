	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you press SHIFT+G to operate a switch in Microsoft Train Simulator, the
	switch may not move as expected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the train is positioned either on top of or too close
	to the switch for the switch to be moved.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, back the train up to clear the switch, and then try
	moving the switch again.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	A switching operation can be performed either in front of or behind the train.
	However, switching cannot be performed if the train is too close to, or directly
	on top of, the switch itself.
