	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses known issues with the Activities offered in Microsoft
	Train Simulator. These issues are detailed in the "More Information" section of
	this article.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Timer Is Not Updated for Loading Saved Activities
	-------------------------------------------------
	
	- If you save an Activity when the load or unload passengers timer is running,
	  that timer is not updated in the driving aid the next time that you load the
	  saved Activity. (However, you do still receive the signal to depart at the
	  expected time.)
	
	When Attempting to Explore-Route
	--------------------------------
	
	- Attempting to drive an Acela HHP-8 train on Tokyo-Hakone line starting in
	  Hakone-Yumoto and heading towards Shinjuku. The train will reach an impass
	  late in the first major (left) curve. You may also note the overhead
	  powerlines are not physically supported by pylons or towers.
	
	Royal Scot Rescue Activity
	--------------------------
	
	- In the "Royal Scot Rescue" Activity, it is crucial that the train is backed
	  into Ribblehead siding 1 to register and enable the Activity to end. Back the
	  train up as far as possible (to the buffer on this siding) to trigger the end
	  of the Activity when you arrive with the Royal Scot's Consist in Dent.
	
	Loading Activity During Derailment
	----------------------------------
	
	- If you attempt to load a saved Activity during a derailment, Train Simulator
	  may stop responding or quit (crash).
	
	Murder on the Orient Express
	----------------------------
	
	- To pick up the detective's assistant, the Goelsdorf 380 locomotive, not the
	  Consist, must be near the center of platform 3 in Zirl.
	
	Northeast Corridor Summer Express
	---------------------------------
	
	- The Edgewood station stop is very short. Using the Next Station display as a
	  guide, come to a complete stop at exactly -0.01 miles to load and unload
	  passengers.
	
	- Be aware that there is a delay in waiting for the red light to change to
	  green near milepost 43.5.
	
	- Waiting points are all being reset to zero seconds.
	
	Northeast Corridor Short Passenger Run
	--------------------------------------
	
	- When you start the Short Passenger Run on the Northeast Corridor, your train
	  unexpectedly derails 2 minutes to 3 minutes into the activity. To workaround
	  this issue, immediately after the activity begins increase to full throttle
	  and hold your speed.
	
	Tokyo-Hakone Route
	------------------
	
	- There are several stations in which the signals are placed so close to the
	  platform that the train does not pass the signal completely when it stops.
	  Rolling backwards at one of these stations causes the Activity to end with an
	  "ignored red light" message. To resolve this issue, try to stop at the
	  platforms in such a way that the end of the train passes the signal
	  completely. (One example of this type of station is Umegaoka Station.)
	
	Whitefish Switching Yard
	------------------------
	
	- The switch for the "West Rip" does not function as expected. To complete the
	  activity, you must loop around the yard and open the switch from the other
	  side.
