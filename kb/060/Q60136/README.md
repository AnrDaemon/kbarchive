## Q60136: Near Strings Hotkey in Make EXE Dialog Box Does Not Toggle

	Article: Q60136
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 7.00
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | SR# S900319-29 buglist7.00 fixlist7.10 | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 20-SEP-1990
	
	In the QBX.EXE editor, the Near Strings hotkey (ALT+N) in the Make EXE
	File dialog box does not move the option marker to the Near Strings
	option -- only the cursor is moved to the option. The arrow keys must
	be used to change this option.
	
	All other hotkeys -- ALT+F for Far Strings, ALT+A for Alternate Math
	and so on -- move the option marker to the desired option. Only the
	Near Strings hotkey (ALT+N) does not.
	
	To work around this problem, use the arrow keys to move to the Near
	Strings option. (The arrows can be used for any of the choices.)
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the QBX.EXE
	environment that comes with Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
	System (PDS) version 7.00. This problem was corrected in QBX.EXE in
	BASIC PDS 7.10.
