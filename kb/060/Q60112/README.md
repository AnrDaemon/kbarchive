	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If the Microsoft Mail custom form for the AppleLink gateway is deleted, you
	can't install just the AppleLink custom form. To regain access to the AppleLink
	custom form, you must use the Gateway Installer to reinstall the entire
	AppleLink gateway.
	
	To make this procedure easier, take advantage of the Copy Accounts And Recipients
	command on the Gateway menu (in the Gateway Installer) to save account and
	recipient information in a file. When the gateway installation is complete, use
	the Install Accounts And Recipients command on the Gateway menu to install the
	saved account and recipient information.
	
	Please note that the custom form for the AppleLink gateway isn't part of Mail and
	it comes as part of the AppleLink gateway. Also note that you don't have to use
	the AppleLink custom form to send Mail through the AppleLink gateway. The Note
	form and most other forms with a text-based body can be used as well. The
	AppleLink custom form is special in that it is 80 characters wide.
