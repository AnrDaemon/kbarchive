	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Spin lesson (under Option
	W, See More Lessons) in Flight Instruction mode, you have no idea what the plane
	is doing as it spins because all the ground references are green. Ideally, the
	scenery should be set to small rectangles for this lesson.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
