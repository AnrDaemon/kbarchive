	Amstrad's 286s and 386s, manufactured in Europe, require a motherboard
	revision of "J" or later to accommodate installation of Windows
	version 3.0. An earlier motherboard results in the machine locking
	during setup, and you must turn your machine off and then back on again
	to regain operation.
