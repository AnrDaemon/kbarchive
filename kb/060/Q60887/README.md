	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Word, you can select only contiguous text and graphics. That is, to
	select a block of text or a combination of text and graphics, the selected items
	must be directly above or below one another.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	By design, you can only copy contiguous items in Microsoft Word for Windows.
	However, Microsoft Word provides a feature that allows you to copy
	non-contiguous information. This feature is called the Spike. To use the Spike,
	follow these steps:
	
	- To cut a selection to the Spike, press CTRL+F3.
	
	  NOTE: This actually creates the AutoText entry called Spike.
	
	- To paste the Spike contents into a document clearing the Spike AutoText
	  entry, press CTRL+SHIFT+F3.
	
	- To paste the Spike contents into a document without clearing the Spike
	  AutoText entry, type the word SPIKE and then press F3.
