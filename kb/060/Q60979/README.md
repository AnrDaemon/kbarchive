	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Flight Simulator manual (Page 139 for version 3.00; Page 132 for version
	4.00), incorrectly states that Flight Simulator supports two or more players in
	multiplayer mode. Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00 support only two
	players in multiplayer mode.
	
	This documentation error has been noted in the README.DOC for Flight Simulator
	version 4.00.
