	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Traffic Pattern lesson
	(under Option W, See More Lessons) in Flight Instruction mode, the instructor
	asks the student to do a landing check. Ideally, the instructor should verify
	that the carburetor heat has been turned on.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
