	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If a Microsoft Mail PC workstation user receives a message sent with a custom
	form and the form is installed in the server, Mail uses the Printed Form (from
	that custom form) to display the information on the screen.
	
	Each custom form has a Printed Form component. The form's creator uses this
	component to specify the buttons and fields that indicate what contents will be
	included on the printed version.
	
	For more information on creating custom forms see, the "Microsoft Mail Network
	Manager's Guide"
