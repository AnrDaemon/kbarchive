	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article discusses the following problems using the Search feature in
	Microsoft Windows File Manager:
	
	- Single Search Window
	
	- Printing a File from the Search Results Window
	
	To Search for a file, choose Search from the File menu.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Single Search Window
	--------------------
	
	You cannot have multiple Search Results windows. All second and subsequent
	queries are placed in the first Search Results window.
	
	If you want to view multiple searches, you can copy the contents displayed in the
	window to the Clipboard by pressing ALT+PRINT SCREEN. This method captures only
	the directories and files that are viewable in the Search Results window. To
	capture a subsequent Search Results window, you must save the Clipboard data to
	a file or paste it into another application such as Paintbrush.
	
	This is by design.
	
	Printing a File from the Search Results Window
	----------------------------------------------
	
	In Microsoft Windows version 3.0 you cannot print a file from the Search Results
	Window. The Print option is unavailable (dimmed) and cannot be selected.
	
	According to pages 124-125 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version
	3.0, you can select files and directories in the Search Results window and use
	File menu commands to print, copy, and move window contents. This is incorrect.
	You can copy and move Search Results window contents, but you cannot print them.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0. This
	problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.
