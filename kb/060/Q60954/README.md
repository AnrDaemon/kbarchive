	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Takeoff Roll lesson in
	the Flight Instruction mode, the instructor does not look to the right for
	incoming traffic before entering the active runway. Ideally, the instructor
	should do a 360 on the taxiway looking for traffic out the front window of the
	plane before entering the runway.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
