	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Every field on a Microsoft Mail form must have a unique name. To name a field,
	select it with the Field tool and then choose Field Info from the Objects menu
	to display the Field Information box.
	
	Fields with the following names function on your form just as they do in
	Microsoft Mail's Note message form. (For example, an Enclosure field on a custom
	form shows the name of an enclosed file.)
	
	Address Label
	  Body
	  Send button
	  Date Stamp (on Read Screen - displays date and time the message is
	              received by recipient's server)
	  Enclosure Label
	  Enclosure (holds enclosed file's name)
	  From (on Read screen)
	  From Label
	  Subject (the contents of this field appear in the recipient's
	           Summary window)
	  User List
	  User List Label
