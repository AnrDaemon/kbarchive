## Q41248: Floppy Setup Only Installs the Libraries

{% raw %}

	Article: Q41248
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 2.00
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | docerr | mspl13_c
	Last Modified: 28-FEB-1989
	
	Page 15 of the "Microsoft QuickC Up and Running" manual incorrectly
	implies the setup program completely installs QuickC. The floppy setup
	is intended to install the C run-time libraries and allow you to
	manually configure QuickC to your system.
	
	There are too many variables involved for one generic setup to install
	QuickC effectively on all possible floppy systems.
