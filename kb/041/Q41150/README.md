## Q41150: SEEK Function Not Hyperlinked to SEEK Statement in QB Help

	Article: Q41150
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | docerr SR# S890115-3 | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 17-FEB-1989
	
	In the QuickBASIC on-line help system, the help screen for the SEEK
	function contains a hyperlink to the SEEK statement, but the SEEK
	statement is missing the hyperlink to the SEEK function.
	
	This information applies only to Microsoft QuickBASIC Version 4.50 for
	MS-DOS.
	
	The only way to bring up the help screen for the SEEK function is to
	select it from the index. If you click the right mouse button on
	either the SEEK statement or the SEEK function, the help screen for
	the SEEK statement comes up, and there is no hyperlink to the SEEK
	function.
