## Q41610: Macros max and min Incorrectly Listed as Functions

	Article: Q41610
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 5.00 5.10 | 5.10
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS | OS/2
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | docerr | mspl13_c
	Last Modified: 16-MAY-1989
	
	Page 181, section 8.3.2 of the "Microsoft C 5.1 Optimizing Compiler
	User's Guide" incorrectly lists max and min as functions that have
	intrinsic forms.
	
	As correctly noted in the "Microsoft C 5.1 Optimizing Compiler
	Run-Time Library Reference" on Pages 413 and 429, max and min are
	macros defined in the include file stdlib.h.
