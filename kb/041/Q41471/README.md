	SHIFT+F1 is the shortcut key for Help on Help. If you have a
	terminate-and-stay resident (TSR) utility such as the Norton Guides
	installed, and you invoke that program with SHIFT+F1, then you can't
	use the SHIFT+F1 shortcut to QuickC's Help on Help. Choose Help on
	Help from the menus instead. Or change the key that triggers the TSR.
