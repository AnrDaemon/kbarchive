	"Pan European" refers to the version of Windows that is distributed in Eastern
	European countries such as Poland, Greece and Turkey. The Pan European version
	of Windows is very similar to the English version, but supports extended
	characters that are used in those regions.
	
	Other European language versions of Windows, such as German, French, Spanish, and
	Italian, are considered "localized" versions.
