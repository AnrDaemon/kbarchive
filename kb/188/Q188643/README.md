## Q188643: XADM: Unable to Hide Global Address List

{% raw %}

	Article: Q188643
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Exchange Server it is possible to create Custom Views for the
	Exchange Server clients to view; however, it is not possible to remove the
	Global Address List entry from view.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you create the Custom Views using Address Book Views and Search
	permissions, the clients will only be able to view the containers that they have
	permissions to view (as described in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article,
	Q182902, "XADM: How To Setup Container Level Search Control"). Although it is
	not possible to hide the words, "Global Address List," it is possible to alter
	or limit what the clients see in the Global Address List when they connect to
	the Exchange Server computer. The Global Address List will contain all
	recipients listed in the containers in which the user has permissions to view.
