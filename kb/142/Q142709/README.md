	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Transferring large files is very slow from a Macintosh computer (on an LocalTalk
	network) to a Windows NT Server version 3.5 computer (on a Token Ring network
	connected to the LocalTalk network by an AppleTalk router) running Services for
	Macintosh (SFM). The same operation works fine between two Macintosh nodes.
	
	This problem only occurs when several AppleTalk routers (Macintosh servers) are
	present on the TokenRing network.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
	version 3.51.
