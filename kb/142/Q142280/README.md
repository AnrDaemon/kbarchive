	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you choose a font from the font list in PowerPoint, only a limited number
	of fonts may be listed, and those listed may have a question mark in front of
	each name instead of a TrueType symbol.
	
	You may also find that regardless of the font or text size you choose, your text
	may appear very small and/or jagged.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This can be caused by any one of the following:
	
	- You do not have a printer driver installed in Windows 95.
	
	- Your current default printer is set to Generic/Text Only.
	
	- The current default printer driver is corrupt or damaged.
	
	- Your current default printer is using a Windows 3.x printer driver.
	
	- Your default printer is a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 and the printer
	  resolution is currently set to 75dpi.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your situation:
	
	- If you have not installed a printer in Windows 95, do so to correct the
	  problem.
	
	- If your default printer is set to Generic/Text only, set another printer as
	  default.
	
	- If your default printer driver is damaged or corrupted, remove that driver
	  and re-install it.
	
	- If your default printer is using a Windows 3.x driver, remove it and install
	  the Windows 95 driver for that printer, or contact the manufacturer of your
	  printer.
	
	- If your default printer is a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500, you can change the
	  printer resolution to 150 dots-per-inch (dpi) or to 300 dpi, or you can set
	  up a new default printer.
