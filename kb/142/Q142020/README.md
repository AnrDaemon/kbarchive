	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Corel Professional Photos CD-ROM compact discs display _1 after all files being
	read from CD-ROM drive (for example, Readme.txt_1, Setup.exe_1, and so on).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a problem with Corel Professional compact discs that were compiled to
	run on multi-platform machines (MAC and Windows NT Server). Windows NT is unable
	to properly translate the 8.3 name standard to longfile format and as a result
	displays a _1 after the extension.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Corel has taken responsibility for this and has compiled a new version for use
	specifically for Windows NT. Contact Corel and request an upgrade.

	Windows NT Server is not supported under the Corel Professional initial release.
