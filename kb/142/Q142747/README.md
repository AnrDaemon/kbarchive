	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to temporarily disable password caching when you are
	using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS). Disabling
	password caching ensures that your password remains secure when other users use
	your computer.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To temporarily disable password caching when you are using MSNDS, use one of the
	following methods:
	
	- To disable password caching when the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is
	  your primary network client, or when the Microsoft Client for NetWare
	  Networks is not your primary network client but the pass- word for your
	  primary network client is null, press and hold down the CTRL key when the
	  Windows 95 logo is displayed. When the first Enter Network Password or
	  Welcome To Windows dialog box is displayed, release the CTRL key.
	
	- To disable password caching when the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is
	  not your primary network client and the password for your primary network
	  client is not null, press and hold down the CTRL key while you click OK in
	  the first Enter Network Password or Welcome To Windows dialog box. When the
	  next Enter Network Password or Welcome to Windows dialog box is displayed,
	  release the CTRL key.
