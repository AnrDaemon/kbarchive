	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft products including Visual C++ support a wide range of national and
	international standards. There is an application called the Microsoft Roadmap to
	Developer Products and Services that is shipped on the Visual C++ 4.0 CD-ROM
	compact disc that enables you to find all the standards that a Microsoft product
	supports. The application also provides a lot of other information about
	Microsoft developer products. To run it, you need to first install it by running
	the Setup.exe program in the Roadmap subdirectory of the CD-ROM compact disc.
	
	If you do not have Visual C++ 4.0 and want to get a copy of the Microsoft Roadmap
	application, you can order it from the Microsoft Developer Solutions Team by
	calling (800) 426-9400.
