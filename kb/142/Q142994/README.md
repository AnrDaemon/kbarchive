	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Overwriting Files
	-----------------
	
	When you download an attachment that overwrites an existing file with the same
	name, you may be asked twice if you want to overwrite the file.
	
	Modifying BBS Messages
	----------------------
	
	When you open a BBS message you can modify it, but you cannot save it back to
	MSN. When you close a modified message, you receive the following message:
	
	  Local message has changed. Do you want to save changes to <message
	  title> before closing?
	
	If you click Yes, you are prompted to save the message to your computer's hard
	disk.
	
	Typing Ahead
	------------
	
	If you open a window to compose a message and type ahead before the window is
	open, the words you type are lost.
	
	Formatting
	----------
	
	If you apply formatting at the end of the subject line, the formatting carries
	over into the message text.
	
	Cannot Drag Attachment to Desktop
	---------------------------------
	
	When you drag an attachment from a BBS message to the desktop, an icon named
	Scrap is created. To download the attachment, double-click it.
	
	No Free Hard Disk Space
	-----------------------
	
	If you attempt to open a BBS message when you have no free hard disk space, you
	receive the following error message:
	
	  Navigator Not Found.
	  A file needed to complete this task is missing or corrupted.
	
	Text Not Correctly Formatted in Notepad
	---------------------------------------
	
	When you save a BBS message as a text-only file and open it using Notepad, the
	text is not correctly formatted. You can work around this problem by using
	WordPad or another word processing program to open the file.
	
	Cannot Print from BBS Window
	----------------------------
	
	Although the Print and Print Setup commands are on the File menu in the BBS
	window, the commands do not work. You can print from an open message.
	
	Reply to Old Message Not Part of Thread
	---------------------------------------
	
	If you reply to an old BBS message, your reply may appear as a new message and
	not part of the original thread.
	
	Incorrectly Displayed Icon
	--------------------------
	
	When you view the properties of a file attached to a BBS message, the icon on the
	Properties tab is not correctly displayed.
	
	Signing Out Causes Messages to Disappear
	----------------------------------------
	
	If you sign out of MSN with a BBS open, when you sign in again, the messages that
	were in the BBS may not appear.
