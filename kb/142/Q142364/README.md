	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to obtain an instrument definition file (IDF) editor
	so you can customize or create an IDF for a MIDI instrument.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	An IDF editor is included with the Microsoft Windows 95 Software Development Kit
	(SDK). For information about obtaining the Windows 95 SDK, please contact the
	Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400
	
	
	Note that this program is provided "as is" and is not supported by Microsoft
	Support Engineers.
	
	IDF files contain information about instrument patch (sound) maps and additional
	instrument-specific information. IDF files are binary files and are not editable
	without the IDF editor.
	
	Windows 95 includes a General.idf file for compatibility with all general MIDI
	instruments. If a MIDI instrument is not general-MIDI-compatible, or has
	capabilities beyond the general MIDI specification, a custom IDF file must be
	created to use the instrument.
