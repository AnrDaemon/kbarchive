	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click an item while either Melanie (in the Projects Room) or McZee (in
	the Ideas Room, Projects Room, and so on) is talking, and/or giving
	instructions, the action associated with that item is not started. The second
	time you click in the same place, the action associated with that item is
	carried out.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	This is by design. Clicking anywhere on the screen should stop Melanie or McZee
	talking, but you should click an item again to activate that item.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The instructions that McZee and Melanie give are presented as videos (.avi
	files) that overlay the background. Clicking the area of the screen where the
	video is playing only stops the delivery of instructions. When instructions are
	being given, there are two applications running: 3D Movie Maker and the
	instructions video. Clicking the video closes that application; you can then
	proceed to click an item you want.
