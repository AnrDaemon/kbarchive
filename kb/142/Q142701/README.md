	The Windows NT Security Account Manager (SAM) does not correctly replicate

	(BDC) from becoming fully synchronized to the Primary Domain Controller (PDC).
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
	problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
