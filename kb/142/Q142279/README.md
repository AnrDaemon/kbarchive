	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print an object with a semi-transparent fill from PowerPoint 95 to a
	Canon BJC-610 printer, the object may appear black on the printout.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is caused by the Canon BJC-610 printer driver. This driver is
	shipped with the printer by Canon and is a Windows 3.1 driver. PowerPoint 95
	uses some features new to Windows 95 to create semi- transparent fills. The
	printer driver does not understand these printing commands and interprets the
	semi-transparent fill as a black fill.
