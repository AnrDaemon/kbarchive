	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Visual FoxPro 3.0b is an international release of Visual FoxPro 3.0. Visual
	FoxPro 3.0b is Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS) enabled, so it can be localized
	into Far Eastern languages. In addition, Visual FoxPro 3.0b ships with SQL
	Server 6.0 ODBC drivers, Windows 95 desktop ODBC drivers, and provides enhanced
	support for OLE Controls. This article provides some general information about
	Visual FoxPro 3.0b.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Q. Why is this version called Visual FoxPro 3.0b? What happened to version
	  3.0a?
	
	A. Version 3.0a is a Double-Byte Character Set (DBCS) enabled release for
	  the Far East only. Visual FoxPro 3.0b is a worldwide release that
	  supports DBCS and is also the version that synchronizes Visual FoxPro
	  with the final releases of Win32s and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).
	
	Q. Do I need to update my Visual FoxPro 3.0 to version 3.0b?
	
	A. The main focus of the update is to enable DBCS support for
	  the Far Eastern languages and to meet the OLE Controls Container
	  specification. Developers who need OLE Control support, improved Win32s
	  support, or the other product enhanccements probably do want to update
	  to Visual FoxPro 3.0b.
	
	Q. I only want the ODBC drivers. What should I do?
	
	A. The current versions of Office 95, Standalone Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
	  Project, and Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 already contain the Windows 95
	  desktop ODBC drivers, so you might already have them. The SQL Server 6.0
	  ODBC driver and the Windows 95 desktop drivers included with 3.0b are
	  also available as an application note on the Web, The Microsoft Network,
	  or the Microsoft FTP site.
	
	For more information about how to obtain these drivers, please see the following
	article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  ARTICLE-ID: Q139487 INF: WX1220: ODBC Drivers Appnote
	
	
	Q. If I do want the actual update, how can I get it?
	
	A. Call Microsoft directly and get it shipped to you when it is available.
	  You will only be required to pay Cost of Goods ($19.95 - subject to
	  change) and shipping and handling.
	
	Q. Why isn't this just a downloadable patch?
	
	A. Because DBCS was enabled in Visual FoxPro, the entire product is
	  affected. Therefore, you need to reinstall the product to update it.
	
	Q. What version of Windows NT do I need?
	
	A. Visual FoxPro 3.0b requires Windows NT 3.51. This is stated on the box
	  as a requirement and is also in the Readme.hlp file.
	
	
	
	Q. Why have I heard about a 3.0c release?
	
	A. Microsoft re-manufactured the 3.0b build and Microsoft's manufacturing
	  group considered using the name Visual FoxPro 3.0c. However, this name
	  was not adopted and there is not a version of Visual FoxPro 3.0c.
