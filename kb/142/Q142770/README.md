	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To find out how much physical memory is available on your computer, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
	  System Tools, and then click System Monitor.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Add Item.
	
	3. Click Memory Manager in the Category box, click Free Memory in the Item box,
	  and then click OK.
	
	The Memory Manager: Free Memory line chart that is displayed on the screen shows
	the amount of physical memory that is not currently in use. To remove any other
	charts that are displayed in the System Monitor window, click Remove Item on the
	Edit menu, click the chart that you want to remove, and then click OK. To change
	all the charts that are currently displayed from line charts to bar or numeric
	charts, click Bar Charts or Numeric Charts on the View menu. To modify how often
	the displayed charts are updated, click Chart on the Options menu.
