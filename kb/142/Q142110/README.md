	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run MSB Human Body, and try to print the driver's license to a
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 1200C printer, only the top half of the driver's
	license prints, and at one edge of the page, a message, "Not Enough Printer
	Memory -- See User's Guide" prints.
	
	This occurs when the HP DeskJet 1200C has 2MB of installed RAM. This is not
	enough memory to print the driver's license, which prints in landscape mode.
	Landscape requires more memory than portrait mode.
	
	This behavior may occur in MSB Ocean and MSB Earth, as well.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	According to Hewlett-Packard, the only resolution for this problem is to install
	2MB of additional printer memory.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	As of 10/31/95, the latest printer driver for the HP DeskJet 1200C is version
	3.4. This driver does not print the driver's license correctly unless the
	printer has 4MB of installed RAM.
