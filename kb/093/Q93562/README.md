	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0, has three ways of notifying you that
	new mail has arrived:
	
	- The mouse arrow turns into an envelope. For example, if you are in a Windows
	  application and new mail arrives, you'll see the arrow momentarily change to
	  an envelope, then back to an arrow. In other words, the envelope flashes.
	
	- When Mail is minimized and new mail arrives, you will notice letters sticking
	  out of the slot of the Mail icon. If the slot is empty, no new mail has
	  arrived.
	
	- You can choose to have your computer sound a chime when new mail arrives. To
	  do this, choose Options from the Mail menu, then select Sound Chime. If you
	  have a sound board, you can choose the Sound icon from the Windows Control
	  Panel. You will see an options for New Mail Notification where you can assign
	  a .WAV sound file. Then your computer will play the .WAV file when new mail
	  arrives.
	
	NOTE: Independent shareware developers have developed other methods of mail
	notification. More information on this topic may be available from Microsoft
