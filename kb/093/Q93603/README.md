	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	After Dark's MS-DOS-based screen saver, AD_DOS.COM, can corrupt the screen
	during MS-DOS Setup if it is allowed to clear the image on the screen and
	replace it with a screen saver image.
	
	Once the screen saver activates, you can return to a normal screen by pressing
	any key. However, if this occurs during Setup, the restored screen is filled
	with random characters. Setup continues to function correctly, but you may have
	difficulty understanding the prompts.
