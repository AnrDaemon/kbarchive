## Q93033: Cinemania: ListMaker Fails to Print Last Page

	Article: Q93033

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Cinemania for Windows 1992 edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print from ListMaker and the last page contains only one or two movie
	listings, Cinemania will not print the last page. Long lists (more than 20
	pages) will drop several pages. The amount of pages lost will increase as the
	list gets longer.
	
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Cinemania, version 1992. This
	problem was corrected in Cinemania, version 1994.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Listmaker file is a text file with a .LST extension saved in the VIEWER
	directory. Copy the file to a new name and open this file in a word processor
	for editing and printing. If you edit the original file, it will corrupt it and
	you will not be able to use it in Cinemania.
