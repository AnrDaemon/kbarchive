	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	IBM technical support has confirmed that its PS/2 N51SLC Laptop computer should
	be configured in Windows Setup as "MS-DOS System," not as "MS-DOS System with
	APM" or "Intel 386SL Based System with APM."
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Though the PS/2 N51SLC laptops do have power-saving features to extend battery
	life, they do not support advanced power management (APM).
	
	Setting up any machine for use with the Windows APM support that does not fully
	implement the APM specification can cause loss of data, system clock
	inaccuracies, or corrupted files.
