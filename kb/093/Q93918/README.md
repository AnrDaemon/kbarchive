	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When Windows Help topics are printed, the margins around the page are always one
	inch.
	
	As a help author, it may be desirable to set this margin to a smaller value so
	that more information can fit on the page. However, there is no interface to the
	Windows Help engine for a programmer to modify this value. One inch is the
	default margin size for the Windows Help engine and cannot be modified.
