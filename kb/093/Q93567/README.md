	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Choosing Select All from the Edit menu sometimes fails in folders that contain a
	large number of messages.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Select All function attempts to select as many messages as possible within a
	15-second time limit, and aborts the attempt if all messages are not selected in
	15 seconds.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The amount of available memory and the computer's processing speed both affect
	Select All; it may be successful if you can remove concurrently loaded
	applications or use a faster computer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
