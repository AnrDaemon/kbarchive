	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When playing an AVI file from the Media Player of Microsoft Video for Windows,
	the playback window may be sized by choosing the Configure command from the
	Device menu. This dialog box contains a Video Mode option box where you may
	select to play the file back in a window or full screen. Choosing Full Screen
	does not play the file back filling the entire screen for a typical 160 X 120
	video clip unless the Zoom By 2 check box is also selected. This feature is by
	design and holds true for all video drivers.
