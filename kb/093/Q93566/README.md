	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Mail for Windows may appear to hang (stop responding) when you print a
	large message from within a shared folder.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When Mail for Windows prints a message from a shared folder, it makes a
	temporary copy of the message and sends the copy to the printer without
	reporting progress to you during the copy phase of the process. If a message is
	particularly long or contains embedded objects, Mail may appear to be hung while
	it copies the message.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
