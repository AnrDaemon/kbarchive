	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	For a Microsoft Word 2002 version of this article, see Q290947.
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view a document, you may experience the following symptoms:
	
	- Menus and toolbars disappear from Word.
	
	- The screen may appear blank. The desktop may not be visible.
	
	- A small toolbar, consisting of one button.
	
	- If you press the ESC key, the words "Repeat Value:8" may appear at the bottom
	  of the screen.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You are in full screen view. Users who are accustomed to WordPerfect frequently
	work in this view.
	
	This view is useful if you want to see as much of the document as possible while
	you are working in it. If you do not see any part of your document, you are in
	full screen view with no document open.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To return to your usual screen, use one of the following methods.
	
	Method 1: If you are not using WordPerfect Keys or WordPerfect Help, press the
	ESC key.
	
	Method 2: If there is a document open, use the following steps:
	
	a. Press ALT+V to activate the View menu.
	
	b. Press U to turn off Full screen.
	
	  -or-
	
	- If the small toolbar is visible, click the button on the toolbar.
	
	Method 3: If there is no document open, use the following steps:
	
	a. Press CTRL+N to start a new document.
	
	b. Press ALT+V to activate the View menu.
	
	c. Press U to turn off Full screen.
	
	NOTE: If you saw the words "Repeat Value:8" at the bottom of your screen when you
	pressed the ESC key, you have WordPerfect Navigation Keys turned on. To disable
	WordPerfect Navigation Keys or WordPerfect Help, use the following steps:
	
	1. Press ALT+H to display the Help menu.
	
	2. Choose the WordPerfect Help command.
	
	3. In the Help For WordPerfect Users dialog box, click the Options button.
	
	4. Clear the Help For WordPerfect Users and Navigation Keys For WordPerfect
	  Users check boxes, click OK, and then click Close.
	
	You can now exit Full screen mode by pressing ESC.
