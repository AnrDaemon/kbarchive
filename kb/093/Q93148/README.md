## Q93148: Panasonic KX-P4420 May Not Print Large Documents

	Article: Q93148
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows Printing Issues

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use the Panasonic KX-P4420 laser printer with a third-party memory board,
	you may experience problems printing large print jobs from Microsoft Windows
	version 3.1.
	
	Microsoft Word for Windows, Aldus PageMaker, and Microsoft Windows Write may be
	unable to print more than five pages, and graphics may be printed partially or
	not at all.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may be caused by an incorrect jumper setting on a third-party
	memory expansion board installed on the printer. In this case, there is no
	indication of an error from the printer, and the printer memory appears to be
	used normally by the Windows printer driver. However, the printer cannot
	actually use the memory, and large print jobs cause the printer to jam.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Remove the memory board from the printer. This should allow the large documents
	to print normally. This may also help determine if the memory board is the
	source of the problem.
	
	For instructions on removing the memory board, contact your memory board
	manufacturer.
