## Q93150: HP Draftmaster Prints to Left Side of Page Only

	Article: Q93150
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) Draftmaster II plotter and a device option
	other than ColorPro, the plotter prints in the upper-left section of the page
	only. Text lines may start to wrap on the middle of the page, rather than the
	right margin, and graphics may print in a smaller size than specified.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The ColorPro device allows the use of paper size A only. The Draftmaster II
	option should allow use of multiple paper sizes; however, if an option other
	than ColorPro is selected, the plotter prints incorrectly or incompletely.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 3.1. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information as it becomes available.
