	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can print multiple documents with Windows 3.0 File Manager by selecting the
	files you want to print and then choosing the Print command from the File
	Manager File menu.
	
	Performing these same tasks in Windows 3.1 generates a dialog box listing the
	files to be printed. After you choose the OK button, you receive the following
	error message:
	
	  File Manager cannot print multiple files.
	  Select only one file, and then try again.
	
	This message also occurs when Print Manager is running minimized and you try to
	drag and drop multiple files onto the Print Manager icon.
