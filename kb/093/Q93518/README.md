	you restart the computer after installing Microsoft Mail. Remove GraceLan from
	the system folder for the Mail installation and the next reboot of the
	computer.
	
	After you have confirmed the Mail workstation is functioning correctly, you can
	return GraceLan to the system folder without problem.
	
	STATUS
	======
