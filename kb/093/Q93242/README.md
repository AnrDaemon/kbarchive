	When using a backup of your Mail Message File (MMF) in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2
	of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you sometimes can compose a message but cannot
	transmit it to the postoffice. The sent message just sits in your outbox.

	Make your backup MMF file your primary MMF file. Microsoft Mail will then send
	the message.

	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
