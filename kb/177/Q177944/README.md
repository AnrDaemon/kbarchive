{% raw %}

	Article: Q177944
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WinNT:5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 20-MAR-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Incoming and outbound Internet messages passing through an Exchange Server
	version 5.0 Internet Mail Service may appear to be spaced incorrectly. Though
	the messages may arrive and be readable in an Exchange or Outlook client, the
	RTFHTML converter that allows the item to be readable in an Outlook Web Access
	or Outlook Express (Internet mail) client will display the messages with
	incorrect line spacing.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.0.
	
	This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
	Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
	query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
	spaces):
