	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	After you complete directory synchronization between Microsoft Exchange
	Server and Lotus Notes, all the Lotus Notes users are represented on
	the Microsoft Exchange Server computer as Custom Recipients.
	
	On the Advanced tab of the properties page for one of the Lotus Notes
	Custom Recipients, the option to allow rich text in messages may be
	disabled. Toggling this option has no effect. All messages from an Exchange
	Server computer to Lotus Notes will maintain their rich-text properties.
	
	This behavior is by product design.
