	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Lexmark now provides a TCP/IP auto-discovery capability in its utilities,
	MarkVision for Windows 95, and MarkVision for Windows NT 4.0.
	
	TCP/IP auto-discovery allows you to:
	
	- Discover a specific TCP/IP printer on your entire network.
	
	- Discover TCP/IP printers on a specific subnet of your network.
	
	- Discover TCP/IP printers on a given TCP/IP printer's subnet.
	
	- Choose from the discovered list of printers, those to be monitored by
	  MarkVision.
	
	- Save the list of discovered printers to a file to be imported into MarkVision
	  running on another computer.
	
	- Integrate into DNS/WINS.
	
	The TCP/IP Auto-Discovery function runs on both Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.
	Microsoft's TCP/IP protocol stack (standard on both Windows 95 and Windows NT
	4.0) is required. You must install MarkVision for Windows 95 Version 3.03, or
	MarkVision for Windows NT 4.0 Version 3.03, before you install the upgrade.
