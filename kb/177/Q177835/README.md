	SYMPTOMS

	characters such as those used in International character sets in foreign
	languages (for example, ALT 0154,ALT 0225). Although the messages may arrive and
	be readable in an Exchange or Outlook client, the RTFHTML converter that allows
	the item to be readable in a Web access client displays corrupted characters.

	5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
