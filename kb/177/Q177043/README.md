	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In order to complete the River Outpost campaign, you must meet the following
	three conditions:
	
	- Secure the Island
	- Build a Town Center
	- Build two Guard Towers
	
	Once you have secured the Island, you can build a Town Center. You can build two
	Watch Towers before you advance to the Iron Age. However, to build a Guard
	Tower, you must have enough Food and Gold to advance to the Iron Age. In the
	Iron Age, you can conduct the research at the Granary that is necessary to
	upgrade the Watch Towers to Guard Towers.
