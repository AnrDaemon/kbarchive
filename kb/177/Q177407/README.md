	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you install Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows on a computer where Microsoft
	Word for Windows is installed, you may be able to use features that integrate
	the two products.
	
	Due to the design differences between 16-bit and 32-bit programs, 16-bit versions
	of Bookshelf can only be integrated with 16-bit versions of Word for Windows,
	and 32-bit versions of Bookshelf can only be integrated with 32-bit versions of
	Word for Windows.
	
	Because Word 2000, Word 97 for Windows, and Word for Windows 95 are 32-bit
	programs, you can only integrate these programs with the following 32-bit
	versions of Bookshelf for Windows:
	
	- Bookshelf 2000 for Windows
	- Bookshelf 99 for Windows
	- Bookshelf 98 for Windows
	- Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows
	- Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95
	
	Because Word for Windows, versions 6.0 and 2.0, are 16-bit programs, you can only
	integrate these programs with the following 16-bit versions of Bookshelf for
	Windows:
	
	- Bookshelf for Windows, 1995 Edition (Word for Windows 6.0 only)
	- Bookshelf for Windows, 1994 Edition
	- Bookshelf for Windows, 1993 Edition
	- Bookshelf for Windows, 1992 Edition
	
	  NOTE: Because of integration design changes in the 16-bit version of Bookshelf
	  95, you cannot integrate Word for Windows, version 2.0, with any version of
	  Bookshelf 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
