	- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to open a 360 Degree View in Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for
	Windows, an empty white box may appear instead of the 360 Degree View, and you
	may receive one or more of the following error messages:
	
	- This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
	
	- An operation could not be performed because a file handle could not be
	  opened. Try closing existing applications and/or increasing the number of
	  files available (see the "FILES" command in your DOS manual for more
	  information).
	
	- The QuickTime for Windows installation has not been completed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if there is not enough free space on your hard disk for
	Apple QuickTime VR to start. Bookshelf 98 uses Apple QuickTime VR to display 360
	Degree Views. If you have less than 20 megabytes (MB) of free space on your hard
	disk, QuickTime VR may be unable to start.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, increase the amount of free space on your hard disk by
	using one or more of the following methods:
	
	Method 1
	--------
	
	Empty the Recycle Bin. To do so, right-click the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop,
	and then click Empty Recycle Bin. When you are prompted to delete the files,
	click Yes.
	
	Method 2
	--------
	
	Back up and then remove data on the hard disk. For information about how to back
	up files, click Start, and then click Help. On the Index tab, type "backing"
	(without the quotation marks) and then double-click the "Backing up files"
	topic.
	
	Method 3
	--------
	
	Delete any unnecessary files from the hard disk. For information about how to
	delete files, click Start, and then click Help. On the Index tab, type
	"deleting" (without the quotation marks), and then double-click the "Deleting
	files or folders" topic.
