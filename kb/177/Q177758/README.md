## Q177758: Bookshelf: How to Use the Parental Control Feature

	Article: Q177758
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

	Operating System(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Macintosh 
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 99 
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 2000 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You can use the Parental Control feature of Microsoft Bookshelf to hide
	potentially offensive content. When enabled, the Parental Control feature hides
	articles in Bookshelf that contain words which are labeled as vulgar, vulgar
	slang, offensive, offensive slang, or obscene in the American Heritage
	Dictionary.
	
	Because many words have more than one definition or usage, some words that are
	not usually considered offensive may be hidden, and some words that are
	potentially offensive are not hidden. For example, the word "yellow" is hidden
	by Parental Control because one of its definitions is labeled as offensive, and
	the word "sex" is not hidden because none of its definitions are labeled as
	vulgar, offensive, or obscene.
	
	NOTE: This issue has been resolved in Bookshelf 99.
	
	You can enable or disable Parental Control at any time after you install
	Bookshelf. Parental Control restrictions are always applied to Bookshelf Daily
	and the QuickQuote tool, even when Parental Control is disabled.
	
	You can also restrict the ability to enable or disable Parental Control with a
	password.
