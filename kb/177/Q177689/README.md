	Page 11: Incorrect History of Cyrus the Great
	---------------------------------------------
	
	Page 11:
	Delete paragraphs 4 and 5 ("In B.C.546, Cyrus, the destroyer...")
	
	Replace with:
	"In B.C. 499, the Greek city-state of Athens earned the wrath of the Persian
	ruler, Darius I, for its support of the anti-Persian revolt of a Grecian colony
	called Miletus. Darius destroyed Miletus in B.C. 493 and vowed revenge on the
	Athenians.
	
	Darius sent a huge army to teach a lesson to Athens in B.C. 492. Athens asked
	another Greek city-state, called Sparta, for help. Unfortunately for Athens,
	Sparta was too busy with a religious ceremony to help when the Persian army
	arrived. Athens had to attend to Darius alone. Surprisingly, the Athenian army
	defeated the Persians without Spartan help." (without the quotation marks)
	
	Page 11, paragraph 6, sentence 1:
	Change: "In 480, Xerxes I, the son of Cyrus..."
	To: "In 480, Xerxes I, the son of Darius..." (without the quotation marks)
	
	
	Page 87: Guard Tower Should Be Watch Tower
	------------------------------------------
	
	Page 87, first screen shot caption:
	Change: "... build two guard towers."
	To: "... build two watch towers." (without the quotation marks)
