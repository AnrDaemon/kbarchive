## Q177631: Comdlg32 Fails to Display Drives Mapped by SUBST Command

	Article: Q177631
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): WinNT:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Drive letters mapped to other network drives by the SUBST command may not show
	up in the Drives box of a 16-bit Open common dialog box. This happens for all
	16-bit programs that use GetOpenFileName() to display the File Open common
	dialog box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Internally, there are two threads working together to display the Drives box;
	the lack of synchronization between those two threads causes the symptom
	described above.
	
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
