	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	You cannot use your pointing device to select more than one type of media from
	an article in Microsoft Bookshelf 98. For example, if you open the dictionary
	article about Christopher Columbus, you can use the pointing device to select
	either the article text or the image, but you cannot select both the text and
	the image at the same time.
	
	NOTE: This issue does not occur in Microsoft Bookshelf 99.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you want to copy text and media together from a Bookshelf 98 article and
	paste it into another program, use the following steps:
	
	1. On the Search All tab or the Find Media tab, click the article you want to
	  copy text and media from.
	
	2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.
	
	3. Switch to the program into which you want to paste the text and media you
	  just copied.
	
	4. On the Edit menu, click Paste.
	
	NOTE: Because these steps copy the entire contents of the article, you may want
	to delete unwanted sections of the article. To do so, select the text or media
	you want to delete, and then press the DELETE key.
