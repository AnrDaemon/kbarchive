## Q30534: M.EXE C Extensions Documented in UTILITY.DOC, Not README.DOC

	Article: Q30534
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 1.00
	Operating System(s): OS/2
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | docerr | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 26-MAY-1988
	
	Page 70 of the "Microsoft Editor User's Guide" incorrectly states
	the following:
	
	   "To create a successful C extension, you need to follow these
	guidelines:
	       1. Check the README.DOC file to see what functions you can call
	from the standard C run-time library."
	
	   Contrary to the above manual statement, C extensions are documented
	in UTILITY.DOC on the release disk, not in the README.DOC.
