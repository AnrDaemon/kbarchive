	The information in this article applies to:

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The copy utility Nokey that comes with CopyIIPC may cause problems with
	Microsoft Windows.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Early versions of Nokey require Nokey to be memory resident when you run a
	program that is not copy-protected. Later versions of Nokey perform a complete
	conversion and do not require Nokey to be present in memory.
	
	Any program that requires Nokey to be memory resident may not run in Windows and
	should be run from MS-DOS instead. Contact Central Point Software to determine
	if the version you are running needs Nokey in memory.
	
	The products included here are manufactured by Central Point Software, a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
