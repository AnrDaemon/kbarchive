## Q30515: /I Linker Option Should Read /INF

	Article: Q30515
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 3.61 3.65
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | docerr | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 18-OCT-1988
	
	Pages 266 and 267 of the "Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler CodeView and
	Utilities" manual for Versions 5.00 and 5.10 incorrectly list the
	shortened name of the /INFORMATION option as /I.
	
	If /I is given as an option, the result is an error stating that /I is
	an unrecognized option.
	
	The correct shortened name for /INFORMATION is /INF.
