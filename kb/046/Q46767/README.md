	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 2.0, 2.01, 3.0, 4.0

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you change the title text on a Slide Master, other slides in the
	presentation are not updated with the same slide title.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	PowerPoint is designed with the idea that each slide should have a unique title.
	The The Slide Master provides only the format, such as font, point size, and
	color, for each new slide title.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, use the appropriate method for your version of
	PowerPoint.
	
	PowerPoint 3.0, 4.0, 7.0
	------------------------
	
	If you want the same title on every slide, delete the title object from the Slide
	Master and use the Text Tool to type the title you want.
	
	PowerPoint 2.0
	--------------
	
	Because each slide must have a title, you cannot cut or delete the title field;
	however, you can achieve the effect of slides with the same title by deleting
	all the text from the title and using the Text tool to type your title on the
	Slide Master. Once you have deleted all the title text, you can locate the empty
	title field by turning on the Show Edges command on the Draw menu.
