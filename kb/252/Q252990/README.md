	In the Custom Installation Wizard, there is no entry for the personal address
	book (PAB) in the list of services that are available to configure profiles.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Outlook 2000, contacts are used for personal addresses and personal
	distribution lists. In an upgrade to Outlook 2000, the Personal Address Book
	service is available, but during a new installation of Outlook 2000, the
	Personal Address Book service is not installed.
	
	Outlook 2000 converts a PAB to contacts, if a PAB is detected.
