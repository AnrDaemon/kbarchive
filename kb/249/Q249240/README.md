	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to start Microsoft International Soccer 2000, you may receive
	the following error message:
	
	  Soccer 2000 does not support this resolution mode on this graphics card. Try
	  a lower resolution mode.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the video adapter installed in your computer does not
	meet the minimum system requirements for running International Soccer 2000.
	
	To run International Soccer 2000, a PCI video adapter with at least two megabytes
	(MB) of video memory is required.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Verify that the video adapter installed in your computer meets or exceeds the
	minimum requirements for running International Soccer 2000:
	
	1. Click Start, and then click Run.
	
	2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks).
	
	3. Click OK.
	
	4. Click the Display tab.
	
	5. Under Device, check the amount of memory listed next to Approx. Total
	  Memory.
	
	  NOTE: If a video accelerator card is installed in your computer, a Display 1
	  and a Display 2 tab are available. Click either tab to check the approximate
	  total memory.
	
	If the approximate total memory is more than two MB, and the issue continues to
	occur, contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to help determine how to
	best resolve this issue.
