	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, scenery colors and some graphics
	may appear distorted.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if an ATI Rage or an ATI Rage Pro video adapter is
	installed in the computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, download and install the latest version of the video
	driver for your ATI video adapter from the following ATI Web site:
	
	  http://www.atitech.com (http://www.atitech.com)
	
	You may be able to work around this issue by reducing the graphics hardware
	acceleration setting. To do this:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click System.
	
	3. Click the Performance tab, and then click Graphics.
	
	4. Move the "Hardware acceleration" slider one notch to the left of Full (the
	  "Most accelerator functions" setting).
	
	5. Click OK, and then click OK again.
	
	6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.
	
	If the issue continues to occur, repeat these steps to move the "Hardware
	acceleration" slider one notch further to the left. If the issue is not resolved
	after you move the slider all the way to the None setting, restore the original
	setting, and then download and install an updated driver for your video adapter.
