	- Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2000 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to install the entire CD-ROM or DVD-ROM contents of
	one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article to your hard disk.
	
	NOTE: If you have already installed one of the programs listed at the beginning
	of this article to run from the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive, with the exception of
	Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2000, you need to remove the program before
	you follow the steps in the "More Information" section of this article.
	
	This article applies only to the Encarta 2000 programs. Microsoft Encarta 2001
	contains a "Copy to Hard Disk" feature that you can use to copy the program to
	your hard disk. Note that Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2001 DVD-ROM version
	does not have the "Copy to Hard Disk" feature.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you install one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article to
	run from the hard disk, the program runs more efficiently because you no longer
	need to change CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs when accessing linked articles,
	interactivities, or videos. Additionally, you are not restricted by the slower
	speed of your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.
	
	NOTE: This type of installation requires approximately 650 megabytes (MB) of
	available hard disk space for each CD-ROM or as much as 8 gigabytes (GB) of
	available hard disk space for each DVD-ROM that you install to the hard disk.
	
	To install the entire CD-ROM or DVD-ROM contents to the hard disk:
	
	1. Create a folder for the product that you want to install:
	
	  a. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.
	
	  b. In the left pane, double-click the hard disk onto which you want to
	     install the Encarta program.
	
	  c. On the File menu, point to New, and then click Folder.
	
	  d. Type "EE2000" (without the quotation marks) for Microsoft Encarta
	     Encyclopedia 2000, or "ERS2000" (without the quotation marks) for
	     Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2000, and then press ENTER.
	
	2. Insert the first CD-ROM or DVD-ROM into the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. Press
	  and hold down the SHIFT key as you insert the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM to prevent
	  Setup from starting automatically.
	
	3. In the left pane, click the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.
	
	4. On the Edit menu, click Select All.
	
	5. On the Edit menu, click Copy.
	
	6. In the left pane, double-click the folder that you created in step 1, and
	  then click Paste on the Edit menu.
	
	  If you are prompted to replace any existing files, click Yes or "Yes to All."
	
	7. Repeat steps 2 through 6 for each additional CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.
	
	8. Insert the installation CD-ROM or DVD-ROM into the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.
	  Press and hold down the SHIFT key as you insert the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM to
	  prevent Setup from starting automatically.
	
	9. In the left pane of Windows Explorer, click the new folder that you created
	  in step 1.
	
	10. In the right pane, double-click the Setup.exe file.
	
	NOTE: Before you run the Setup.exe file from the folder that you created in step
	1, make sure that the Encarta Installation and Resources CD-ROM is in the CD-ROM
	drive. If you are installing the DVD version of Encarta Reference Suite 2000 or
	Encyclopedia 2000, click the article number below and follow the instructions in
	that article to properly install your Encarta program:

	11. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the Encarta program.
	
	12. If you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
	
	NOTE: To install your Encarta program on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer
	or a Microsoft Windows NT-based computer, you need to log on as an
	administrator. When the program is installed, other users can log on as guests.
	
	You can find the preceding information in the Nag.hlp file located on the Encarta
	Reference Suite 2000 Installation and Resources CD-ROM.
