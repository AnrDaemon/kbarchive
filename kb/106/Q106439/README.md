	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you type a message in WinPopup, many extended characters do not display
	correctly in the message area. For example, typing the extended character
	ALT+0149 normally displays a bullet, but in WinPopUp, a thin block is displayed.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	WinPopup uses a predefined original equipment manufacturer (OEM) character set
	that is limited to specific characters and cannot be modified.
