	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are typing in Creative Writer, the watch cursor may appear every time
	you type a letter. This occurs if the text on the line you are typing is
	formatted for a different size than the text on the previous line. This problem
	only occurs when the line height of the two lines is different.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0, 1.1
	and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To avoid this problem, you may want to type all your text first, then change the
	fonts or point sizes.
