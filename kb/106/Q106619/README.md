	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you try to start Help from Multimedia Works while Encarta Help is already
	running, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  Microsoft Works Cannot Run Help
	
	You also may receive a Segment Load Failure error in Mviewer2.exe if you close
	Encarta Help with the wrong CD-ROM is in the drive.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because Encarta and Works are both trying to run Viewer from
	the CD-ROM.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Encarta 1994, version 1.0. These
	problems are corrected in the Encarta 1994 maintenance release, version 1.0a.
	
	To obtain this release, contact the Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800)
	426-9400. In the maintenance release, Encarta runs Viewer from the hard drive.
	This allows Works and Encarta to each run different instances of Viewer.
