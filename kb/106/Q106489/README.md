	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	FoxPro for Windows requires a mouse. MS-DOS users who are used to using the
	keyboard for creating screens are often confused by the lack of keyboard support
	in the Screen Builder. In a graphical environment such as Windows, the mouse
	provides a more effective means of locating and/or moving objects than the
	keyboard does.
	
	To complete the transition from designing with the keyboard to designing with the
	mouse, icons have been added for every tool in the Screen Builder. These icons
	take the place of the menu shortcuts that exist in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
