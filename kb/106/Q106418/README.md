	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you force Workgroups Schedule+ to automatically load by placing it in the
	StartUp group or on the LOAD= line of your WIN.INI file, the cursor may remain
	as an hourglass until you move the mouse.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
	version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	This situation does not occur if you start Schedule+ by placing it on the RUN=
	line of your WIN.INI file. At this time, the only workarounds available are to
	use the RUN= line, move the mouse to restore the pointer, or not automatically
	load Workgroups Schedule+.
