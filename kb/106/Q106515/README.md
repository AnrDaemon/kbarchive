	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may not be able to import some graphic files into Creative Writer or Fine
	Artist. When you try to import the file, you may receive the following error
	message:
	
	  Hey!
	  Sorry, I can't get that picture. I can't open that picture for some
	  reason--there's a problem with the picture file. Try a different picture
	  file.
	
	This error occurs if you try to import graphic files that are not in a format
	that Creative Writer or Fine Artist supports. This may also occur with graphics
	that are in an older version of a supported format. WMF files, for example, must
	be in the format of Windows version 3.0 or later.
	
	Creative Writer and Fine Artist for Windows support the following graphic
	formats:
	
	- .BMP (bitmaps)
	
	- .WMF (Windows metafiles)
	
	- .DIB (device-independent bitmaps)
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you can import the graphic into another application, such as Paintbrush, you
	may be able to save the picture in a newer graphic format and then import it
	into Creative Writer or Fine Artist.
