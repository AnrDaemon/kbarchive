	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	When you run Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and are using two network
	cards, the IPX/SPX compatible protocol can be used on only one of the
	network cards. This is a limitation of the IPX protocol that has been
	carried over into Windows for Workgroups. All implementations of the
	IPX protocol have this same limitation.
