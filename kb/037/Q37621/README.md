	Question:
	
	How much disk space will I need to set up the Microsoft C Version 5.10
	Compiler in a minimum configuration for DOS?
	
	Response:
	
	In a minimum configuration, you will need to have about 1.45 megabytes
	of disk space available. This includes the small, medium, and graphics
	libraries and all include files and passes of the compiler.
	
	This does not include any user source code, temporary files, the
	Microsoft editor, CodeView or any utilities.
	
	Although you will be able to use the compiler in this minimum setup,
	we recommend that you have about 2.5 megabytes of disk space and do a
	complete setup.
