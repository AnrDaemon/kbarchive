	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When flying in the San Francisco vicinity, the Porterville Airport is visible
	upon approach. However, the airport will vanish when you come within
	approximately one mile.
	
	Also, if the coordinates for Porterville (16294 N, 5898 E) are entered on the
	Position Set menu (Nav/Com menu, item A), the airport will not be visible.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator versions 3.00
	and 4.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as
	it becomes available.
