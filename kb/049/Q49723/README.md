	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00, the spot plane doesn't recognize the
	aircraft carrier.
	
	If an airplane has landed on the deck of the aircraft carrier, the spot plane
	does recognize the aircraft carrier if the spot plane is set to an altitude of
	less than the aircraft altitude. The spot plane is looking at the bottom of the
	airplane, from a position within the unseen aircraft carrier.
	
	To set the spot plane altitude, press 2 for VIEWS menu, D for "SET UP SPOT
	PLANE...", and 2 for "ALTITUDE:". At the prompt, enter a value that is greater
	than the altitude of the aircraft (the altitude of the airplane is listed on the
	altimeter). The spot plane can now see the airplane on the deck of the aircraft
	carrier.
