	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you select a propulsion-source of "none" during aircraft design in Flight
	Simulator Version 4.00, the sailplane is the default configuration. You will
	notice that some options that are not applicable to the sailplane can still be
	changed (i.e., gear, fuel, capacity, and power).
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
