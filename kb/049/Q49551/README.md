	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following information concerning the use of Flight Simulator Version 4.00 in
	multi-player mode is taken from the README.DOC file:
	
	Multi-Player Information:
	-------------------------
	
	If you are not using a Hayes-compatible modem, select Option 1 (ON-LINE), then
	deselect Option 1 prior to selecting Option 3 (Messages/Talk to Modem). Turning
	Option 1 on and off has the effect of initializing the COM port buffer, and
	should be done before you "Talk to Modem" without prior selection of "DIAL" or
	"Wait for Ring" options.
	
	If you are using a joystick, you may have problems running Multi-Player at a high
	baud rate (19,200 baud or higher), particularly in sending and receiving
	aircraft. If you are using a joystick, it is best to set your baud rate no
	higher than 9,600.
	
	In Multi-Player, a baud rate of 57,600 is supported, but is not recommended. Its
	advantage is faster aircraft send/receive and messages, but it has no effect
	upon the smoothness of the other player's flight and can degrade system
	performance.
	
	When sending messages, limit the length of the message to what is displayed in
	the message box.
	
	When using the Sailplane in Multi-Player, the ADF tracking feature is not
	available due to the reduced Sailplane instrumentation.
	
	Multi-Player supports two players, not "two or more" as noted on Page 132 of the
	"Microsoft Flight Simulator" manual.
