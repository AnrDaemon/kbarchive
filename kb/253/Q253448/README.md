	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After Allegiance installs an automatic software update, the game continues to
	use the old default key assignments, and any new default key assignments
	included in the software update do not work.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the Auto Update feature in Allegiance does not
	reset the default key assignments.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, reset the default key assignments:
	
	1. Press ESC, point to Configure Input, and then click "Map Keys and Controls
	  C".
	
	2. Click Restore Defaults, and then click Accept.
