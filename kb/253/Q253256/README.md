	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The horizontal or vertical guides in PowerPoint may be unavailable even though
	Guides is selected (checked) on the View menu.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The horizontal or vertical guides may become unavailable if you adjust the slide
	size so that the guide is no longer visible in the slide area. If you only have
	one horizontal or vertical guide and it is positioned outside the visible slide
	area, you cannot create new guides of that type.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the File menu, click Slide Setup.
	
	2. Double each dimension of the slide size. For example, if your page size is 3
	  x 6 inches, change the size to 6 x 12 inches. When finished, click OK.
	
	3. If the guides appear, drag them toward the center of the slide area so that
	  they fit within the smaller slide size of the presentation.
	
	  NOTE: If the guides do not appear, repeat step 2.
	
	4. On the File menu, click Slide Setup.
	
	5. Return the page dimensions to their original size, and then click OK.
	
	The guides should now be available.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft PowerPoint 95.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Guides are straight lines, both horizontal and vertical, used to visually align
