	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When a Management agent (MA) is created, the "Write entries to the transactions
	stack during synchronization" setting is enabled by default. Microsoft
	recommends that you leave this default setting after your MA is fully
	operational. Also, you must use this setting to allow updates generated by the
	MA to be issued as delta updates by your other MAs.

	You may need to disable this setting when you are testing your MA. To do so:
	
	1. Log on to Compass with an administrator account.
