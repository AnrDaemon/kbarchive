	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Exchange Server Migration Wizard for Lotus Notes may not migrate items that
	exist only in the All Documents mail folder.
	
	The All Documents view is a complete catalog of all of the documents (messages)
	in the Notes mail database, which can contain items that are not in any visible
	folder.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, move the documents to a folder, such as the Inbox
	folder, the Drafts folder, the Sent Items folder, and so on.
