	SYMPTOMS

	While you watch a Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG) movie on a Windows
	2000-based computer, the Screen Saver may activate and you may no longer be able
	to see or hear the movie.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows 2000 does not prevent the Screen Saver from activating while you watch
	an MPEG movie.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	The following are ways to easily workaround this problem:
	
	- Disable the Screen Saver before you start an MPEG movie.
	
	- Set the Screen Saver's activation time to a time that is longer than the
	  length of the movie.
