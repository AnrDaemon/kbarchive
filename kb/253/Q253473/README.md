	From the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator console, you can remotely
	control a SMS client computer that has the Remote Tools Client agent installed.
	When you are controlling a remote computer, multiple program windows may be open
	on the target computer and the windows may overlap one another. The arrow button
	on the Remote Control window's title bar provides the task switching (ALT+TAB)
	function so that you can bring a program window to the foreground.
