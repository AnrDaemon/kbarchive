	SUMMARY

	article describes the new features that are included in this version, the system

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following issues are resolved in Outlook for Macintosh Exchange Server
	Edition 8.2.1:
	
	- Messages with a blank subject line could not be dragged from Outlook to the
	  desktop. Instead, the following error message was displayed:
	
	  The drag and drop operation could not be completed. An error occurred while
	  writing to the disk. The disk might be full or write-protected.
	
	- On a computer without security enabled, messages occasionally were not sent
	  the first time, and the Send button remained depressed.
	
	- If you copied or cut text from an e-mail message that contained a Uniform
	  Resource Locator (URL) and then closed the e-mail message, a message was
	  displayed that asked you if you would like to keep the large amount of text
	  on the clipboard.
	
	- If you pressed the CTRL key when you double-clicked a hyperlink in an e-mail
	  mail message multiple times, Outlook would stop responding.
	
	- Sometimes Outlook launched the Web browser to display the target of a
	  hyperlink in an e-mail message, even if that hyperlink was not clicked.
	
	- Japanese characters in e-mail messages that were received over the Internet
	  were sometimes displayed incorrectly in the Japanese version of Outlook.
	
	- If e-mail messages had multiple attachments and were forwarded from an
	  Outlook Web Access (OWA) client to Outlook for Macintosh Exchange Server
	  Edition 8.2, only the first attachment was displayed.
	
	- Web forms were not rendered in Outlook Web Access, even if the Web Services
	  information was correctly entered.
	
	- Outlook was unable to use Web Services with a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
	  secure (https://) Web server.
	
	- On a 68 kilobyte (KB) Macintosh, if you dragged attachments from an e-mail
	  message to an Exchange Server folder, you sometimes caused a Type 2 error.
	
	System Requirements
	-------------------
	
	Minimum:
	
	- Apple Macintosh with a 68030 or faster processor
	
	- System 7.5.5 or later
