	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Although e-mail provides an efficient and easy way to share information, you may
	run the risk of unknowingly opening an attachment that starts a program or
	executable code that could cause damage to your computer.
	
	Microsoft provides a security feature to provide you with a warning before
	attachments are opened. Microsoft encourages all MSN, The Microsoft Network,
	members who are using Microsoft Exchange versions 4.x or 5.x, Windows Messaging,
	or Microsoft Outlook 97 as their e-mail program to download the Mail Attachment
	Security Add-on for Microsoft Mail Clients. To do so, visit the following
	Microsoft Web site:

	If you use Microsoft Internet Mail and News, you can obtain a similar mail
	security attachment add-on by installing Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02. To
	obtain Internet Explorer 3.02, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Mail Security Attachment Add-on protects you from opening attachments that
	have been altered to start a program or executable code that might damage your
	computer. If the add-on detects that an attachment has been changed, you receive
	a warning message. You are then prompted to choose whether or not to open the
	attachment. In addition, you have the ability to bypass the warning for selected
	file types that you feel comfortable opening without a warning, as well as for
	executable code that is signed using Authenticode.
	
	Authenticode is a technology that software publishers use to sign their products,
	helping to ensure that content and files you download from the Internet are
	authentic and safe.
