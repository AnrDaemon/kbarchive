	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article is a pointer to a white paper available for download. The white
	paper discusses Windows NT security as it relates to Internet Information Server
	(IIS) so that you can effectively troubleshoot security- related problems. It
	covers the three forms of authentication, how they differ, several ways of
	controlling access to key areas on your Web server, and the important, but
	almost universally misunderstood, concept of "delegation." Understanding
	delegation is mandatory for anyone building a data driven Web site using IIS.
	Understanding how Windows NT handles different "users" will potentially save you
	days or weeks of troubleshooting.
