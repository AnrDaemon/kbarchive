	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A complete set of documentation for the Microsoft Routing and Remote Access
	Service (RRAS) for Windows NT Server is included in the expandable executable
	download. This article discusses where to find this documentation.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When the expandable executable file is first run, it creates a folder
	(C:\Program Files\Routing by default) and copies its expanded files into it. It
	also creates two subfolders: Doc and Support.
	
	The Administrator's Guide for Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service for
	Windows NT Server can be found in the Doc subfolder, in WordPad format. The
	Administrator's Guide is a comprehensive 185-page manual that provides detailed
	instructions for installing and configuring RRAS and its components.
	
	RRAS also includes several help files that are located in the RRAS expanded
	folder. Help is provided for:
	
	- Routing and RAS Administration
	
	- Remote Access Administration
	
	- RADIUS
	
	- Dial-Up Networking
	
	- Remote Access Setup
	
	- Remote Access Glossary
	
	For additional information on demand dial connections between RRAS servers,
	please see the following white paper available on the Microsoft anonymous ftp
	server:
