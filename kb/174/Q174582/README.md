	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Most computer books, including most Microsoft Press books, assume that the
	reader already has purchased and installed the related software that the book is
	written about. Without the software, the book may not be useful.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	As an example, "Microsoft Excel 97 Step by Step" requires that you already have
	Microsoft Excel 97 installed on your computer. Without Microsoft Excel 97, the
	Practice Files are not readable and the lessons in the book cannot be followed.
	
	Books that do not have a companion disk or CD-ROM are less dependent on the
	related software. However, we still recommend that you have access to the
	related software in order to practice with or use the information in the book.
	
	There are a few Microsoft Press books that do include a working model or
	time-limited evaluation edition of the related software. In very rare cases, the
	book might include a full version of the related software. These titles will
	specifically state, typically on the front or back cover of the book, that the
	book includes the related software. Some titles that come with a version of the
	related software include:
	
	- Learn Java Now
	
	- Learn Visual Basic Now
	
	- Learn Visual C++ Now
	
	- Microsoft Network Administration Training
	
	- Microsoft SQL Server Training
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Technical Support Training
	
	- Microsoft Visual Basic Deluxe Learning Edition
