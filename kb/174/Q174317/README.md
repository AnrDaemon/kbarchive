	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view a Web page that includes text in multiple languages, incorrect
	characters may be shown.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To correctly show the text typed in multiple languages, follow these steps:
	
	1. Open your multilingual Web page in Word.
	
	2. On the File menu, click Properties.
	
	3. In the Document Properties dialog box, under "For Saving This Page," click to
	  select the correct language set your document contains, and then click OK.
	
	  NOTE: This procedure works if your page contains text typed in a different
	  language in addition to English. If your page contains English and two or
	  more additional languages, there may not be a language encoding option
	  available to correctly show all of the text when viewed in a Web browser.
