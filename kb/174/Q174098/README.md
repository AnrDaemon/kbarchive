	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you join MSN, you can indicate whether you want to receive e-mail about new
	products, services, and discounts available only to MSN members from Microsoft
	and other featured companies. If you indicated that you would like to receive
	this type of e-mail when you joined MSN, you can remove your name from the
	mailing list by following these steps:
	
	1. Connect to MSN, and then access the following Web site:
	
	  http://memberservices.msn.com/feedback/optout.asp.
	
	2. On the Communication Preferences Web page, click the "I do not wish to
	  receive any unsolicited mail" check box to select it.
	
	3. Click Submit.
	
	These instructions apply only to e-mail sent by MSN. Just as the Postal Service
	cannot control every message sent through surface mail, MSN does not have
	control over e-mail sent through the Internet from outside of MSN. MSN does not
	provide your e-mail address to people who send "junk" e-mail. Instead, e-mail
	addresses can be collected from a variety of sources, including chat rooms,
	bulletin boards, and newsgroups. If you receive unsolicited e-mail, reply to the
	senders and ask them to remove your name from their mailing list. In addition,
	there are a number of Web pages that focus on the reduction of "junk" e-mail on
	the Internet. Use one of the Internet search engines to locate these Web pages.
	
	Sending unsolicited, commercially-oriented e-mail messages to MSN members is a
	violation of the MSN Membership Agreement. If you receive this kind of e-mail
	from an MSN member, please notify MSN Member Services.
	
	To report unsolicited or commercially-oriented e-mail messages to MSN Member
	Services, use the appropriate steps for your version of MSN:
	
	MSN 2.0
