	================
	
	Sending Attachments
	-------------------
	
	To send an attachment with your e-mail message, use the following steps:
	
	1. On the Insert menu, click File Attachment.
	
	2. Locate the file you want to attach, and then click Attach.
	
	  NOTE: MSN limits the size of attachments to approximately 2 megabytes (MB) per
	  e-mail message.
	
	Automatic Text Wrapping
	-----------------------
	
	To make the text wrap automatically in outgoing messages, use the following
	steps:
	
	1. On the Mail menu, click Options.
	
	2. On the Send tab, click Settings.
	
	3. In the Automatically Wrap Text At X Characters box, type the maximum number
	  of characters to display per line.
	
	This setting is only needed for messages sent with plain text format.
	
	Some servers do not display more than 80 characters per line. If you send
	messages with more than 80 characters per line, your message might not appear
	correctly to others viewing your message.
	
	When messages are quoted in a reply, the original text is usually marked and
	indented with an additional character. If your message is likely to be quoted
	after posting, set your text to wrap at 70 or 72 characters per line.
	
	HTML Formatting
	---------------
	
	To use HTML formatting in outgoing messages, use one of these methods:
	
	- On the Format menu, click HTML. This affects the current outgoing message
	  only.
	
	- To set all outgoing messages to use HTML, follow these steps:
	  1. On the Mail menu, click Options.
	
	  2. On the Send tab, click HTML.
	
	  3. Click OK.
	
	  All messages are saved in HTML format. If the recipient's mail or news program
	  reads HTML formatting, the message appears as it is formatted. If the
	  recipient's program does not read HTML formatting, the message appears as
	  plain text with an HTML file attached. The recipient can view the attached
	  file with HTML formatting by opening it in any Web browser.
