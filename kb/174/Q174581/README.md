	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The setup program included on the disk or CD-ROM with these books installs one
	or two icons on your desktop, Microsoft Press Welcome and "Camcorder Files on
	the Internet." Not every book will install the "Camcorder Files on the Internet"
	icon.
	
	If you double-click these icons you may receive in an error similar to the
	following:
	
	  Internet Explorer cannot open the Web site. The site was not found. Make sure
	  the address is correct, and try again.
	
	If you do not have a Web browser installed, you may see the Open With dialog box
	appear.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The icons installed on your desktop are hyperlinks to sites on the World Wide
	Web. The icons are not related to the practice files that you installed from
	your disk or CD-ROM. If you have Microsoft Internet Explorer or another Web
	browser installed, double-clicking on one of these icons will take you to the
	Microsoft Press Web site.
	
	Double-clicking these icons will only work if the following conditions are true:
	
	- You have Microsoft Internet Explorer or another browser that can be
	  automatically launched by a separate program.
	
	- You have an open, active connection to the Internet. If you use a modem to
	  connect to the Internet, you need to be connected to your Internet Service
	  Provider for these icons to work.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Make sure that you have the correct browser installed and that your connection
	to the Internet is open and active. For more information, please consult your
	Web browser documentation or your Internet Service Provider.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For information on using the practice files included on your disk or CD- ROM, as
	well as information on the World Wide Web shortcuts installed on your desktop,
	please see "Installing and Using the Practice Files" in the Getting Ready
	section of your book.
