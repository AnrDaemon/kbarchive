	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to use Microsoft Outlook Express and MSN, The
	Microsoft Network, to create and exchange e-mail messages with a Subscriber of
	MSN or another Internet service provider (ISP).
	
	NOTE: To use Outlook Express with MSN, you need MSN 2.5. The CD-ROM with the MSN
	2.5 upgrade is being shipped to all MSN customers. If you have not yet received
	this upgrade or if you want to continue to use your current version of MSN, you
	cannot use Outlook Express. To send and receive e-mail with MSN 2.0 and earlier,
	you need to continue to use Windows Messaging or Microsoft Exchange (the Inbox).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Outlook Express is a Post Office Protocol (POP3) e-mail client included with
	Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0. Internet Explorer 4.0 is available on the MSN
	2.5 CD-ROM. You can also obtain Internet Explorer 4.0 from the following
	Microsoft Web site:

	To Create and Send an E-mail Message
	------------------------------------
	
	1. In MSN Program Viewer, click Send Or Read E-mail on the Communicate menu. In
	  Windows 98 click Start, point to Programs, point to Internet Explorer, and
	  then click Outlook Express. If the MSN Sign-In screen appears, type your
	  Member ID and password, and then click Connect.
	
	2. In Outlook Express, click Compose Message.
	
	3. In the To box, type the recipient's e-mail address. For example, to send a
	  message to a MSN subscriber, type the following address
	
	  "<Member ID>@msn.com." (without the quotation marks)
	
	  where <Member ID> is the recipient's MSN Member ID. Note that the
	  address is not case sensitive.
	
	4. In the Subject box, type a title for your message. You are not required to
	  type any information in the Subject box, but it makes it easier for the
	  recipient to determine the nature of the e-mail message.
	
	5. Type your message in the message window. Internet standards limit messages to
	  64,000 characters, but files (for example, Microsoft Word documents) may be
	  attached to messages. MSN limits the total size of each message to 1.5
	  megabytes (MB). The total message size includes the message header, body, and
	  file attachments. To attach a file to your e-mail message, use the following
	  steps:
	  a. On the Insert menu, click File Attachment.
	
	  b. In the File Name box, type the path and name of the file you want to
	     attach to your e-mail message, and then click Attach.
	
	6. Click Send. If you are connected to MSN, the message is immediately
	  transferred to the e-mail server. A copy of the message is saved in your Sent
	  Items folder. If you are not connected to MSN, click Start, and then click
	  The Microsoft Network. If the MSN Sign-In screen appears, type your Member ID
	  and password, and then click Connect. In Outlook Express, click Send And
	  Receive to send your message to the MSN e-mail server.
	
	To Receive an E-mail Message
	----------------------------
	
	1. In Outlook Express, click Send And Receive. This sends a request to the MSN
	  e-mail server to deliver your e-mail messages. If the MSN Sign-In screen
	  appears, type your Member ID and password, and then click Connect.
	
	2. Double-click a message to open it. After you are finished reading the
	  message, click Close on the File menu. To delete a message, click the
	  appropriate message, and then click Delete on the Edit menu.
