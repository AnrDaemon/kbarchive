	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the Outlook Web Access client to compose or reply to a
	message, typing in the message body produces nothing. The subject line can be
	modified as needed; only the body of the message is affected. The same message
	text copied to an Exchange or Outlook client can be modified.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The maximum limit size for the message body text has been reached. When using
	the Web client, the message body text control has a maximum limit of 67 KB.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
