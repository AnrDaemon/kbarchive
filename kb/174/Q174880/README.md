	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5, the second half of the End User
	License Agreement (EULA) appears in French rather than English. This is by
	design because the English/North American version is distributed not only in the
	continental United States, but also in Canada and its French provinces.
	
	Additional query words: EULA
