	Article: Q174035
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:5.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	
	When a user configures the Internet Mail Service to forward all mail to a single
	host, a message sent to multiple addresses in different domains results in one
	copy sent for each domain. However, only one copy should be sent, because the
	user is routing all mail to a single host.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
	Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
	Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
