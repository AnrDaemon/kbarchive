	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to browse a folder, hard disk drive, or network share to create
	or add a personal folder (.PST) file or personal address book (PAB) file, you
	may receive the following error:
	
	  There are too many items in this folder. Some will not be shown.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You are attempting to create a file in a directory that contains more than 581
	subdirectories. This is a limitation of the Macintosh operating system and is
	not a problem with the Microsoft Exchange Client.
