	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you view the properties of a public folder, the "Propagate these properties
	to all subfolders" option on the General tab may not appear if the public folder
	does not have any subfolders.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To make this option available, create a subfolder for the public folder in a
	Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	For Exchange Server administrators who access public folders that do not have
	subfolders, this option can be overlooked when planning a public folder
	installation, or when disaster recovery requires the propagating of the
	permissions to all subfolders.
