	When you format the last paragraph mark in a Microsoft Word Document as hidden
	text, and then turn off the Show/Hide feature (click the Show/Hide button on the
	Standard toolbar), the following behaviors may occur.
	
	- Your insertion point moves to the left of the last character and you are not
	  able to move the insertion point to the right.
	
	  -and-
	
	- If text to the left of the last paragraph mark was underlined, Word may
	  remove the underline from the last word.
	
	NOTE: You can still type in hidden text in the "blank" region at the end of the
	document.
	
	WORKAROUND

	feature by doing one of the following:
