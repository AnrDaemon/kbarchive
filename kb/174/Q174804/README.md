	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Trends in Enterprise computing and the advent of the Inter/Intranet have made
	the use of server-deployed components increasingly desirable. By deploying
	business objects on Windows 2000 and NT Servers and centralizing administration,
	organizations can streamline their deployment strategies, increase security, and
	lower the cost of ownership for these components. Many Microsoft products,
	including Internet Information Server, Microsoft Transaction Server, and DCOM,
	make such deployments easy to set up and administer. Microsoft Visual Basic,
	Professional and Enterprise Editions, Version 5.0 allows the rapid production,
	debugging, and deployment of components that fully utilize these server-side
	architectures. Specifically, Visual Basic 5.0, with its ability to produce
	"apartment multi-threaded" ActiveX components, allows the developer or system
	architect to step into the world of highly-scaleable server-deployed Enterprise
	solutions. This downloadable document demonstrates how to develop these kinds of
	systems.
