	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you migrate cc:Mail users who have been using the Release 8 client, the
	Stationery, Preferences, and Rules folders used to store configuration
	information used by the client are migrated to Microsoft Exchange Server.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Each folder will contain a message without a subject line or message body. This
	is the expected behavior when extracting information using the Lotus cc:Mail
	Export utility. These folders and the messages they contain can be deleted after
	migration has been run.
