	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create a new appointment or meeting request, you may receive the
	following error message:
	
	  The end date you entered occurs before the start date.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs when you enter a meeting date and/or time in which the end
	of the meeting chronologically comes before the start date and/or time. For
	example, if you create an appointment that starts at 5:30 A.M. and ends at 5:00
	A.M. on the same day, you will receive the error stated above. This is by
	design.
