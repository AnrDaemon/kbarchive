	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are changing the import container in the cc:Mail Connector properties,
	you do not receive the option of deleting cc:Mail users on whom dirsync has
	previously been performed. The cc:Mail users remain in the previously selected
	container. Subsequent cc:Mail dirsync processes will import names in the new
	container.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5. We
	are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
