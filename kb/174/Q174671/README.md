	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the keyboard to fly in any of the programs listed at the beginning
	of this article, the game may not recognize keypad button presses.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:
	
	- You configure the keyboard on your laptop computer to emulate keypad signals.
	
	- The keyboard on your laptop computer sends non-standard signals for keypad
	  presses to the computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, connect a numeric keypad or an external keyboard with a
	numeric keypad to your laptop computer.
	
	To work around this issue, manually configure the keyboard controls in Flight
	Simulator or Combat Flight Simulator to assign all actions to standard,
	single-press keys on the keyboard. You can also purchase a USB Joystick to be
	used with the game.
	
	NOTE: Do not assign any action to an emulated key on your keyboard. As an
	example, if you have to press two keys on the keyboard to emulate the F1 key, do
	not assign any action to the F1 key.
	
	To configure the keyboard controls:
	
	1. If you are running Combat Flight Simulator, click Settings on the Options
	  menu, and then click Customize Controls.
	
	  If you are running Flight Simulator 98, click Custom Controls on the Options
	  menu.
	
	2. Under "Control device", click Keyboard, and then click the Assignments tab.
	
	3. In the Keyboard column, click to select Num 4. By default, this control is
	  located on the Left Ailerons or "Bank left (ailerons)" row.
	
	4. Click Assign, and then press the key you want to use for that action.
	
	5. Repeat steps 3-4 to change the key for any action that is currently assigned
	  to one of the following controls:
	
	  Num x
	  SHIFT+Num x
	  CTRL+Num x
	  CTRL+SHIFT+Num x
	
	  where x is any single-digit number, arithmetic symbol, or the word "Enter".
	
	6. If you have to press a key combination to emulate a function key, repeat
	  steps 4-5 to change the key for any action that is currently assigned to one
	  of the following controls
	
	  Fx
	  SHIFT+Fx
	  CTRL+Fx
	  CTRL+SHIFT+Fx
	
	  where x is any number from 1 to 12.
	
	7. When you finish customizing the controls, click OK. If you are running Combat
	  Flight Simulator, click OK again.
