	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you press ALT+TAB to switch away from a Wizard, you cannot switch back to the
	Wizard by pressing ALT+TAB again. If you are not using a mouse or the mouse is
	not currently functioning, there does not appear to be any way to switch back to
	the Wizard.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Wizards do not appear in the task list that appears when you press ALT+TAB
	because they are not executable programs.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the ALT+ESC key combination to switch to the Wizard, or click the Wizard
	with the mouse.
