	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you click Suspend on the Start menu, and then press the Suspend button on
	your Compaq Elite computer before the computer goes completely to sleep, the
	computer continually suspends and resumes. You must reboot the computer to
	regain control.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS in the Compaq Elite computer has
	trouble processing a software suspend request and a hardware suspend request at
	the same time.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	When you want to suspend your Compaq Elite computer, use either the Suspend
	command on the Start menu or the Suspend button on the computer itself. Wait for
	the suspend procedure to finish before you perform any other operation.
