	When you use the Samsung 2412 printer in conjunction with Windows or Windows for
	Workgroups, you may experience the following symptoms:
	
	- Blurry text or graphics near the the top of the printout.
	
	- Characters that may not be printed or that are cut off.
	
	NOTE: The Samsung 2412 does not have its own Windows 3.x printer driver, so you
	must use the Epson LQ800 or LQ850 printer driver.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Samsung 2412 printer may require a "logic board" upgrade to work properly
	with Windows 3.1x. This upgrade (fix) is available through an authorized Samsung
	Service Center.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Samsung has confirmed that some of the Samsung 2412 model printers encounter the
	above symptoms without the logic board upgrade.
	
	Contact Samsung Technical Support for more information concerning warranty
	service for the printer at (800)446-0262.
