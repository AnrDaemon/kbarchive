	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Creative Mixer (an audio mixer application that ships with the
	Creative Labs Sound Blaster AWE32) to set the volume of the MIDI music output,
	the master volume drops to zero and the balance jumps to the left channel.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In Creative Mixer versions 4.3 and earlier, there is a problem in the handling
	of the MIDI output line on the Windows 95 Sound Blaster AWE32 drivers.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Double-click the Speaker icon on the taskbar to start the Windows 95 Volume
	Control program. In the Volume Control window, you can set the volume and
	balance correctly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION

	from Creative Labs.
