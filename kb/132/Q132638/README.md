	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click Help from the Setup program for Carbon Copy, the Help window may

	=====
	
	Carbon Copy Help is hidden behind the Setup program for Carbon Copy.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the taskbar or press ALT+TAB to switch to the Windows Help window.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In versions of Windows prior to Windows 95, after Windows Help starts, the Setup
	program for Carbon Copy brings the Help window to the foreground. Because of the
	ability of Windows 95 to run multiple programs at the same time, Windows Help
	may not be fully started when the Setup program tries to bring it to the
	foreground.
