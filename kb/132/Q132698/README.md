	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Dogs for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Oceans for Windows, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft World of Flight for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you create a wallpaper image from within one of the programs listed at the
	top of this article, the size of the file is 0 bytes and the wallpaper is not
	saved.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If you don't have enough hard disk space when you click Make Wallpaper, no error
	message appears. Instead, the program creates a 0 byte-sized file in the Windows
	folder named Msdogs.bmp, Msoceans.bmp or Msflight.bmp, depending on the
	application in use.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Make additional hard disk space available, then click Make Wallpaper.
