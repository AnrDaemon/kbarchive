	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you save a PowerPoint 95 presentation with embedded fonts as a PowerPoint
	4.0 presentation, the font embedding information is lost.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 7.0 for
	Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If your presentation uses fonts that you suspect may not be available on other
	computers you may show it on, you will have to bring a copy of those fonts along
	with your presentation. To do this:
	
	1. Copy the font file(s) from your computer to a floppy disk. The font files
	  will have .ttf extensions and will typically be found in your Windows\Fonts
	  folder (Windows 95) or your Windows\System directory (Windows NT).
	
	2. Install the fonts on the destination computer by running Control Panel and
	  choosing Fonts.
	
	For more information on installing fonts in Windows 3.x, Windows NT, or Windows
	95, please consult your documentation or online help.
	
	NOTE: Some TrueType fonts have copyright restrictions. Check the license
	agreement that came with your TrueType fonts before copying them to other
	machines.
