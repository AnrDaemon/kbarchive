	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Encarta animations that have previously worked, fail to play.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This can occur if components of Encarta have been moved to other folders or hard
	drives since installation.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Move the Encarta Projector to the drive where Encarta was originally installed.
	This should be the startup (drive that contains the system folder) drive.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Encarta installs to the startup drive on a Macintosh. When components are moved
	after installation, Encarta has difficulty locating the components. Encarta and
	the Animation Launcher are unable to play animations without Encarta Projector.
