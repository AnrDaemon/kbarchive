	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you change the vertical and horizontal icon spacing, the spacing for icons
	in folders showing large icons is not adjusted unless the Auto Arrange option is
	enabled for that folder.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Click Line Up Icons on the View menu to arrange the icons with the new spacing.
	Or, enable the Auto Arrange option. To do so, point to Arrange Icons on the View
	menu, then click Auto Arrange.
	
	NOTE: To apply a view option to all folders that have not been opened yet, press
	and hold down the CTRL key after you make a change when you close a folder.
	Folders that have already been opened and customized are not affected.
