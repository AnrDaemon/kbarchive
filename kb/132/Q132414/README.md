	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you choose to have Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 stretch background bitmaps
	(or wallpaper) to fit the screen, some bitmaps may appear distorted.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior depends on the bitmap you are using. If the bitmap's aspect ratio
	(the ratio of height to width) is not the same as that of the monitor, the
	bitmap may appear distorted as a result of the stretching process. There is no
	way to work around this behavior. If the bitmap appears distorted, you may want
	to use another bitmap or choose not to use the "Stretch desktop wallpaper to fit
	the screen" option.
