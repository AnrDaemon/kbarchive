	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you resize the Windows 95 desktop, some dialog boxes may no longer be
	displayed properly, and you may not be able to access the fields and buttons at
	the bottom of a tall dialog box.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When you resize the desktop, Windows 95 resizes all the windows that are too big
	to fit in the new desktop area. If the taskbar is larger than its default size,
	some dialog boxes may be clipped.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To ensure that all dialog boxes fit properly, leave the taskbar at its default
	size.
