## Q132771: Lotus Programs Have Distorted Buttons on Title Bar

{% raw %}

	Article: Q132771
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the Close button in the upper-right corner of some Lotus
	programs, the icon turns into a Help icon that is not functional. Other
	miscellaneous icons or buttons may also appear.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Lotus programs expect a certain layout for the icons on the title bar. Because
	of the changes in the Windows 95 interface, these icons are no longer where the
	Lotus programs expect them to be.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	At present, there is no workaround to this behavior; however, this behavior does
	not affect the Lotus applications' functionality.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following Lotus programs are known to exhibit this behavior:
	
	- Lotus Approach 3.0
	
	- Lotus 1-2-3
	
	The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
	of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
	products' performance or reliability.
