	SUMMARY

	The "Desk Accessories" are still available in Visual FoxPro but are now
	undocumented. They are included for backward compatibility only and are not
	documented in the books or Help files with the exception of the FILER Command.
	New applications should not use them because they may not be supported in future
	versions.
