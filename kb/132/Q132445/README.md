	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you use the Mitsumi CD-ROM driver (MITSUMI.SYS) provided with Windows NT, or
	the Mitsumi proprietary CD-ROM driver (16-bit I/F, model number 74- 1645A) for a
	Mitsumi CRMC-FX001D CD-ROM drive or a Sound Blaster CT1750 Multi-CD-ROM drive,
	File Manager stops responding (hangs) when you choose the CD-ROM drive icon.
	
	This problem occurs when a compact disc is not present in the CD-ROM drive.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, ensure that a CD is in the CD-ROM drive when you
	choose the File Manager CD-ROM drive icon.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
