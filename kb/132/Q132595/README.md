	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using the Quick View feature of Windows 95 to view a file created
	with a version of Lotus 1-2-3 prior to version 3.0, the file does not appear
	correctly. In particular, cells containing times may not appear correctly or may
	not appear at all.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Versions of Lotus 1-2-3 prior to version 3.0 are not supported by Quick View.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To use Quick View to view Lotus 1-2-3 files, upgrade to Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0
	or later. To view files created with a version of Lotus 1-2-3 prior to version
	3.0, you must use the version of Lotus 1-2-3 that was used to create the file or
	some other application that can read Lotus 1-2-3 files.
