## Q132592: XTreeNet 3.0 Blocks Use of ALT and CTRL Keys

{% raw %}

	Article: Q132592

	Version(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	XTreeNet uses the ALT and CTRL keys to open XTreeNet menus. This behavior
	conflicts with the Windows 95 system keys.
	
	If you start Xtnet.com with Windows Explorer, the program will run but it blocks
	the ALT+TAB, CTRL+ESC, and ALT+ENTER key combinations. The only way to access
	another program is to exit XTreeNet.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	XTreeNet is an older MS-DOS-based program that was not written to be compatible
	with Windows.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Start XTreeNet in an MS-DOS session. The ALT and CTRL keys will open XTreeNet's
	menus, but the Windows system keys will still function.
