	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Pressing the right ALT key in an ALT+ENTER key combination may not switch an
	MS-DOS session between windowed and full-screen mode.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In non-U.S. keyboard layouts, the right ALT key is not an ALT key. It is the
	ALTGR key, which is used to enter national language characters.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To switch an MS-DOS session between windowed and full-screen mode, use the left
	ALT key in the ALT+ENTER key combination.
