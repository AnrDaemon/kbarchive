	Item ID   Filename       Description
	-------   --------       -----------
	
	S15346    MFCPART3.EXE   The MFCPART3.EXE file contains the source code
	                        for the article named "Programming Windows 95
	                        with MFC, Part III: Processing Mouse Input,"
	                        by Jeff Prosise.
	
	                        Learning how to handle input under Windows 95 is
	                        largely a matter of understanding the various
	                        event messages. Jeff Prosise develops two sample
	                        programs: one that shows how applications respond
	                        to mouse button clicks and one that demonstrates
	                        mouse capture.
	
	S15350    SKETCHSC.EXE   The SKETCHSC.EXE file contains the source code for
	                        the article named "Rewriting the MFC Scribble
	                        Program Using an Object-Oriented Design Approach,"
	                        by Allen Holub.
	
	                        While Allen Holub likes and uses MFC, he's a
	                        stickler for object-oriented design techniques.
	                        So here he presents Sketch-his version of the
	                        classic MFC Scribble tutorial, rewritten to serve
	                        as a model of good object-oriented design using
	                        MFC.
	
	S15351    NTSERVER.EXE   The NTSERVER.EXE file contains the source code for
	                        the article named "Tips and Tricks on Developing
	                        Killer Server Applications for Windows NT," by
	                        Martin Heller.
	
	                        Conventional wisdom has it that C programmers who
	                        write straight to the Windows API are going the
	                        way of the apatosaurus. Not so, says Martin
	                        Heller. He details how to design and build a great
	                        server application by properly exploiting the
	                        Win32 API.
	
	S15352    CPPQ0895.EXE   The CPPQ0895.EXE file contains the source code for
	                        the C/C++ Q&A column by Paul DiLascia, page 99.
	
	S15353    OLEQ0895.EXE   The OLEQ0895.EXE file contains the source code for
	                        OLE Q&A column by Don Box, page 77.</BLOCKQUOTE>
