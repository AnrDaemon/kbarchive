	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run Microsoft Font Assistant in Windows 95, you see no fonts or only a
	few of the fonts installed on the computer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows 95 has moved the installed font list from the [fonts] section of the
	Win.ini file to the registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
	CurrentVersion\Fonts and moved the font files to the C:\Windows\Fonts folder.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the Fonts folder in Windows 95 to manage your fonts or contact your
	third-party Font Manager vendor for a version compatible with Windows 95.
	
	To use the Windows 95 Font Manager, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel on
	  the menu that appears.
	
	2. Double-click the Fonts folder.
	
	3. Double-click the Font icon to view that font.
