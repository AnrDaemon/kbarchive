	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When an MS-DOS graphics program is running and the computer makes a sound, the
	system does not generate a screen flash (a visual cue that a sound has
	occurred), even though the SoundSentry option in the Accessibility Properties
	dialog box is checked.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Windows 95 SoundSentry feature does not support screen flashes when the
	display is in an MS-DOS graphics program.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	If you require the SoundSentry features for MS-DOS graphics programs, install
	Access Pack for MS-DOS, and run the full-screen graphics program in MS-DOS mode.
