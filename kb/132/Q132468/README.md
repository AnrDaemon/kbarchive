	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Encarta, you may receive the following error message:
	
	  Cannot load the [MCI] Microsoft MCI driver for MMP driver. The driver may be
	  missing. Try reinstalling the driver again or contact your system
	  administrator.
	
	When attempting to run Media Player, you may receive the error:
	
	  Undetectable problem in loading the specified device driver.
	
	Additionally, the Microsoft MultiMedia Movie Player option may be missing or
	unavailable on the Media Player Device menu.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	You may receive the messages if the file Mmp.dll is missing from the
	\Windows\System folder.
	
	Microsoft Encarta 1995 does not install the Mmp.dll file. The file is not located
	on the Encarta CD-ROM. By design, animation files (.mmm) play correctly from
	Encarta without the presence of Mmp.dll.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Ignore the error message. The animation files should play normally.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Products that contain the file Mmp.dll include, but are not limited to,
	Microsoft Bookshelf 1994 edition for Windows, Microsoft Encarta 1994 edition for
	Windows, Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, Microsoft Dinosaurs for
	Windows and Microsoft Ancient Lands for Windows.
