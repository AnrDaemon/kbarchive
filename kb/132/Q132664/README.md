	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use the File Type dialog box to change a file's association, the new
	association may not take effect; that is, it may revert to its old association.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The new association may not take effect because of slightly corrupted file type
	information in the registry that the File Types dialog box does not handle
	properly.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	In the File Types dialog box, first remove the old association completely, and
	then add the new association.
