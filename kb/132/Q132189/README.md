	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The font of the first character of a bulleted line determines the font used for
	the bullet when you use bullets from Normal Text. This behavior is normal for
	the bullet feature in PowerPoint.
	
	If you click Bullet on the Format menu, and click [Normal Text] in the Bullets
	From list, the diagram of available bullets is drawn using the font of the first
	character of the currently selected paragraph.
	
	This means that if you change the font you are using in a bulleted list, the
	bullet also changes.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you want to make sure that every bullet in your bulleted list remains the
	same, even if you change the font of the text, you can try one of the following
	methods.
	
	Method 1: Select Something Other than [Normal Text]
	---------------------------------------------------
	
	1. On the Format menu (or the Text menu if you are using PowerPoint 3.0), click
	  Bullet.
	
	2. In the Bullets From list, select something other than [Normal Text].
	
	3. Select a bullet from the character map.
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	Now, no matter what font you use in your list, the bullet retains the formatting
	you selected in step 3.
	
	Method 2: Change the Font at the Beginning of the Line
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	This method may not work for everyone. This example uses Times New Roman, but you
	can choose a different font to achieve the bullet style you want.
	
	1. Click at the beginning of the line on which you want to fix the bullet.
	
	2. On the Format menu (or the Text menu if you are using PowerPoint 3.0), click
	  Font.
	
	3. Change the font to Times New Roman.
	
	4. Type a space character at the beginning of the line.
	
	Because the first character of the line is now Times New Roman, the bullet is
	also formatted in Times New Roman.
