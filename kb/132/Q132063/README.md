	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Brief disk activity may occur after you see the "It's now safe to turn off your
	computer" screen.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The disk activity that occurs after you see the "It's now safe to turn off your
	computer" screen does not write any data to the hard disk and is not a source of
	potential data loss. All disk data in memory is written to the hard disk before
	you see the "It's now safe to turn off your computer" screen. After you see this
	screen, any additional disk activity is the result of multiple hard disk reset
	commands.
