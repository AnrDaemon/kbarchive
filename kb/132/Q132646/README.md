	If you perform a warm undocking operation with a full-screen MS-DOS session

	When a full-screen MS-DOS session is running, the program that changes the
	screen resolution between docking sessions can lose the proper settings.

	Warm undocking while a full-screen MS-DOS session is active is not supported by

	Before you perform a warm undocking operation, press ALT+ENTER to change the full
