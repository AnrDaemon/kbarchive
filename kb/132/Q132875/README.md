	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are running the Microsoft Exchange Setup Wizard, information that you
	entered in a previous page is discarded if you back up to that page.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design. The Wizard retains all the information entered in
	the provider pages as long as you remain in the provider pages section or move
	forward. If you back out of the provider pages section, the Wizard discards all
	data and resources entered up to that point and reverts to the default entries.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You must enter the information again when you return to the section.
