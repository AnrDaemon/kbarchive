	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, it may be
	necessary to retrieve calendar information from an archived Schedule+ file and
	place that information back into the working calendar file. The reasons may vary
	from accidentally archiving your entire schedule to having a corrupt .CAL file
	and needing to create a new one.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To transfer the information from a Schedule+ archive file into a working
	Schedule+ calendar, do the following:
	
	1. From the File menu, choose Open Archive.
	
	2. After the archive window appears, export the appointments in a .SCH format;
	  from the File menu, choose Export Appointments.
	
	  This will force all appointments to be exported to a file.
	
	3. When the export is completed, select your working schedule window, and from
	  the File menu, choose Import Appointments. Locate the .SCH file that was just
	  exported.
	
	4. At the Import Format dialog box, select Import File From: Schedule+, and
	  click OK.
	
	  This will begin importing the appointments into the current calendar.
	
	For additional information on archiving, please see Schedule+ on-line help.
