	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In MS-DOS Editor, when you use the CTRL+Q+Y key sequence to delete text from the
	pointer to the end of the line, the operation deletes the whole line.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The CTRL+Q+Y functionality was not implemented correctly in Windows 95. In
	Windows 95, this key sequence duplicates the CTRL+Y functionality.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
	this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
	as it becomes available.
