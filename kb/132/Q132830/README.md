## Q132830: Some Start Menu Icons Different After Upgrading from Win 3.1

	Article: Q132830
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you upgrade from Windows version 3.1 to Windows 95, some program icons on
	the Start Menu do not look the same as they did in Windows 3.1.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Some programs on compact discs do not copy the program icon to the local disk
	when they are installed; therefore, when you upgrade to Windows 95, the new
	shell cannot extract the appropriate icon and instead uses a generic one.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To have the new shell extract the appropriate icon, insert the compact disc in
	the CD-ROM drive and run the program.
