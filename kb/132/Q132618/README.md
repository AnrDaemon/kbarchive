	Article: Q132618
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you rename a file with a registered extension (for example, a .txt file) in
	Windows Explorer or in My Computer, and then you attempt to resize the Windows
	Explorer or My Computer window, you receive the following message:
	
	  If you change a filename extension, the file may become unusable.
	
	  Are you sure you want to change it?
	
	When you attempt to click the Yes or No button to clear the Rename dialog box,
	the dialog box does not clear. The dialog box and the Windows Explorer or My
	Computer window have stopped responding.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Although the Rename dialog box does not respond to mouse clicks, it does respond
	to keystrokes. Therefore, you can clear the Rename dialog box and return to the
	Windows Explorer or My Computer window by pressing the Y key (for the Yes
	button) or the N key (for the No button).
	
	
	STATUS
	======

	this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
