	The drive list in ScanDisk is static. The list is generated when you start
	ScanDisk and it is not updated while ScanDisk is running. If you add or remove
	drives (such as PCMCIA drives or DriveSpace-compressed drives) while ScanDisk is
	running, the list is not updated to reflect the changes.
	
	To update the drive list, exit and then restart ScanDisk.
