	S15344    MFCPART1.EXE   The MFCPART1.EXE file contains the source code
	                        for the article named "Programming Windows 95

	                        We know you've been putting it off, but it's
	                        becoming more of a pain to program Windows with
	                        vanilla C than it is to use C++ classes and
	                        an application framework such as MFC. Get started
	                        with our new series that will ease you into using

	                        Delphi offers an object-oriented version of Pascal

	                        based programs. It also provides you with a strong
