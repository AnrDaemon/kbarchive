	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you paste text to Microsoft Windows Write, the text usually appears in the
	font you are using in Write. However, when you paste from one Write document to
	anther Write document, the text appears in its original font.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If Write "document A" is open when the text is pasted to Write "document B," the
	original formatting is retained in document B. You can work around this behavior
	by cutting or copying the text from Write document A, closing document A and
	then pasting the text into document B. The text in the Clipboard loses its
	formatting as soon as Write document A is closed. When pasting into Write
	document B, the text appears in the format of that document.
