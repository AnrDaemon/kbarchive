	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When importing Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft Write converts only those
	fonts that are available to it at the time of the conversion. Font availability
	is determined by the Windows printer driver that is selected at the time of the
	file conversion.
	
	Fonts and font sizes that the Windows printer driver does not support for Write
	are automatically set to Courier 12 point.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Fonts can be changed before or after the conversion to Write format. Directions
	on how to change a font in Word and Write can be found in their respective
	manuals.
