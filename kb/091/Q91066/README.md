	If you perform any operation on a Microsoft Mail message, the letter
	icon at the left of the message subject is dimmed and open as if you
	had read it. This happens if you move, print or copy a message. This
	behavior is by design. The read status icon is a signal that the
	message has been "dealt with," not necessarily that it has been read.
