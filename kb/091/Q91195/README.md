	This information is incorrect. Microsoft does not assign XNS network numbers. We

	The cover letter states:
	
	  Microsoft is committed to supporting 3Com 3Server hardware at least through
	  December 31, 1993.
	
	Microsoft does not support 3Com 3Server hardware; we do support LAN Manager on
	the 3Server platform. Customers must refer to 3Com for hardware support and
	replacement parts.
