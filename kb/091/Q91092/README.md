	achieve this, it may bring up a dialog box to attach a specific user to a
	NetWare server. The Help button on this dialog box does not work.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
	3.1. This problem does not occur in later versions of the product.
