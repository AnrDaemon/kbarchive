	Version(s): 3.0,3.2
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.0 
	- Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Upgrade for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows
	for Workgroups or version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Upgrade for
	Windows for Workgroups to upgrade a Windows for Workgroups postoffice to a
	version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice, you receive this prompt:
	
	  Install Enhanced Security (Y/N)
	
	If you select "N," a second prompt appears:
	
	  Uninstall previously Enhanced Security (Y/N)
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Select "N." This question is not applicable because the Windows for Workgroups
	postoffice initially does not use enhanced security.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
	and Schedule+ Extensions for Windows for Workgroups or version 3.2 of Microsoft
	Mail and Schedule+ Upgrade for Windows for Workgroups. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
	becomes available.
