	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	QuarterDeck's QEMM LASTDRIVE program is incompatible with Windows for
	Workgroups.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you try to add drive letters using QEMM's LASTDRIVE program, Windows for
	Workgroups connects the drive but doesn't show any directory entries or file
	information. Also, if you run MS-DOS Prompt, you can't switch to the connected
	drive.
	
	NOTE: The MS-DOS LASTDRIVE= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file works correctly.
