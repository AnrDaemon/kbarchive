	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you press the F7 key to spell check a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows and try to add a misspelled word to your custom
	dictionary, Microsoft Mail tells you that no custom dictionary has been opened.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The custom dictionary was larger than the maximum 103K that Microsoft Mail for
	Windows can load. Microsoft Mail should warn you when the custom dictionary is
	too large to load.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
	Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
