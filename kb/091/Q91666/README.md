	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you format a disk in File Manager, the Label field in the Format Disk
	dialog box may not allow you to enter a full eleven-character disk label because
	Windows uses a proportional font for this field. If you choose a wide character,
	such as a "w," you may only be able to fit eight characters in the field.
	
	If you cannot enter the necessary disk label, use the MS-DOS LABEL command to
	change the disk label after you have formatted the disk.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows and Windows for
	Workgroups 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information
	here as it becomes available.
