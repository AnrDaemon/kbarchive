	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you run version 3.0 of Extensions for Windows for Workgroups on a Windows
	version 3.1 for Workgroups postoffice, the network name is not displayed in the
	Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) under External- Admin. This is because
	the NETWORK.GLB file has yet to be created.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Extensions for Windows for
	Workgroups, version 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To create the NETWORK.GLB file to reflect the current network listing:
	
	1. From within ADMIN.EXE, select Password from the Configure menu.
	
	2. Press the UP ARROW once, and then press ENTER four times.
	
	The network name now displays correctly.
