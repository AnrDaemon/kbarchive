	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail/Schedule+ Auto-Demo, version 3.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Microsoft Mail/Schedule+ Auto-Demo does not work under Norton Desktop for
	Windows (NDW).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Microsoft Mail demo uses Macro Recorder, which makes a call to Program
	Manager (PROGMAN) to start the demo. When Norton Desktop for Windows is
	installed, Program Manager is not available.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft
	Mail/Schedule+ Auto-Demo. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
