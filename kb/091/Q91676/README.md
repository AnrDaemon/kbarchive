	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	TV Link is a device that allows users to connect their computers to television
	and video tape hardware. Any computer configured with a VGA compatible output
	device may use TV Link's ability to output to RCA, S-3, or RGB type outputs.
	
	There are some display drivers for Microsoft Windows that ship on disks with the
	product; however, the use of these drivers is not required.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	TV Link loads one terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR), TVLINK.COM, in the
	AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This TSR allows any 640 x 480 display with any number of
	colors to be displayed on your television. TV Link can unload TVLINK.COM by
	running UNTVLINK.EXE. Both programs are on a disk included with the unit.
	
	TV Link digitizes the VGA output of the computer. Any VGA or SVGA resolution at
	640 x 480 pixels (and up to 16 million colors) can be input by the unit. It is
	the use of Digital Signal Processing that allows the VGA output to be
	manipulated with minimal distortion.
	
	TV Link is manufactured by KDI, Inc. For more information regarding this product,
	contact KDI, Inc.
	
	TV Link is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
	warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
	reliability.
