	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The REDISTRB.WRI file included with Visual C++ 32-bit Edition lists those files
	that can be legally redistributed with applications created with Visual C++ for
	Windows NT. The REDISTRB.WRI file does not list MSVCRT10.DLL; however, this file
	is also legally redistributable.
	
	MSVCRT10.DLL is needed by applications that have been built to use the
	dynamic-link library (DLL) version of the C run-time library. It is legal for
	registered owners to redistribute MSVCRT10.DLL with applications created with
	Visual C++ for Windows NT.
	
	MSFRT10.DLL shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for Windows NT,
	version 1.0 is also redistributable. This DLL contains the dynamic-link library
	version of the FORTRAN run-time library.
