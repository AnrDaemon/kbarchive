	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	On long music segments, you may find that the Pause button that displays when
	Schubert or Beethoven plays audio reverts to being a Play button (Beethoven text
	unhighlights) even though the audio segment has not finished playing. 112493

	This occurs on computers that have marginal MPC, CPU, and transfer performance.
	This problem should not occur on computers that are fully MPC-compatible.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Schubert version 1.0 and
	Beethoven version 1.0 when running on a computer that is not fully MPC
	(multimedia PC) compatible.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
