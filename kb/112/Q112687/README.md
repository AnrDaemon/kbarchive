	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to create a bitmap (.BMP file) from the desktop
	wallpaper in Windows. You can use this procedure, for example, to make tiled
	wallpaper for use in Microsoft Scenes.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To create a bitmap from a Windows wallpaper, use the following procedure:
	
	1. Open Control Panel and choose the Desktop icon. Select the desired wallpaper
	  to be saved as a bitmap, select the Tile option button, and then choose OK.
	
	2. Close all open applications in Windows. Press CTRL+ESC to display the Task
	  List. (Only Program Manager should appear.)
	
	3. Make sure Program Manager is in a window--it must not be maximized, and then
	  choose Move from the Control menu (ALT+SPACEBAR, M). Your mouse pointer
	  should now appear as a four-headed arrow. As you press the DOWN ARROW key, a
	  box outline the size of the Program Manager window moves down the screen.
	
	  When the top of the box outline is completely off the screen, press the ENTER
	  key. Program Manager then takes the place of the box outline completely off
	  the bottom of the screen, and only the tiled wallpaper remains visible on
	  your screen.
	
	  NOTE: You may move Program Manager in any direction, provided it is off the
	  screen.
	
	4. Capture the wallpaper image to the Clipboard by pressing Print Screen or the
	  ALT+PRINT SCREEN combination on your keyboard.
	
	5. Restore Program Manager to the screen by pressing ALT+SPACEBAR to display the
	  Control menu. Choose Move and press the UP ARROW key to move the box outline
	  to the center of the screen, and then press ENTER. Program Manager returns to
	  the screen.
	
	6. In the Accessories group, open and maximize Paintbrush. From the Options
	  menu, choose Image Attributes. Select Default and choose OK. From the View
	  menu, choose Zoom Out. Then choose Paste from the Edit menu to paste the
	  image grid. Choose Paste again to paste the actual image.
	
	7. From the View menu, choose Zoom In. Choose Save from the File menu and type a
	  filename for your bitmap. The tiled wallpaper is now saved as a bitmap.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTE: If at any time you are unable to return the Program Manager to
	your screen, press CTRL+ESC and then select Tile. This centers Program Manager
	on your screen.
