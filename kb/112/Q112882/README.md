	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When addressing a message with the Mail Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
	for Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, it is not possible to add an address
	to a message that does NOT appear in the All or Global Address List. Mail for
	AppleTalk MAPI does not have support for creating a gateway address within the
	MAPI application and then adding that address as a recipient of the mail
	message.
	
	Mail for AppleTalk MAPI is also known as the Microsoft Mail Software Development
	Kit (SDK) for Macintosh Programmers Workshop (MPW) C.
