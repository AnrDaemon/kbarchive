	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1d, 3.0, 3.0a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) has a documented switch for a
	monochrome display. The Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide" references the
	-SMONO switch. The online help references an -SM switch. Either switch is
	correct and produces identical results.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The External Mail program only looks for the first letter after the "-S" switch;
	all other letters after that are ignored. For example, -SMaverick has the same
	results as -SMono or -SM.
	
	NOTE: Microsoft is aware of the discrepancy between the manual and the online
	help. Both switch options are supported and are correct.
