	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Operator and Monitor terminate-and-stay resident programs (TSRs) that are
	used with the MS-DOS client are only capable of using the postoffice address
	list (POL) or the user's personal address list (PAL). The global address list
	(GAL), Postoffice Network List, and Microsoft Mail gateway address lists are not
	available for use in these two TSRs.
	
	You can use the CTRL+PAGE UP and CTRL+PAGE DOWN keystrokes to toggle between the
	two usable address lists.
