	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you export a Mail folder and choose the Move option, all the messages in
	the folder are moved. However, the empty folder is not deleted from the source
	message file.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by design. The folder hierarchy is kept intact to make it easier to move
	the messages back, if such an action is necessary.
