	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
	- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0 and later can create two
	different types of OLE objects: Slide objects and Presentation objects.
	
	If you link an object of one type into an OLE container, you cannot use the
	Convert command to convert the object type from one to the other.
	
	If the object is simply embedded, instead of linked, then you can convert between
	the two different object types.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
	beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
