	Article: Q44207
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 5.00 5.10 | 5.10
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS | OS/2
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | S_QuickC docerr | mspl13_c

	There is an error in the sample program given on Page 295 of the
	"Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler Run-Time Library Reference" for the
	freopen() function. The first fprintf() function call should be
	changed to a printf().
	
	This error is also present in the QuickC Versions 1.00, 1.01, and 2.00
	run-time library reference manuals. The sample program has been
	changed in the QuickC 2.00 on-line help example and is correct there.
