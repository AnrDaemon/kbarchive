	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	To use the numeric keypad with Microsoft Windows applications, the NUM LOCK
	key must be activated. For example, to use the numeric keypad for
	calculations with the Windows Calculator or to enter values in a Microsoft
	Excel version 2.0 worksheet, the NUM LOCK key must be activated.
	
	This condition is true for MS-DOS applications in general. The NUM LOCK
	(abbreviation for Numeric Lock) key toggles the  function of the keys in
	the calculator-style numeric keypad at the right side of the keyboard
	between cursor movement and numbers.
	
	For example, when the NUM LOCK key is activated (on most keyboards a NUM
	LOCK light indicates that the NUM LOCK key is activated), pressing the 4
	key types a "4" into an application; without the NUM LOCK key activated,
	pressing the 4 key is the same as pressing the LEFT ARROW key on the
	keyboard.
