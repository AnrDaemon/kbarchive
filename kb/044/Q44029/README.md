	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	PC AppleShare is a package of AppleTalk network utility programs for the PC from
	Apple, Inc. It allows you to share resources, such as hard-disk drives and
	printers that are connected to AppleTalk with a LocalTalk PC netcard. The DA.EXE
	utility emulates the Macintosh Chooser and allows you to select a LaserWriter,
	ImageWriter, or other AppleShare device made available to the network for your
	own use.
	
	If you attempt to run DA.EXE from the DOS prompt while the PC Mail Notifier is
	loaded, you will receive a partial list of AppleShare devices from the Chooser
	menu. You must turn off the Notifier to view all the AppleShare devices.
	
	Note: PC AppleShare was not one of the software configurations tested with
	Microsoft Mail (PC Client) version 1.37.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This configuration was tested with Mail (PC Client) versions 2.00 and 3.00.
	Running DA.EXE after Mail's Notifier is loaded will show a full list of
	AppleShare devices from the Chooser.
