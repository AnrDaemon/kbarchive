## Q44712: Mac Wkst: Identifying Which Users Are Logged On Local Server

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	To verify which users are currently signed in to Microsoft Mail, you must use
	the Address Mail window. To check which users are signed in, click the Address
	icon in any of the Send windows, then click the Local icon. Those users
	currently signed in have the word "connected" enclosed in parentheses next to
	their names. In versions of Mail earlier than version 2.0, users who were signed
	in had small Macintosh computer icons next to their names.
	
	This feature applies only to users with accounts on the server you are signed on
	to, and only when the Local icon has been selected. Mail cannot check whether
	users on other servers are signed in and cannot check for signed-in users on
	your server if the All icon is selected.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to the above method, a Network Manager can check any logged-in users
	if the Microsoft Mail Server is running as an application. Running the Mail
	server in this fashion will display an "AppleShare 2.0" type of window that
	displays users who are currently logged in to the server. However, the upkeep of
	this window is considered low priority for the server and, therefore, the
	information shown in the window may be slightly out of date.
