	========
	
	The first time you play a single-player game of Motocross Madness in the Stunt
	Quarry, the frame rate (the speed at which images are drawn on the screen,

	accelerator card is installed in your computer.
	
	
	STATUS

	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Motocross Madness,
	version 1.0.
