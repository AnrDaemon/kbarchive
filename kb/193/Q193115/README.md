	SYMPTOMS

	When you attempt to insert a Microsoft Clip Gallery 3.0 object in any Microsoft
	Office 97 program, it takes approximately twenty to thirty seconds before
	ClipGallery appears on your screen.

	(SR-2) patch if you previously installed Microsoft Office from the Microsoft

	occur if you installed the Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1) patch
	before installing the SR-2 patch.
	
	STATUS

	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
