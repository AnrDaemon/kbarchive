	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using a COM component from Visual Basic, you may not receive a compile-
	time error if you accidentally misspell a property or method name. Instead,
	Visual Basic will generate the following error at run-time:
	
	  Run-time error '438':
	  Object does not support this property or method.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This situation occurs when the object being referenced supports a dual or
	dispinterface, and therefore can be late-bound. If the component designer did
	not mark the interface as being "nonextensible," then Visual Basic cannot
	determine if the misspelled method/property name is misspelled, or if it is a
	new method or property added to the interface at a later time. Consequently,
	Visual Basic does not raise an error at compile-time, but rather checks at
	run-time whether the component supports a method/property by that name. The
	run-time error occurs if the object does not have the named method/property.
	
	The COM component creator can indicate whether or not an interface can be
	extended at a later time. If the interface is marked as "nonextensible," then
	Visual Basic will know at compile-time whether the object supports the named
	method/property.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you use Visual C++ to write your COM components, the default IDL files
	generated by the IDE do not contain the "nonextensible" keyword. COM components
	created in Visual Basic always contain this keyword.
	
	If you are building a COM component in Visual C++, and would like to make your
	dual or dispinterfaces nonextensible, simply add the "nonextensible" keyword to
	the interface attributes. For example:
	
	      importlib("StdOle2.tlb");
	
	      [
	        odl,
	        uuid(ACF8C871-1A73-11D2-AC0A-00600832A1F6),
	        version(1.0),
	        dual,
	        nonextensible,     // This is the line you need to add
	        oleautomation
	      ]
	      interface IMyInterface : IDispatch {
	          [id(0x68030000), propget]
	          HRESULT __stdcall Name([out, retval] long* );
	          [id(0x68030000), propput]
	          HRESULT __stdcall Name([in] long );
	          [id(0x60030001)]
	          HRESULT __stdcall PopMsg();
	      };
