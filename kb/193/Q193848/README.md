	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft has made available an add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint that clones the
	active presentation. This cloning process is similar to inserting slides from a
	file or using a copy and paste operation in Slide Sorter view. You can use this
	add-in to create a corruption-free copy of a presentation that you suspect may
	be corrupted.
	
	The Microsoft PowerPoint Presentation Cloning add-in is available as a
	self-extracting archive in the Microsoft Download Center. To install this
	add-in, download the Cloneme.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center and
	then double-click the Cloneme.exe file to start the Setup program.
	
	The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
