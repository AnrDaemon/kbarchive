	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you reinstall Windows 95 on a computer participating on a LANtastic 7.0
	network with modem sharing enabled, modem sharing may no longer work. Also,
	Device Manager may display an exclamation point in a yellow circle next to all
	virtual COM ports.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this behavior, remove and then reinstall the LANtastic 7.0 network
	client. For information about how to do so, refer to the documentation included
	with LANtastic 7.0 or contact Artisoft Technical Support.
	
	NOTE: Do not use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to uninstall
	LANTastic 7.0. Doing so results in the loss of all customized settings (for
	example, user databases).
