	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Service Pack 3 and earlier, if the media access control address of a network
	interface card (NIC) is changed dynamically (for example, through kernel mode
	drivers), the TCP/IP protocol will not automatically respond to the change.
	
	In Service Pack 4, a new status indication was added so that TCP/IP may respond
	appropriately to the change.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
	please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
	NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
	Service Pack 4.
