{% raw %}

	Article: Q193762
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): 5.5,5.5 SP1
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): exc55sp2fix

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Using the following diagram to aid explanation:
	
	  MS Mail ------> Exchange Server A <-----------------> Exchange Server B
	                                   '88 X400 - NO D/REP
	
	When messages with zero byte files are sent from Microsoft Mail to Exchange
	Server B, Exchange Server B sends non-delivery reports on the messages.
	
	Typical events seen in the event logs (generated by the message transfer agent or
	MTA) include:
	
	 Event: 210
	  Description: An internal MTA error occurred. Content conversion for
	  message C=US;A= ;P=Microsoft;L=SERVERB-980805135302Z-7 failed.
	  Conversion error: 4096, Object at fault: 0600002F, Original content
	  type: 2A864886F7140501, New content type: 56010A01. PDU dump reference
	  1 [MTA DISP:FANOUT 13 112] (14)
	
	 Event: 290
	  Description: A non-delivery report (reason code unable-to-transfer and
	  diagnostic code content-syntax-error) is being generated for message
	  C=US;A= ;P=Microsoft;L=SERVERB-980805135302Z-7. It was originally
	  destined for DN:/o=MICROSOFT/ou=SHELLKEEP/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=MSMailA<A7>
	  (recipient number 1), and was to be redirected to
	  DN:/o=MICROSOFT/ou=SHELLKEEP/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=MSMailA<A7>C=US;A=
	  ;P=Microsoft;O=ShellMSMI;S=Admin;G=MSMail;. [MTA DISP:RESULT 18 136]
	  (12)
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by a boundary condition bug in the MTA.
