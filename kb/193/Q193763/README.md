## Q193763: GetFileAttributes API May Return Invalid Return Code

	Article: Q193763
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT400sp5fix
	Last Modified: 16-MAY-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The return value expected, when using GetFileAttributes, is FFFFFFFF for
	failure, and for success the value of the files attributes. Sometimes, when the
	API should have been returning failure, it was succeeding and returning invalid
	attributes.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Some file information is cached locally when it is opened. So, when another
	process needed some of that information and it was cached, it was obtained
	without checking to see if it had the proper rights to obtain that information.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
