	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	By default, the bulletin board (BBS) window shows you only the messages that
	have accumulated since the most recently read message. The Microsoft Network
	also maintains the entire thread that leads to any unread messages. So, if a
	message has a parent, you also see the parent, whether you have read it or not.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	If you skip messages and do not read them, they do not automatically show up the
	next time you enter the bulletin board. If there is a message you want to see
	later, you need to make sure that it and every message after it is marked as
	unread. To do so, select the appropriate messages and then click Mark Message As
	Unread on the Tools menu.
	
	You can also show all the messages on the bulletin board by clicking Show All
	Messages on the Tools menu. However, be aware that messages do expire after a
	specified time set by the Forum Manager and then are no longer available on the
	bulletin board.
	
	Information regarding read and unread messages is stored on your local computer.
	If you read messages from one computer, then sign on to The Microsoft Network
	from another computer, the messages you read from the first computer are marked
	as unread.
