## Q129293: Writer/Artist: The Switcher Tool

	Article: Q129293
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Kids Products

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The CD-ROM versions of Fine Artist and Creative Writer (versions 1.1 and 1.1a)
	include a tool called the Switcher (the colorful spiral disk located to the left
	of the Exit Door when you're working in the Studio, and also on the wall on any
	of the floors).
	
	The purpose of the Switcher is to allow you to easily switch between Creative
	Writer and Fine Artist. For the Switcher to work, you must have both Creative
	Writer and Fine Artist versions 1.1 on CD-ROM. If you do not have both
	applications on CD-ROM, the Switcher Box cannot switch to the other program.
	
	The floppy disk versions of Creative Writer and Fine Artist (version 1.0) do not
	include a Switcher icon and therefore do not have Switching capability.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Getting Started guide implies that all Microsoft Kids products should appear
	in the Switcher Box, which is not quite accurate. Only Creative Writer and Fine
	Artist versions 1.1 and 1.1a on CD-ROM appear in the Switcher box.
	
	You can simulate the Switcher if you do not have both Creative Writer and Fine
	Artist on CD-ROM, by following the directions in the "Creative Writer/Fine
	Artist Getting Started" guide.
	
	Page 13 of the "Creative Writer/Fine Artist Getting Started" guide for Windows
	states:
	
	  Hold down CTRL+ESC to display the Windows Task List or ALT+TAB to cycle
	  through the programs you have open. (If Fine Artist or Creative Writer is not
	  already running, use CTRL+ESC or ALT+TAB to go to Program Manager and then
	  start the program.)
	
	Page 10 of the "Creative Writer/Fine Artist Getting Started" guide for the
	Macintosh states:
	
	  Hold down COMMAND+SHIFT+A. Click OK. Double-click the program you want to
	  start.
