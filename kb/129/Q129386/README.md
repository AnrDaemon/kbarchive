	How Does the Internet Assistant Add-in Alter PowerPoint 95?
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Internet Assistant add-in adds the Export As HTML command to the File menu in
	PowerPoint. You can create an HTML version of your presentation by clicking this
	command, typing a name for your project, and then clicking OK.
	
	What Does Internet Assistant for PowerPoint 95 Do?
	--------------------------------------------------
	
	When you click the Export As HTML command, two HTML versions of each slide are
	created: one graphic version and one text version. The text version is useful
	for Web browsers that can't view graphics -- in addition, a text version of a
	slide is easier for a reader to "flip through" than a graphic version of a
	slide. The graphic version of the slide retains the color scheme and appearance
	of your original presentation.
	
	Because the Internet Assistant add-in creates "client side image maps" of your
	original slides, both versions of the slides maintain the PowerPoint interactive
	settings that jump to other slides or documents. For example, if clicking an
	oval on slide 1 takes you directly to slide 5 in the original presentation, that
	functionality is retained in the HTML version of the slide.
