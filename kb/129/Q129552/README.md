	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet that contains rotated text to a Compaq
	PageMarq 20 printer, the text is rotated at an incorrect angle if the graphics
	resolution is set to 800 x 400.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Lotus 1-2-3 is unable to print rotated text accurately to a Compaq Page- Marq 20
	printer using an asymmetrical graphics resolution. This behavior is specific to
	Lotus 1-2-3 and is not caused by a problem in Windows 95.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, change the graphics resolution to a symmetrical
	resolution such as 300 x 300.
