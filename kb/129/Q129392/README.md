	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print multiple copies of a document in WordPad, the Collate option is
	unavailable.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Collate feature is not a WordPad feature, but is provided by the printer
	driver. If the Collate option is unavailable, the installed printer driver does
	not support the Collate feature.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Contact the manufacturer of the printer to inquire about an updated printer
	driver that supports this feature.
