## Q129133: XCLN: Can't Switch from Message Back to Address Book

	Article: Q129133
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
	Operating System(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you compose a new message, you cannot select a name from the address book,
	choose the Compose New Message button, and then move back to the address book to
	select more names.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This operation is by design. The dialog box is modal in nature; therefore, it
	requires completion of the action--in this case, selection of the Send
	button--before any other operation can be taken.
