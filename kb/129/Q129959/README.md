	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to select a biography for a player that doesn't have one, you
	receive the following message:
	
	  A biography for the selected player is not available.
	
	  Complete Baseball contains biographies for major players and personalities in
	  Baseball. To view these biographies, click OK. To return to the selected
	  player's statistics, click Cancel.
	
	If you click OK you return to the default Hank Aaron screen, and the Choose
	Player and Show Players With default biographies selection.
	
	Cancel returns you to the Tommie Aaron statistics screen, rather than the
	selected player's statistics.
