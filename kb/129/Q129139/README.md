	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer was designed to be run from a local
	installation of Windows. Although it is possible to run the Windows client off
	the network, the Forms Designer must be run from a local copy of Windows. Forms
	created using the Forms Designer, however, can be run correctly from a shared
	network installation of Windows.
