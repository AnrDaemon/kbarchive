	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you type in a new value for the font size on the Microsoft Exchange
	toolbar, the size in the toolbar reverts to its previous setting and the
	selected text does not change in size.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	You must press the ENTER key after you have made the change. If you do not press
	the ENTER key, the size reverts to its previous setting.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
	4.0 Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT clients. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
	becomes available.
