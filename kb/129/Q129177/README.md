	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft 500 Nations Picture Gallery allows you to select images for use as
	Windows wallpaper. At times, this wallpaper may looked washed out or discolored.
	However, clicking the wallpaper or desktop redraws the image and normalizes the
	colors.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	You may find applications can require their own set of 256 colors when you use a
	256 color video driver. However, with such a driver, Windows can only supply one
	set of colors on the screen at a time. Therefore, when two on- screen images,
	such as wallpaper and 500 Nations, make separate color requests, you may see
	washed-out colors because Windows applies the same set of 256 colors to each
	application.
