	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you either display or print a Team Season Schedule, the calendar day of the
	week goes from Sunday to Saturday.
	
	As a general rule, professional baseball calendars start with Monday and go
	through Sunday.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Baseball calendars begin on Monday and end on Sunday because teams are scheduled
	to play in a city either 2, 3, or 4 days in a row.
	
	Professional baseball takes advantage of the Monday through Sunday schedule so
	one team can play another team in what is called a weekend series. The weekend
	series is a set of games always scheduled on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and is
	always played against the same team.
	
	The Sunday game is usually a day game, so teams can travel to the next city on
	the same day, if necessary. If possible, Monday is scheduled as a day off and is
	considered an off day where no game is scheduled.
