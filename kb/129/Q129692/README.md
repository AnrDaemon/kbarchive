	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The behavior is by design. Scores are not recorded until the game ends.
	
	To see how your scores compare with other players click Best Players. If scores
	have not been cleared, the best scores appear.
	
	Scores for current games are not recorded in the Best Players list until you
	click End Quiz. Scores are then recorded only if the number of hits is higher
	than those recorded in the Best Players list.
