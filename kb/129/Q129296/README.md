	The Microsoft Network remembers the column widths for each individual folder.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you select Details view for a folder, a header bar appears with these
	columns: Name, Type, Size, and Modified. You can change the width of the columns
	by dragging the vertical bars located between the column names.
	
	When you go into another folder, the column width changes you made in the
	previous folder are not used. However, when you return to the previous folder,
	the changes you made are present. The Microsoft Network applies column width
	changes only to the folder in which you make the changes.
