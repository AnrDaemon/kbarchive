	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you change routing information for an external postoffice with Microsoft
	Mail for PC Networks Administration program (ADMIN.EXE) version 3.2.13 and
	earlier, ADMIN.EXE does not report a failure to update the .XTN file if the .XTN
	file is locked open by another process, such as EXTERNAL.EXE.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions earlier than 3.2.13 of
	ADMIN.EXE. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
