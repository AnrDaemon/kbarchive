	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to install Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows NT from floppy
	disks onto a computer running Windows 95, you receive the following error
	message:
	
	  This Setup is not intended for this version of Windows.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Setup program for Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT checks the version of
	the operating system before installing Microsoft Excel. The list of supported
	operating systems on the floppy-disk version is missing the entry for Windows
	95.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for
	Windows NT. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
