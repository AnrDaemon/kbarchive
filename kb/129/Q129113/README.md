	Event 4206 is a stop message that indicates a serious error occurred when
	a push thread was requested by a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
	server. This message can appear in the server system log when the WINS
	databases are valid. They should continue to function properly.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
	We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
	the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. This problem was
	corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
