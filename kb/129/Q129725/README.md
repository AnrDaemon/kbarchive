	================
	
	The Microsoft Knowledge Base is a primary Microsoft product information source
	that Microsoft support professionals use to help customers. This source is also
	available to Microsoft customers. This comprehensive database includes more than
	250,000 detailed articles containing technical information about Microsoft
	products, fix lists, documentation errors, and answers to commonly asked
	technical support questions. These articles are also available through the
	Microsoft TechNet CD and the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) CD.
	
	Connecting to the Microsoft World Wide Web site requires a "live" session to the
	Internet through an Internet service provider.
