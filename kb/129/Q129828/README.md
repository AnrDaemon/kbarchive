	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The MODEL structure defines the highest level interface for a VBX or OLE
	Control. In Visual Basic version 3.0, you could modify this structure to provide
	sub-classing or other specialized functionality. In Visual Basic version 4.0,
	you are not allowed to change the MODEL structure of built-in controls. This is
	enforced in Visual Basic version 4.0 by making the MODEL structure read-only.
