	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
	include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
	"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
	address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
	contains specific information for working around problems.
	
	Disk 3 Doesn't Work with Windows
	--------------------------------
	
	Three floppy disks are included with "Microsoft Word 6 Resource Kit," second
	edition. Although disks 1 and 2 install correctly on your Windows- based
	computer, disk 3 is for the Macintosh and cannot be recognized as a formatted
	disk by a Windows-based system.
	
	Correction:
	
	The disk labels for all three floppy disks should be changed as follows:
	
	- Disk 1: Change "Disk 1 of 3" to "Disk 1 for the PC"
	
	- Disk 2: Change "Disk 2 of 3" to "Disk 2 for the PC"
	
	- Disk 3: Change "Disk 3 of 3" to "Disk 1 for the Mac"
	
	Comments:
	
	Only the first two disks are formatted for Windows. The third disk is only for
	Macintosh computers, and you should not attempt to install it on a Windows-based
	machine.
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
