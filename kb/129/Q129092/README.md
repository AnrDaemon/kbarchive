	The status bar at the bottom of a bulletin board (BBS) window shows the
	number of conversations and the number of conversations with unread
	messages. For example,
	
	  
	
	  5 conversations, 1 with unread messages
	
	If the bulletin board contains a subfolder, The Microsoft Network counts
	the subfolder as a conversation and as an unread message.
