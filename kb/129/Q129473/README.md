	applications that do not support palette control.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Pictures copied from Picture Gallery need to be pasted into an application that
	understands color palettes (such as Microsoft Word for Windows or Windows 95
	Paint). To use the Picture Gallery, choose the Options menu in 500 Nations.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The following text is included in the 500 Nations README.TXT under the section
	titled printing and copying:
	
	  If you copy a picture from 500 Nations, and paste it into another Windows
	  application, you may encounter palette problems (the picture will have
	  incorrect colors). This is because some Windows applications (like Write and
	  Paintbrush) don't support full color palette control. For example, you can
	  get a correct color image by pasting into an application that supports color
	  control such as Paint in Windows 95, or Microsoft Word for Windows.
