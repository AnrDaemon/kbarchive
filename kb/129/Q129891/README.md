	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run ScanDisk, you may receive the following error message
	
	  The <drive> folder contains incorrect information about the
	  <name> file.
	
	where <drive> is the hard disk's drive letter and <name> is the hard
	disk's volume label.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	ScanDisk checks for and corrects invalid characters in the hard disk's volume
	label, but incorrectly reports such errors as problems with a file.
	
	Note that there is no danger in permitting ScanDisk to correct the invalid
	characters.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
