	SYMPTOMS
	========

	viewing of the complete article, the audio ceases if you scroll far enough right
	to move the audio controller out of the window.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows,
	1993 edition. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows,
	1994 and 1995 editions.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========

	window. Resizing the window brings the entire article into view, making the
	scroll bar unnecessary. This method only works if the current window is not full
