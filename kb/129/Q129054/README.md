## Q129054: Periods Not Displayed in CD-ROM Disc Volume Label

	Article: Q129054
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): 
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s):

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If a CD-ROM disc has a period in the volume label, Windows NT 3.5 does not show
	the period. This affects applications that query the volume label to ensure the
	correct disc is in the CD-ROM drive. This only affects down-level clients, not
	other Windows NT Servers or Workstations.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To workaround this problem, share the CD-ROM from a Windows for Workgroups
	version 3.11 computer.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
	problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
	version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
