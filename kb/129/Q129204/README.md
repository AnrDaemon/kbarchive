	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51, the Books Online (NTBOOKS.EXE)
	program item is not present in the Main group of Program Manager. The program
	item is available when you perform a new installation of Windows NT version
	3.51.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Books Online program item allows you to point to the location of the Windows
	NT Books Online and automatically open the books when you choose the program
	item. You can also run Book Online from the MS-DOS Command Prompt by typing the
	following:
	
	  ntbooks.exe /n
	
	Changing the location of Books Online is useful if books are being read from a
	CD-ROM drive, and then copied to a server.
	
	NOTE: If you previously installed Windows NT version 3.5 Online Books, remove the
	old books and their associated icon before using the Windows NT version 3.51
	Books Online.
