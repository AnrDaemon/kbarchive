	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click New or Open on the Microsoft Fax properties Message tab, nothing
	happens.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur because the Fax Cover Page Editor is already open. When
	you click New or Open, you open the Fax Cover Page Editor. If you click New or
	Open again before you close the Fax Cover Page Editor, nothing happens.
	
	The Fax Cover Page Editor is designed to run only one instance of itself at a
	time.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:
	
	- Close the Fax Cover Page Editor before you click New or Open again.
	
	- To start another instance of the Fax Cover Page Editor, start the next
	  instance from the Start menu. To do so, click the Start button, point to
	  Programs, point to Accessories, point to Fax, and then click Cover Page
	  Editor.
