	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may receive a
	message with an attachment; however, the attachment will not have an extension
	on the name. If a file does not have an extension, you can not double-click it
	to open and read it.
	
	You can open a file without an extension into the NOTEPAD.EXE application by
	pressing the ALT key and double-clicking the attachment icon.
	
	NOTE: Notepad will be launched in the background. As a result, you will have to
	switch to Notepad to see the attached document. However, if the file is not
	ASCII text, it may not be readable.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Windows applications have a feature called File Association that will launch a
	specific application when you double-click an attachment. However, this feature
	will not help you open a file without an extension.
	
	For additional information, please see the File Associations topic in your
	Microsoft Windows documentation.
