	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	A single Tandy joystick plugged into a built-in game port of a Tandy 1000 SL
	computer reportedly does not work correctly with Flight Simulator version 4.00.
	If a second Tandy joystick is plugged into the other built-in game port, both
	joysticks will function correctly.
	
	This problem has also been reported with the Tandy 1000 TX. It has also been
	reported that plugging a second joystick in will also correct the problem.
	
	Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
	becomes available.
