	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Leading Edge D3 using Leading Edge DOS Version 3.30 does not permit the
	entry of "Mode CO80" at the command line to allow Microsoft Windows to run with
	a monochrome VGA display.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	This computer is supplied with software from Leading Edge to reconfigure the
	graphics adapter to run as a color VGA. The software is supplied on the
	Utilities Disk. After reconfiguration, the display is still in monochrome and
	Windows works properly.
