	Question:
	
	Can I access any memory beyond the base 640K on my machine within DOS?
	
	Response:
	
	If you have expanded memory and you have an EMS (Expanded Memory
	Specification) driver that conforms to LIM (Lotus/Intel/Microsoft)
	specifications, you can access memory beyond the base 640K available
	on your machine. For information about accessing this memory, contact
	Intel at (800) 538-3373 or (503) 629-7362.
	
	Intel will send you EMS specifications and documentation discussing
	writing code that uses EMS specifications, including a reprint of the
	March 1987 Microsoft Systems Journal article, "Expanded Memory:
	Writing Programs That Break the 640K Barrier."
