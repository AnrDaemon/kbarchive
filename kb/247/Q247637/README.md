	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	MIP Mapping is a 3D rendering method used in many games, including Flight
	Simulator 2000. When textured scenery in a game disappears into the distance,
	MIP-mapping mixes high-detail and low-detail versions of the same texture to
	make distant textures appear more natural.
