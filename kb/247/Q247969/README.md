	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.1, 2.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You may experience intermittent problems with Windows 95 OEM Service Release
	(OSR) 2.1 or OSR 2.5 when you are using external Universal Serial Bus (USB)
	hubs. These problems may include:
	
	- The computer stops responding (hangs) while it is entering Suspended mode.
	
	- The computer hangs while it is resuming.
	
	- The computer may experience problems during shutdown.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Windows 95 OSR 2.1 and OSR 2.5 provides basic USB support that was developed as
	the technology was first emerging. Based on today's more mature USB technology,
	there are a number of limitations with USB support in Windows 95 OSR 2.1 and
	Windows 95 OSR 2.5.
	
	These limitations were addressed in Microsoft Windows 98 and carried forward to
	Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition. Addressing these limitations required
	several architectural changes that are not portable back to Windows 95 OSR 2.1
	or Windows 95 OSR 2.5.
	
	Microsoft recommends that customers who require a more robust USB environment
	upgrade to Windows 98 or Windows 98 Second Edition.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article.
