	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you press a button on a Microsoft SideWinder game controller while you are
	playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, an unexpected action may occur.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you press a button combination that includes the
	Shift button on the game controller. By default, you cannot use the Shift button
	on a SideWinder game controller to modify the action assigned to another game
	controller button in Flight Simulator 2000.
	
	The Shift button functions only as a single button, unless you reconfigure the
	SideWinder game controller in the SideWinder Profile Editor.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, configure your SideWinder game controller in the
	SideWinder Profile Editor to use the Shift button as a modifier button in button
	combinations:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Hardware, point to Game
	  Controllers, and then click SideWinder Profile Editor.
	
	2. Click the SideWinder game controller for which you want to create the
	  profile, and then click OK.
	
	3. On the Recorder tab, under Name, click the button to which you want to assign
	  an action in the game.
	
	4. Type a name for the action you want to assign.
	
	5. Under Programmable Action, click the box to the right of the button you just
	  named.
	
	6. Click the Keystrokes tab, and then press the key or key combination you want
	  to assign to this button.
	
	7. Click OK.
	
	8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 to assign any other keys or key combinations to this
	  profile.
	
	9. On the File menu, click Save As.
	
	10. In the "Save as type" box, click to select your SideWinder game controller.
	
	11. In the "File name" box, type a name for the profile, and then click Save.
