	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you fly in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, you do not land automatically
	when you press the X key.
	
	In addition, when you configure your controls in Flight Simulator 2000, the Land
	Me command is not in the list of commands that you can assign to a control.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design. The Land Me command in Microsoft Flight Simulator 98
	no longer exists in Flight Simulator 2000.
