	- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to reply to a message on a shared mailbox to which you have
	been given Reviewer permissions, but not "Send on Behalf of" permissions, a
	reply form opens with the From field pre-populated. When you click the Send
	button, you receive the following error message:
	
	  You do not have the permission to send the message on behalf of the specified
	  user.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior is by design.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	There are two workarounds for this problem:
	
	- Request your Exchange Server administrator to give you "Send On Behalf Of"
	  permissions on the shared mailbox.
	
	- When the reply form opens, delete name or names in the pre-populated From
	  field, and then click Send.
