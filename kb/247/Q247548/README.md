	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Page 69: 1900 Is Not A Leap Year
	--------------------------------
	
	On Page 69, in the first paragraph, the last sentence states that 1900 was a leap
	year, so it had 366 days. This information is incorrect. This sentence should be
	deleted.
	
	In addition, it should be noted that the year 1900 is not a leap year as the
	illustration at the top of the page indicates by the number 366. It should also
	be noted that Microsoft Excel treats 1900 as a leap year, and that this
	algorithm was adopted to maintain compatibility with dates in Lotus 1-2-3, and
	is by design.
