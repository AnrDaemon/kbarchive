## Q247176: XCLN: Sent Time Info Incorrect for Delayed Delivery Messages

	Article: Q247176
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): WINDOWS:2000,97,98
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 22-JUN-2001
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
	- Microsoft Outlook 97 
	- Microsoft Outlook 98 
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use Outlook 97, Outlook 98, or Outlook 2000 to send a delayed message,
	the actual "Sent Time" time stamp information for that message is the compose
	time of the message and not the actual sent time. This is by design.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Outlook 97, Outlook 98, and Outlook 2000 all have a facility to create a message
	and delay its delivery by a specific period of time. This delay period can range
	from 1 minute to several weeks. When the message is eventually delivered, the
	recipient still sees the time at which the message was composed by the client,
	and not the time the message actually left the Outbox.
