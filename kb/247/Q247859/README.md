	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes the Real-World Weather feature in Microsoft Flight
	Simulator.
	
	NOTE: To use the Real-World Weather feature in Flight Simulator, you must connect
	to the Internet.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Real-World Weather feature in Flight Simulator downloads a snapshot of
	current weather data for the entire world, and uses this snapshot to configure
	the weather conditions in Flight Simulator automatically.
	
	To use the Real-World Weather feature in Flight Simulator:
	
	1. Connect to the Internet, and then start Flight Simulator.
	
	2. On the World menu, click Weather.
	
	3. Click "Real-world weather" to download current weather data.
	
	4. When the download is finished, click the green CHECK MARK.
	
	When you download weather data from the Web, Flight Simulator uses the data to
	configure local weather conditions in the game. Weather conditions in Flight
	Simulator remain unchanged until you use the Real-World Weather feature to
	request an update. The weather data on the source Web site is updated hourly.
	
	Flight Simulator attempts to interpolate weather data between adjacent weather
	stations to create smooth weather transitions. However, weather transitions
	between stations can sometimes be abrupt. If conditions at adjacent weather
	stations differ significantly, you may notice an abrupt weather transition. In
	most cases, Flight Simulator 2000 is able to make smooth weather transitions
	between stations.
