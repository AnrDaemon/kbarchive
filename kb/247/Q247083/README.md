	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Importers for Lotus cc:Mail Archives and Notes Mail move messages
	from existing cc:Mail archive files and Notes mail databases to Microsoft
	Exchange server, allowing users to preserve business-critical information. These
	importers help automate the migration process from cc:Mail and Notes to Exchange
	server, making it less time and resource intensive for IT and users. As part of
	the migration process the importers also resolve the addresses of authors as
	they convert messages, allowing users to "reply" and "reply-all" directly from
	Exchange.

	files included with MMail.exe.
