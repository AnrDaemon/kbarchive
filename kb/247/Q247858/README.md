	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Your computer may issue a 0x7F bug check upon receiving a FAT media Cyclic
	Redundancy Check (CRC) error message.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	When Fastfat.sys does not read data from the media because of a CRC error
	message, Fastfat.sys falls into infinite loop and the kernel stack soon
	overflows (stop 0x7F).
