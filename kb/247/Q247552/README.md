	---------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 54, in the last paragraph, make the following corrections in the first
	sentence.
	
	Change:
	"Both thinnet and thicknet cable use a connection component, known as a BNC
	connector, to make the connections between the cable and the computers."
	
	To:
	"Thinnet cable uses a connection component, known as a BNC connector, to make the
	connections between the cable and the computers."
	
	
	Page 59: Category 3 And Category 4 Transmission Rates Are Incorrect
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 59 the description of Category 3 and Category 4 lists an incorrect data
	transmission rate. Category 3 lists 16 Mbps and should read 10 Mbps. Category 4
	lists 20 Mbps and should read 16 Mbps.
	
	Change:
	"Category 3 This category certifies UTP cable for data transmission up to 16
	Mbps. It consists of...
	Category 4 This category certifies UTP cable for data transmission up to 20 Mbps.
	It consists of..."
	
	To:
	"Category 3 This category certifies UTP cable for data transmission up to 10
	Mbps. It consists of...
	Category 4 This category certifies UTP cable for data transmission up to 16 Mbps.
	It consists of..."
	
	
	Pages 72 & 101: BNC Connector Is Used Only With Thinnet
	-------------------------------------------------------
	
	On pages 72 and 101 in bullet number 5, change:
	"The BNC connector is used with both thinnet and thicknet cables."

	is running UNIX, and a third is running AppleTalk."
	
	To:
	"For example, in the network shown in Figure 4.6, a Windows NT server is
	supporting two clients: one computer is running Microsoft Windows 95, the other
