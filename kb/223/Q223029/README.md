	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), the Compaq Prosignia 500
	server may stop responding (hang) at the blue build screen.
	
	After you perform the Emergency Repair Disk procedure and reapply Windows NT 4.0
	Service Pack 3 (SP3), the server restarts normally. However, after you apply
	Service Pack 4 again, the server hangs at the blue build screen.
	
	CAUSE

	This issue occurs because the Compaq Prosignia 500 requires a firmware upgrade
	from Compaq before you install Windows NT 4.0 SP4.
