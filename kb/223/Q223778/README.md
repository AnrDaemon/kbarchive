	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), a Windows NT 4.0 RAS client
	may not be able to connect to a Windows NT 4.0 SP4 RAS server when the RAS
	client chooses Windows NT 3.1 as the dial-up server type. This problem occurs on
	all Far East versions of Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4, but not on other
	languages.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
	phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
