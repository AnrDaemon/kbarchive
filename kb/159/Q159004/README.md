	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to use the Hard Disk Drive Low Power mode feature in
	Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2).
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Hard Disk Drive Low Power mode in Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 is a
	power-saving feature that "spins down" an IDE hard disk after it is idle for a
	predetermined amount of time.
	
	To modify this setting, follow these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click Power.
	
	2. Click the Disk Drives tab.
	
	3. Modify the appropriate settings:
	
	   - To disable Hard Disk Drive Low Power mode when you are using AC power,
	     Click the "When powered by AC power" check box to clear it
	
	   - To disable Hard Disk Drive Low Power mode when you are using batteries,
	     click the "When powered by batteries" check box to clear it.
	
	   - You can also adjust the time the hard disk drive must remain idle before
	     it is placed in Low Power mode.
	
	Note that this feature is not available on computers that use SCSI hard disks and
	controllers as the primary disk and controller type and that do not contain any
	IDE controllers.
