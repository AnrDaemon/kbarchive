	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. How do I create numbered headings in Word 97 that are suitable for
	  technical or legal documents?
	
	  A. You can automatically add numbers to the headings in a technical or legal
	  document with the numbering format you choose by using the built-in heading
	  styles. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	  If you use the built-in heading styles to format headings in a document, you
	  can automatically number headings with the numbering format you choose.
	
	  a. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering, and then click the
	     Outline Numbered tab.
	
	  b. Click a number format that contains the text "Heading 1," "Heading 2," and
	     so on.
	
	  If you do not want to use built-in heading styles, you can still add numbers
	  to the headings by using the following steps to link each heading to a
	  numbered format:
	
	  a. Make sure that the headings in the document are formatted with custom
	     styles.
	
	  b. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering", and then click the
	     Outline Numbered tab.
	
	  c. Click a number format.
	
	  d. Click Customize.
	
	  e. In the Level box or the Preview box, click the heading level that you want
	     to number.
	
	     For example, if you want to number the top-level heading style which you've
	     named "My Style 1" in your document, click 1 in the Level box.
	
	  f. Click More.
	
	  g. In the "Link level to style" box, click the style that corresponds to the
	     level you selected in step e.
	
	     For example, if you clicked 1 in the Level box, click "My Style 1".
	
	  h. Repeat steps e through g for each heading style in the document.
	
	2. Q. How do I restart or interrupt the automatic numbering sequence in the
	  middle of a list?
	
	  A. You can restart the automatic numbering as follows:
	
	  a. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".
	
	  b. Under List Numbers, select the Restart Numbering option.
	
	  NOTE: You can also set the numbering sequence to start at a specific number by
	  clicking Customize and changing the Start At under Number Format to be a
	  specific number. Word will automatically continue the sequence from the
	  number you inserted.
	
	3. Q. How do I get Word to continue a numbered list that is interrupted by
	  non-numbered text?
	
	  A. You can get Word to continue a numbered list as follows:
	
	  a. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".
	
	  b. Click the numbering style that you used in the list that you want to
	     continue.
	
	  c. Under List Numbers, select the Continue Previous List option.
	
	4. Q. How do I make Word recognize and help me create a multi-level list that
	  mixes numbers and letters?
	
	  A. Word refers to multi-level lists as outline numbered lists and recognizes
	  seven pre-defined list formats. To apply one of the pre-defined formats, do
	  the following:
	
	  a. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".
	
	  b. Click the Outline Numbered tab.
	
	  c. Click the list format that you want to use, and then click OK.
	
	  To create a custom format, use the following steps:
	
	  a. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering, and then click the
	     Outline Numbered tab.
	
	  b. Click Customize.
	
	  c. Click the level that you want to modify in the Level box or the Preview
	     box, and then change the formats for that level.
	
	  Repeat steps a-c for each level you want to modify.
	
	5. Q. How do I number items in an outline level list or include more than one
	  numbering level on a single line?
	
	  A. In an outline numbered list, you can use the LISTNUM field to number items
	  or to include more than one numbering level on a single line.
	
	  For example, if the list item is "1. a)," you can use the LISTNUM field to
	  automatically insert "a)," "b)," and any subsequent items on the same
	  numbering level. To insert a LISTNUM field, do the following:
	
	  a. On the Insert menu, click Field.
	
	  b. In the Categories box, double-click Numbering.
	
	  c. In the "Field names" box, double-click ListNum.
	
	  d. Type the text for the list item, and then press ENTER.
	
	  e. To insert the next number at the same level, for example (ii), repeat
	     steps a through d.
	
	6. Q. How do I reapply Outline Numbering to a document after the numbering has
	  been removed?
	
	  A. When you apply Outline Numbering to a document, remove the numbering format
	  from all the paragraphs, and then reapply the format, Word reapplies Outline
	  Numbering only to the paragraph that contains the insertion point. To reset
	  paragraph formatting and reapply outline numbering, follow these steps in the
	  order in which they are presented.
	
	Reset Paragraph Formatting
	--------------------------
	
	  1. Select the paragraphs from which you removed the Outline Numbering format.
	
	  2. Press CTRL+Q.
	
	     NOTE: If you use List Styles, this step resets the paragraph formatting for
	     the selected paragraphs to the default formatting and reapplies the
	     Numbering format.
	
	Select the Paragraphs and Reapply Outline Numbering
	---------------------------------------------------
	
	  1. Select the paragraphs from which you removed the Outline Numbering format.
	
	  2. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".
	
	  3. Click the Outline Numbered tab, select an Outline Numbering format, and
	     then click OK.
