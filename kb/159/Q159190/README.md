## Q159190: XCON: Spaces in Attachment File Names Are Replaced with Tildes

	Article: Q159190
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 09-APR-1999
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	All versions of the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector (IMC)
	replace spaces in attachment file names with tildes (~).
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is by product design. Some clients could not handle attachments with a
	space in the name so the IMC converts the space to a tilde.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information when
	it becomes available.
