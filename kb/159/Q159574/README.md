	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The network connection may be blocked by a jammed hub. Some hubs come with a
	Collision LED, such as Antipodes. This LED will light constantly if the hub is
	jammed. Turning the hub off and then back on again generally brings the hub back
	to normal operation. If there is no Collision LED on the hub, you can still try
	turning the hub off and on again to see if it helps.
