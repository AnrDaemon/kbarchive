	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	There is no way to determine which team(s) a particular squad leader, platoon
	leader, or company commander can affect.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	On page eighteen of the reference manual, the third paragraph states:
	
	  "If an insignia is displayed, the team is commanded by a squad leader
	  (or higher). Squad leaders can affect the men on all the teams under
	  their command."
	
	The insignia or rank of a particular soldier is displayed in the soldier monitor.
	Although this provides a way to determine if a particular team is affected by a
	leader other than the team leader, there is no way to determine which leader
	affects which team(s).
