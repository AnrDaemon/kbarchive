	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	At the beginning of Level 10, Hastings command states that your Hydra has been
	equipped with an H2 66 warhead. However at the beginning of Level 11, the
	onboard computer states that you are releasing an HY 66 warhead.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The prototype Hydra fighter that your are piloting is incorrectly stating that
	it is deploying the lower yield HY 66 type of warhead. You are in fact,
	deploying an H2 66 warhead.
	
	This problem in warhead type recognition by the Hydra's onboard computer is a
	result of an inconsistency in its arsenal database. An error occurred during the
	arming of the H2 66 by the Hastings' Hydra crew.
	
	Additional query words: 1.00 warhead
