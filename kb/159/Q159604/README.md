	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Winfile.exe (file manager) from a computer running Windows 95 to
	view a Windows NT version 3.51 NTFS share, the files with long filenames are
	displayed as having zero bytes.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use Windows NT Explorer or upgrade your server
	computer to Windows NT 4.0. When you view files from a computer running Windows
	95 using Winfile.exe to a Windows NT version 4.0 NTFS share, this problem does
	not occur.
	
	
	STATUS
	======

	researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
