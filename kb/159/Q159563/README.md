	affects Microsoft Exchange Server.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Q: What is Citrix WinFrame Server?
	
	A: WinFrame is a multi-user Windows application server based on Windows NT Server
	3.51. It supports enterprise application deployment using a thin client
	architecture. Citrix WinFrame technology allows the clients to run processes on
	a remote server while only passing keystrokes, mouse movement, and video over a
	connection, usually ISDN or dial-up. This greatly reduces overhead for the
	client and allows older, slower systems much greater performance gains.
	
	Q: What are the minimum system requirements to install Exchange Server on a
	server running Citrix WinFrame?
	
	A: The minimum software requirements are:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0
	
	- WinFrame Version 1.6 with Service Pack 4 or higher.
	
	The minimum hardware requirements are:
	
	- 100MHz Pentium
	
	- 32 MB of RAM
	
	NOTE: In most e-mail and groupware enterprising networks, it is not recommended
	that you run Exchange Server on a Citrix WinFrame server due to poor performance
	caused by the additional overhead.
