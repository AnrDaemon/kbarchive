	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Word 97 provides two type of containers for text: text boxes and
	frames.
	
	A text box is static: Its size does not change as you type additional text inside
	the text box. Instead, the text wraps below the bottom of the text box. The text
	below the bottom of the text box is not printed or displayed in online layout
	view.
	
	A frame is dynamic. In other words, the frame automatically grows to accommodate
	additional text that you type inside the frame.
