	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. Can I configure the FrontPage Explorer to use Word as its Web page
	  editor?
	
	  A. Yes. For additional information about how to do this, please see the
	  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q143095 Configuring FrontPage to Use an HTML Editor Other Than Explorer
	
	2. Q. Can I publish the Web pages that I create in Word to an intranet or
	  Internet server?
	
	  A. Yes. You can use the Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard to publish Web pages
	  either to an intranet or to an internet server. The Web Publishing Wizard is
	  stored in the Webpost.exe file located in the ValuPack\WebPost folder on the
	  Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Word 97 CD-ROM. The Webpost.exe file is a
	  self-extracting, self- executing program. To install the Web Publishing
	  Wizard, use the following steps:
	
	  a. On the Windows taskbar, click Start.
	
	  b. Click Run.
	
	  c. In the Open box, click Browse, select the ValuPack\WebPost folder on the
	     CD-ROM drive, select the Webpost.exe file, and then click Open.
	
	  d. Click OK.
	
	  For more information about the Web Publishing Wizard, go to the Microsoft Web
	  site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/Webpost/wp2.htm
	
	  If you are not using the Web Publishing Wizard, contact your Internet service
	  provider, Web master, or network administrator for information about how to
	  publish your Web content.
	
	3. Q. Can I use third-party ActiveX controls or controls that I download from
	  the Microsoft Web site when I create Web pages in Word?
	
	  A. Word adheres to an earlier version of the ActiveX Control standard and
	  requires services that some ActiveX controls for the Web do not support.
	  Although you may be able to insert these controls in your documents, they are
	  not guaranteed to work reliably. You can reliably use controls built using
	  Visual Basic 5.0 or the Visual Basic Control Creation Edition and controls
	  designed for Visual Basic 4.0.

	  Knowledge Base:

	4. Q. When I create a page in Word that uses tables, the page looks different in
	  a Web browser than it does in Word. When can I expect there to be differences
	  and how can I fix them?
	
	  A. In general, tables you create in Word look the same in Word as they do in a
	  Web browser if that browser supports tables. (Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0
	  and later or Netscape 2.0 and later support tables.) The following table
	  layouts are displayed differently in Word than they are in a Web browser:
	
	   - Tables that contain cells of unequal width appear to have equal width
	     cells in Word. For additional information, please see the following
	     article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q159549 Different-Width Cells Display as Equal-Width Cells in Browser
	
	   - Tables are not automatically adjusted to fit within the document window.
	     For additional information, please see the following article in the
	     Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q159866 How to Set Table Width to Percentage of Browser Window
	
	   - Pictures contained within table cells whose dimensions are not specified
	     may appear truncated on the right. This problem occurs because Word
	     resizes the cell to a default width. To display the entire picture, resize
	     the table column.
	   - Horizontal lines do not appear in Word when placed inside a table.
	
	5. Q. Does Word 97 support nested tables?
	
	  A. No. For additional information, please see the following article in the
	  Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q157774 Word 97 Can't Open HTML Document with Nested Tables
