	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you attempt to prevent Microsoft Phone version 1.0 from using the speaker
	phone to place a call by picking up the handset on your telephone before the
	call is placed, Microsoft Phone may still use the speaker phone to place the
	call.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the voice modem installed in your computer is unable
	to accurately detect the state of the handset. Some voice modems are unable to
	determine whether the handset is off the hook when a modem connection has not
	been established.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:
	
	- When you want to use the handset on your telephone instead of the speaker
	  phone, pick up the handset after Microsoft Phone places the call instead of
	  before.
	
	- Contact the modem's manufacturer to inquire about a possible firmware upgrade
	  that allows you to pick up the handset before Microsoft Phone places the
	  call.
