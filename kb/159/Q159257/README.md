	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Spike's World's chat may not always run when you try to access it.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because Chat runs only during special times, which are
	indicated on Spike's World.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Currently, the chat hours are from noon to 4 PM Pacific Standard Time.
	
	NOTE: That means that if you live in New York, which is on Eastern Standard Time,
	Chat is open from 9 AM to 1 PM.
