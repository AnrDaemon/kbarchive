	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The online help for the X.400 Connector "Schedule" property page says:
	
	  Select Always if you want the event to occur every 15 minutes.
	
	This incorrect. It should say:
	
	  Select Always if you want the event to occur whenever messages need to be
	  transferred.
	
	The Always option is documented in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's
	Guide. Microsoft has confirmed this to be an online documentation error in
	Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0.
