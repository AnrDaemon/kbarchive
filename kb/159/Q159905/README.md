	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you install Microsoft Plus!, some programs may no longer display
	non-standard mouse pointers. The mouse pointer may disappear when it is moved
	over some areas in a program.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the "Show icons using all possible colors" option is
	enabled. Windows-based programs are responsible for displaying their own mouse
	pointers; with some combinations of programs and display adapters, this option
	causes the behavior described above to occur.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Disable the "Show icons using all possible colors" option. To do so, follow
	these steps:
	
	1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.
	
	2. Click the Plus! tab.
	
	3. Click the "Show icons using all possible colors" check box to clear it.
	
	4. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The behavior described in this article has been noted in Microsoft Word,
	Microsoft Excel, and Windows 95 Help. In Word, the mouse pointer dis- appears in
	the left margin. In Microsoft Excel, the pointer disappears in a spreadsheet
	when it would normally appear as a cross. In Help, the pointer disappears over a
	link when it would normally appear as a hand.
