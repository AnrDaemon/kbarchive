	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. What is AutoText and how do I use it?
	
	  A. AutoText is a feature that allows you to store text or graphics you use
	  frequently. For example, you can store a mailing address that you use often,
	  a standard contract clause, or a long distribution list for memos. Each
	  selection of text or graphics is recorded as an AutoText entry and is
	  assigned a unique name. In previous versions of Word, AutoText entries were
	  referred to as Glossary entries. To use AutoText, follow these steps:
	
	  a. Click where you want to insert the AutoText entry.
	
	  b. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText.
	
	  -or-
	
	  On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, point to an item on the AutoText menu,
	  and then click the AutoText entry you want. For example, point to Salutation,
	  and then click Dear Sir or Madam.
	
	  NOTE: To see all AutoText entries based on a style, press and hold the SHIFT
	  key while you point to AutoText on the Insert menu.
	
	2. Q. How do I add text that I use frequently to the AutoText menu?
	
	  A. To create an AutoText entry, follow these steps:
	
	   - Select the text or graphic you want to store as an AutoText entry. To
	     store paragraph formatting with the entry, include the paragraph mark in
	     the selection.
	
	   - On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click New.
	
	   - In the Create AutoText dialog box, type a unique name for your AutoText
	     entry or accept the default, and then click OK.
	
	For additional information about adding AutoText to the AutoText menu, please see
	the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	3. Q. How do I get Word to display AutoComplete tips for words that I use
	  frequently?
	
	  A. To display AutoComplete tips, follow these steps:
	
	  a. Turn AutoComplete on.
	
	     1. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText.
	
	     2. Click the AutoText tab.
	
	     3. Click to select the "Show AutoComplete tip for AutoText and dates"
	        check box, and then click OK.
	
	  b. Create the AutoText entry.
	
	  c. In the document, type the AutoText name.
	
	     When the AutoComplete tip appears, press ENTER to accept the tip.
	
	4. Q. Why don't I get an AutoComplete tip for my new AutoText entry?
	
	  A. The AutoComplete tip does not appear in the following instances:
	
	   - The "Show AutoComplete tip for AutoText and dates" option is turned off.
	
	   - The AutoText entry is linked to the Signature style. The AutoComplete tip
	     is displayed when you type this AutoText entry at the beginning of a
	     paragraph only.
	
	   - The AutoText entry is linked to one of the Letter Wizard styles (excluding
	     the Signature style) and you typed it within a paragraph. The AutoComplete
	     tip is displayed when you type this type of AutoText entry at the
	     beginning of the paragraph only.
	
	   - You did not type enough characters for Word to identify the AutoComplete
	     tip. For example, if you have entries called "company logo" and "company
	     address," you need to type "company a" (without the quotation marks) to
	     display the AutoComplete tip for the company address. On the other hand,
	     if you have an AutoText entry for London called "Lond," and you do not
	     have other AutoText entries that begin with these four characters, all you
	     have to type is "Lond" (without the quotation marks) to view the
	     AutoComplete tip.
	
	5. Q. How can I replace one or more characters with a special symbol? For
	  example, how do I replace "ss" (without the quotation marks) with the section
	  symbol?
	
	  A. To automatically replace one or more characters with a symbol, follow these
	  steps:
	
	  a. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.
	
	  b. Click the symbol you want, and then click AutoCorrect.
	
	     The symbol you selected appears in the With box.
	
	  c. In the Replace box, type the characters you want replaced, and then click
	     Add.
	
	  d. Click OK.
	
	  e. Click Close.
	
	6. Q. How do I stop Word from automatically making changes to my document while
	  I type?
	
	  A. Word uses a feature called AutoFormat As You Type to automatically format
	  headings, bulleted and numbered lists, borders, numbers, symbols, and so on
	  as you type. Word also uses a feature called AutoCorrect to automatically
	  correct common typing, spelling, and grammatical errors. This feature can
	  also automatically insert text, graphics, and symbols. To turn off some or
	  all of the changes that AutoFormat As You Type makes, follow these steps:
	
	  a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect, and then click the AutoFormat As You
	     Type tab.
	
	  b. Click to clear any option you do not want to format automatically. Click
	     to select any option you do want to format automatically. If do not want
	     to use AutoFormat as you type, clear all options.
	
	  c. Click OK.
	
	  To turn off AutoCorrect, follow these steps:
	
	  a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect.
	
	  b. On the AutoCorrect tab, click to clear the "Replace text as you type"
	     check box.
	
	7. Q. How do I share my AutoCorrect entries with others?
	
	  A. AutoCorrect lists are now shared between Office programs. Any changes you
	  make to the AutoCorrect entries and settings while in one programs are
	  immediately available to the other programs. In addition, Word can store
	  AutoCorrect items consisting of formatted text and graphics. The following
	  articles contain information on how to share your AutoCorrect entries with
	  other users.

	8. Q. What is automatic style definition and how does it work?
	
	  A. Automatic style definition is an AutoFormat As You Type option (see
	  previous question and answer) that creates new paragraph styles based on the
	  manual formatting you apply to your text. You can apply these styles in your
	  document to save time and to give your documents a consistent "look and
	  feel." To turn on automatic style definition, follow these steps:
	
	  a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect, and then click the AutoFormat As You
	     Type tab.
	
	  b. Click to select the "Define styles based on your formatting" check box.
	
	  c. Click OK.
