	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you disable the TCP/IP Hostname column option in the Lexmark MarkVision
	program, a small column heading labeled "T..." is still visible on the heading
	bar. If you move the bar to show more of the column, the TCP/IP Hostname option
	is enabled again.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a known issue with the List control. This occurs in any program in which
	you try to disable the last column of an object. This is not a fault in
	MarkVision.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Contact Lexmark for information regarding an updated version of MarkVision.
