	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A File Transfer in the HelpDesk functions fails with a client computer running
	Windows 95 and Novell's Client32. The administrator will see the following error
	message on the Systems Management Server Administrator window:
	
	  Unable to communicate with File Transfer slave.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, set Permission Required to No. The Systems
	Management Server administrator can also try again. Eventually, this connection
	will be made, and File Transfer can continue.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
	information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
