	1. Q. Why doesn't the MSN Program Viewer open when I double-click the icon on my
	  desktop?
	
	  A. An error occurred during MSN Setup. Please follow these steps:
	  1. Restart your computer.
	
	  2. Double-click the MSN Program Viewer icon.
	
	  3. If it does not open, you will need to reinstall MSN.
	
	  4. Before reinstalling MSN, disable any anti-virus and/or TSR software.
	
	  5. To reinstall MSN, insert the MSN CD in your CD ROM.
	
	  6. The CD will walk you through MSN Setup again.
	
	2. Q. Why doesn't my Sign-In screen show up when I open the MSN Program Viewer?
	
	  A. The link to your Sign-In screen wasn't installed correctly. To re-establish
	  the link to your Sign-In screen, follow these steps:
	  1. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.

	  on the MSN icon on your desktop.
	
	3. Q. Why did my computer freeze when I tried to open the Communicate page?
	
	  A. You needed a new version of the MSN software. When you logged into MSN, it
	  should have detected this and downloaded the new software to your computer
	  automatically.
	
	  If your computer is still freezing when you try to open the Communicate page,
	  go to the following Web page
	
	  http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/mailupdate/default.htm
	
	  to download new software. This will update your MSN software.
	
	4. Q. How do I print a copy of a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)?
	
	  A. To print a copy of an FAQ, follow these steps:
	  1. Open the FAQ you would like to print.
	
	  2. Reveal the Internet Toolbar by clicking the upside down triangle in the
	     upper left hand corner of the MSN Program Viewer.
	
	  3. Click the printer icon on the toolbar.
	
	  4. Follow the steps for printing a document.
	
	5. Q. How do I turn on the RSACI Security Limits?
	
	  A. To turn on the RSACI Security Limits, follow these steps:
	  1. Click the MSN logo in the upper left hand corner of MSN Program Viewer.
	
	  2. Click Options.
	
	  3. On the Security tab, click Enable Ratings.
	
	  4. Type your supervisor password when you are prompted to, and then click OK.
	
	6. Q. How Can I Adjust the Security Limits Settings?
	
	  A. To adjust the security limits settings, use the following steps:
	  1. Click the MSN logo in the upper left hand corner of MSN Program Viewer.
	
	  2. Click Options.

	     the Rating slider to the appropriate setting. Repeat this step for each
	     category for which you want to adjust the level of allowed content.
	
	  6. Click OK until you return to MSN Program Viewer.
	
	7. Q. I am always being prompted for my Content Advisor password, how do I stop
	  it from asking me for it?
	
	  A. This is due to the RSACI (Recreational Advisory Council) limits, which you
	  chose to set during the MSN installation process to keep your kids safe
	  online. These security limits require you to enter a password before viewing
	  any page that has not been officially approved by RSACI.
	
	  To turn off the RSACI Security Limits, follow these steps:
	  1. Click the MSN logo in the upper left hand corner of your MSN Program
	     Viewer.
	
	  2. Click Options.
	
	  3. Select the Security tab.
	
	  4. Click the Disable Ratings button.
	
	  5. Click OK.
	
	8. Q. Can I use my browser?
	
	  A. If you enter MSN from the Internet rather than using the MSN icon, you can
	  switch back to your default browser at any time by using the standard Windows
	  95 taskbar interface (by pressing the ALT+TAB key combination, for example).
	
	9. Q. Why did I receive the error message Cannot Locate MSN Account
	  Information?
	
	  A. You are set up to use an Internet Service Provider other than MSN. To
	  change your connection settings to Internet and MSN access, follow these
	  steps:
	  1. Double-click The Internet icon on your desktop.
	
	  2. On the View menu, click Options.
	
	  3. On the Connection tab, click "Connect to the Internet as needed."
	
	  4. In the "Use the following Dial-Up Networking connection" box, click The
	     Microsoft Network.
	
	  5. Click OK.
	
	10. Q. Which version of Microsoft Internet Explorer should I be using with MSN?
	
	  A. MSN requires Internet Explorer (IE) version 3.01 or higher. If you have an
	  older version of IE, MSN Setup automatically installs a new version.
	
	  NOTE: During installation of IE, you are prompted to accept the IE End User
	  License Agreement. If you do not accept the license agreement, MSN Setup
	  terminates immediately without properly configuring you to access MSN. You
	  must accept the IE license agreement in order to use MSN.
	
	11. Q. How do I adjust the quality of sounds and music I hear on MSN?
	
	  A. Currently, you cannot adjust your sound quality. We are looking into
	  including this feature in a future release.
