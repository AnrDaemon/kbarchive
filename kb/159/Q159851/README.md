	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print rotated TrueType fonts in Microsoft Excel version 7.0 to a
	Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4, the resulting font may be different than you
	expected.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The HP LaserJet 4 printer driver included with Windows NT version 4.0 is
	incapable of rotating TrueType fonts. If you attempt to print a rotated TrueType
	font, the TrueType font is replaced with a font that can be rotated.
	
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
	4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
