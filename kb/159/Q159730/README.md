	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click to select the Automatically Save A Version On Close check box,
	Word does not automatically save a version of your document when you close it.
	Instead, Word saves a version of the document when you save the current
	document.
	
	The name of this option is misleading because it suggests Word will save a
	version when you close the current document.
	
	
	In addition, Word Help incorrectly states that a version of your document is
	saved when you close your document.
	
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To save a version of your document, use one of the following methods:
	
	Method 1.
	---------
	
	Manually save a version of your document, using the following steps:
	
	a. On the File menu, click Versions.
	
	b. In the Versions In <File Name> dialog box, click Save Now.
	
	c. Type any comments you want and then click OK.
	
	Method 2.
	---------
	
	Automatically save a version of your document, using the following steps.
	
	NOTE: When you use this method, Word saves an automatic version every time you
	click Save; Word does not save a version if you close the file.
	
	a. On the File menu, click Versions.
	
	b. In the Versions In <File Name> dialog box, click to select the
	  Automatically Save A Version On Close check box.
	
	  NOTE: This option must be set for each document.
	
	For more information about versions, click the Office Assistant, type "versions"
	(without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view "Review
	version information for a file."
