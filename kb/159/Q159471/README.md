	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Office 97 provides Far East support for the following four languages:
	
	- Japanese
	- Korean
	- Traditional Chinese
	- Simplified Chinese
	
	Far East support is not automatically installed with Office 97 or Word 97. To
	install Far East support as a separate component, see the "More Information"
	section of this article.
	
	When you install Far East support, you can:
	
	- Correctly display Far East characters in documents created with the Far East
	  version of Office 97. Without the Far East font, the characters appear as
	  block characters. NOTE: The Far East characters can be viewed but not edited.
	
	
	- Convert and view documents from Far East versions of Office 95. Without the
	  Far East support files, the Far East characters are lost.
	- Convert and view HTML documents in Office 97 programs and in Microsoft
	  Internet Explorer 3.0.
	- Correctly interpret file properties from documents created in the Far East
	  version of Office 97. Without the Far East support files, if you open a
	  document created with the Far East version of Word, the Properties dialog box
	  (available from the File menu) is blank in the United States version of Word.
