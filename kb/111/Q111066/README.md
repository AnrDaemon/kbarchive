	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you select the Land Me option, Land Me will either take control and land at
	an airport other than the one desired, or display the following error message:
	
	  Not close to any LAND ME airport
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Land Me is not available for all airports; it is available for selected airports
	only. If the aircraft is within range of one of these airports (approximately 60
	Nautical Miles) when the Land Me option is enabled, it will attempt to land at
	that location. If the aircraft is not within range, you will receive the error
	message shown above.
