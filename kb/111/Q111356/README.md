	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Instrument flight time is not added into the total for the flight in the
	logbook.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	There are two types of actual flight time: day and night. These are added
	together to calculate the total time of the flight. Instrument flight time is a
	separate measurement to determine the amount of time, day or night, spent flying
	under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) only. Instrument time is totaled in the
	logbook separately from day and night flight time.
