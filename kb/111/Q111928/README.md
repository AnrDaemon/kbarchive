	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	When you receive a fax in facsimile format, you cannot reply to the people
	listed on the carbon copy (CC) line by choosing the Reply All button. The fax
	numbers associated with those names are received in the fax header as a bitmap
	and cannot be extracted. The only number you can reply to using the Reply All
	button is the number of the fax sender.
