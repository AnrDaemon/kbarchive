	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	If you type the following at an MS-DOS prompt other than drive X, the Flight
	Simulator Setup program will not work properly:
	
	  x:\setup
	
	where x is the disk drive containing Flight Simulator 5.0 Disk 1.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Flight Simulator 5.0 Setup program (SETUP.EXE) cannot be started from any
	prompt other than the drive containing Flight Simulator 5.0 Disk
	
	The correct steps to install Flight Simulator 5.0 are as follows:
	
	1. Make sure your computer and monitor are turned on.
	
	2. Insert Microsoft Flight Simulator Disk 1 - Setup in drive A or Drive B, and
	  close the drive door, if necessary.
	
	3. Change to the drive where you inserted Disk 1. For example, if Disk 1 is in
	  drive A, type "a:" (without the quotation marks) and then press ENTER.
	
	4. Type "setup" (without the quotation marks) and then press ENTER.
	
	5. Follow the instructions on the Setup screens to install Flight Simulator.
	
	  To cancel installation at any time, press the ESC key or click Cancel.
	
	6. When the installation is complete, you will have three options to choose
	  from:
	
	  a. If you want to start flying right away, click Run Microsoft Flight
	     Simulator.
	
	  b. If you own an add-on program, such as Aircraft & Scenery Designer
	     version 5.0 or later, and want to install it now, choose Install Add-On.
	
	  c. If you want to exit to MS-DOS and return to Flight Simulator later, click
	     Exit To MS-DOS.
	
	These installation instructions are listed on page 3 of the Microsoft Flight
	Simulator Pilot's Handbook.
