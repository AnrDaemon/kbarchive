	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Point-to-Point Server updates the Remote Access
	files currently shipping with Windows for Workgroups 3.11. The Point- to-Point
	Server enables a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 system to accept incoming calls
	from other Remote Access clients (such as those currently included with Windows
	for Workgroups 3.11). This allows anyone with the necessary password to access a
	computer's shared resources from any remote PC.
	
	You can obtain this Application Note from the following sources:
	
	- Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet
	
	- The Internet (Microsoft anonymous ftp server)
	
	- Microsoft Product Support Services
	
	For more information, see the "To Obtain This Update" section at the end of this
	article. If you don't have a modem, you can obtain this update from the
	Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) by calling (800) 426-9400 and asking
	for part number 261-050-010.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Point-to-Point Server enables remote users to
	gain access only to the resources shared on the local machine. If remote users
	need access to all shared network resources (such as shared files and printers
	located elsewhere on the network), the computer answering the incoming calls
	must be running Microsoft Windows NT, Windows NT Advanced Server, or Microsoft
	LAN Manager in addition to Remote Access Service. This ensures that greater
	security is available before entire network access is granted.
