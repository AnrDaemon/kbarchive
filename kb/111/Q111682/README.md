	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups
	-------------------------------------------
	
	The Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups (WFWTCP.EXE) includes the NDIS 2
	protocol stack to support connecting computers running Windows for Workgroups
	together or computers running Windows for Workgroups to Windows NT and Windows
	NT Advanced Server using the TCP/IP protocol. Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for
	Workgroups does not include any TCP/IP utilities; however, support for the
	Windows Sockets Interface is provided, which allows any Windows
	Sockets-compatible TCP/IP utility (including terminal emulators and file
	transfer software) to be used.
	
	NOTE: See the READTCP!.TXT file for initial installation instructions and the
	included MSTCPIP.HLP file for detailed installation instructions with Windows
	for Workgroups 3.11.
	
	Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups
	----------------------------------------------
	
	The Microsoft TCP/IP-32 version 3.11b (TCP32B.EXE) is the latest update to the
	TCP/IP-32 stack for Windows for Workgroups 3.11. It has been updated since
	version 3.11a and includes a number of fixes, primarily to provide compatibility
	with several third-party WinSock applications, and to correct problems with
	using DNS to resolve NetBIOS names. This also has updated code related to
	Windows 95. This update is a complete refresh of TCP/IP-32 (WFWT32.EXE) and
	contains all components of the product.
	
	This product is compatible with and supported exclusively on Windows for
	Workgroups version 3.11. If you are running a different TCP/IP product on your
	computer, you must remove it before installing Microsoft TCP/IP-32. For
	information on this TCP/IP-32 Update, please see the following article in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q122544 UPDATE.TXT: TCP/IP-32 3.11b for Windows for Workgroups
	
	
	Microsoft Data Link Control (DLC) Protocol for Windows for Workgroups
	---------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Microsoft Data Link Control (DLC) Protocol for Windows for Workgroups
	(WFWDLC.EXE) includes the NDIS 2 protocol stack that allows computers running
	Windows for Workgroups to operate in IBM SNA environments and to connect to
	mainframes and minicomputers, such as the AS/400. The DLC interface is most
	commonly used by 3270 terminal emulators to communicate to IBM mainframes.
	Support of these emulators is the main role of the Microsoft DLC protocol.
	Products from companies such as DCA, Attachmate, IBM, Microcom, and Wall Data
	support the Microsoft DLC protocol.
	
	NOTE: See the READDLC!.TXT file for initial installation instructions and the
	included MSDLC.HLP file for detailed installation instructions with Windows for
	Workgroups 3.11.
