	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Version 3.1d of Mail for AppleTalk Networks contains the following
	enhancements:
	
	1. A new Out of Office feature that automatically replies to or forwards any
	  mail sent to a user while that user is away. This feature does not require
	  that the user's workstation be left running.
	
	  The Out of Office server is HyperCard SDK based and requires HyperCard 2.1 or
	  later.
	
	2. The ability to move users and their related information, including Microsoft
	  Schedule+ data, more easily to other servers. Moving users also updates
	  system-defined groups on servers that are available on the network at the
	  time of the move.
	
	3. An enhanced rebuild utility for the Mail Data file. This rebuild attempts to
	  retain Gateway, Routing, and Custom Form information.
	
	4. The ability to create users and gateway account recipients from text files
	  using the Mail Network Administrator program.
	
	5. A more accurate reflection of the minimum amount of memory your server needs.
	
	6. The ability to reset server statistics for an entire site with one command.
	
	7. The ability to initiate a network scan on command and view the status.
	
	8. The ability to view queued messages by date or size, and return queued
	  messages to their senders.
	
	9. The ability to reset local mail file passwords without rebuilding the Local
	  Data File.
	
	10. The ability for the network administrator to receive notification of the
	  existence of new servers.
	
	11. Resizable Note and 80-Column forms for all users.
