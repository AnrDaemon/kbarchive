	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you create a menu with more than five levels of nesting, only the first five
	levels are displayed. You do not receive an error message. The menu will
	properly indicate another level with an arrow, but the menu cannot be activated.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	In FoxPro for Macintosh, menus are limited to five levels of nesting. This is a
	limitation of the Macintosh operating environment.
	
	Although you can hand-code a menu or use the Menu Builder to design a menu that
	goes deeper than this, only the first five levels will be displayed.
