	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	COMMAND key+<number> assignments are reserved to mimic function key
	operations on the Macintosh.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Many Macintosh computers do not have keyboards containing function keys (F1
	-F15). In order to give these machines the same functionality, the
	COMMAND+<number> key combination is typically reserved.
	
	This means that in FoxPro for Macintosh, these key assignments, if used as
	shortcut keys in menus, will yield a key label and key text of F<#>.
	
	Additional query words: vFoxMac FoxMac keystroke hot hotkey access key accelerator
