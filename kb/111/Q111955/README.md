	- MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Windows NT Resource Guide, Volume 1 of the Windows NT Resource Kit,
	incorrectly describes a technical diagram of the Windows NT networking
	model in Chapter 15, titled "Windows NT Networking Architecture." In the
	first and second paragraph on page 572, it states:
	
	  ...Figure 15.5 includes network adapter cards to illustrate that you can
	  use multiple network adapter cards on a computer running Windows NT.
	
	  The model also shows a serial driver and serial card.
	
	These statements are incorrect because figure 15.5 on page 571 does not
	show network adapter cards nor serial cards. It illustrates only the
	physical layer.
