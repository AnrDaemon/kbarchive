	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you try to use keyboard commands to control throttle or reverse thrusters in
	Flight Simulator, the intended function may not respond, or it may respond only
	intermittently.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur when you use certain joysticks in combination with the
	keyboard. Some controller devices send a continuous stream of information to the
	computer. This information may take priority over the information that you send
	through your keyboard. In some situations, this may cause the behavior described
	in the "Symptoms" section of this article.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods, as appropriate to your
	situation.
	
	Update Your Joystick Device Driver
	----------------------------------
	
	It may be possible to resolve this issue by installing updated device drivers for
	your joystick.
	
	For information about how to contact the manufacturer of your joystick to obtain
	updated device drivers, click the appropriate article number in the following
	list to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

	Recalibrate Your Joystick

	steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
	documentation to complete these steps.
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
	  Gaming Options.
	
	2. Click the Controllers tab, click your controller in the Game Controllers
	  window, and then click Properties.
	
	3. Click the Settings tab, and then click Calibrate.
	
	4. Follow the instructions to calibrate your joystick.
	
	Turn Off (Disable) Your Joystick
	--------------------------------
	
	1. Start Flight Simulator, and then click Settings.
	
	2. Click to clear the Enable Joystick check box.
	
	Use a Different Joystick
	------------------------
