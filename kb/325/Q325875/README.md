	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use custom decals in MechWarrior 4, follow these steps:
	
	1. Save your custom decals in the following folder
	
	  <drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\MechWarrior
	  Vengeance\Content\Textures\Customdecals
	
	  where <drive> is the drive on which MechWarrior 4 is installed.
	
	  NOTE: This path assumes a default installation and might be different on your
	  computer.
	
	2. To turn on custom decals, start MechWarrior 4, click Multiplayer, click
	  Options, and then click to select the Allow Custom Decals check box.

	NOTE: Custom decals may take a long time to load by modem. If you use custom
	decals in games that are run on modem servers, the mission load time may be
	long. Administrators of modem servers may want to disallow the use of custom
	decals.
