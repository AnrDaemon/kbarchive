	If the Microsoft mouse does not work in Microsoft Windows, you should
	verify that it works at the MS-DOS level. To do so, perform the following
	steps (note that you must have the mouse driver installed first and the
	CPANEL.COM program available):
	
	1. At the DOS prompt, change to the drive and directory in which you have
	  CPANEL.COM and type CPANEL to load the mouse control panel.
	
	2. While holding down CTRL+ALT, click either mouse button.
	
	The mouse control panel appears, and, if the mouse is operating properly,
	you should see the mouse cursor on the screen and be able to move it.
	
	Refer to the "Microsoft Mouse User's Guide" for additional information.
