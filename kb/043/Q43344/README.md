	When using a PS/2 style mouse port, you cannot deallocate the memory
	the mouse driver is using. The Mouse Off switch disables only the
	mouse. However, the memory will be deallocated if a bus or serial
	mouse is used.
	
	The following machines have PS/2 style mouse ports:
	
	1. COMPAQ 286e, 386s, 386e, and 386 20e
	
	2. IBM (all PS/2's)
