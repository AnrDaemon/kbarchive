	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Please note that the Mail server maintains two lists of users: a list of local
	users, and a list of all users as seen in the Address Mail window. The Mail
	server does not update its list of all users until it broadcasts its new list of
	local users to other Mail servers on the network. It may take a short while for
	the new users to show up in your server's list of all users; however, they
	should appear in the list of local users immediately.
