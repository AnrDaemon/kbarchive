	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To use NetWare for the Macintosh, create the following setup:
	
	1. Connect your Macintoshes in a standard AppleTalk network and connect your PCs
	  in a standard Novell network.
	
	2. Connect one PC to the AppleTalk network as well as to the Novell PC network.
	
	3. Set up this PC to run the NetWare 2.15 file-server software, which allows
	  Macintoshes and PCs access to the same files stored on the file server's hard
	  disk. NetWare 2.15 also allows PCs access to printers on the AppleTalk
	  network; however, Macintoshes do not have access to printers on the Novell PC
	  network.
