	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following information describes how to use the Address Mail window features
	in Microsoft Mail.
	
	1. To only display a list of users defined on your Mail server, click the Local
	  icon.
	
	2. To display a list of all users on the Mail system, click the All icon. This
	  list includes the group(s) defined on your server.
	
	3. In the Type Names box, type the name of a recipient. If you want to send a
	  message to more than one recipient, do the following:
	
	  a. Separate the recipient names with semicolons.
	
	  b. Press ENTER or click the Add button.
	
	  If you do not know the name of a recipient, you can find it in one of the
	  following three ways:
	
	   - In the Type Names box, you can type the first few characters of the name
	     (or several partial names separated by semicolons), and then click the Add
	     button. The users or groups whose names start with these characters are
	     displayed in the Choose Names list.
	
	  -or-
	
	   - You can search for a string of characters in the recipient's name by
	     typing the string of characters in the Type Names box, then clicking the
	     Find Name button. All names that contain the string of characters are
	     displayed in the Choose Names list.
	
	
	  -or-
	
	   - You can also search for a recipient by server name. The process is
	     basically the same as the one described above. The only difference is that
	     the @ (at) sign must be the first character typed in the Type Names box
	     (there should be no space between the at sign and the characters). For
	     example, to find recipients on the server named "Accounting Server," type
	     the following:
	
	  " @Accounting Server" (without the quotation marks)
	
	4. You can add a recipient directly from the Choose Names box by double-clicking
	  the name or by clicking the name once and pressing ENTER. To add multiple
	  names at one time, do one of the following:
	
	   - Hold down the SHIFT key and click the names.
	
	  -or-
	
	   - Select a range of names by dragging the mouse. Once the names are
	     selected, press ENTER or double-click one of the names.
	
	5. If you make a mistake, select the names you want to remove from the Message
	  Recipients list box and click the Remove button.
	
	6. To close the Address Mail window and return to the Send screen, click the
	  Close button.
	
	7. To carbon copy or blind carbon copy a recipient, click the Cc: or Bcc:
	  options prior to choosing the recipient.
