## Q43783: No Color in QB Editor with Tandy RGB Adapter on Tandy 1200

{% raw %}

	Article: Q43783
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 4.50
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | SR# S890215-61 | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 27-APR-1989
	
	It has been reported that the QuickBASIC Version 4.50 editor does not
	display colors with a Tandy RGB video adapter on a Tandy 1200.
	Microsoft has not tested QuickBASIC Version 4.50 with the Tandy RGB
	video adapters, and we do not claim compatibility with the Tandy RGB
	adapters. Running QuickBASIC Version 4.50 with a Tandy RGB video
	adapter may result in display or editor problems.
	
	It has also been reported that invoking the QB.EXE editor with the /h
	(high resolution) switch corrects this problem.
	
	Microsoft has not confirmed this information.
