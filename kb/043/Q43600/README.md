## Q43600: MS123.COM May Not Work in Lotus 1-2-3 with Look &amp; Link Add-On

	Article: Q43600
	Product(s): See article

	MS123.COM may not work properly in Lotus 1-2-3 if Look & Link (a Lotus
	1-2-3 add-on by Personics) is being used.
	
	The workaround is to load MOUSE.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file instead of
	loading MOUSE.COM in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
