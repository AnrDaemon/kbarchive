	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
	- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you run SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 in a Distributed Link
	Service (DLS) environment, network outage notifications (Event 23) may not be
	logged in the Application event log on the branch server.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The SNA Server Service does not reset a certain internal field, so that events
	are not logged if a dropped connection restarts and is subsequently dropped
	again.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	SNA Server 4.0
	--------------
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
	phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
	address on the World Wide Web:
	
	  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS
	
	NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
	be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
	update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
	
	The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
	later:
	
	+------------------------------------+
	| File name    | Date        | Time  | 
	+------------------------------------+
