	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After the Protected Storage service accesses a user's private key, an
	unencrypted copy of the key remains in the computer's memory. This copy of the
	private key remains stored in random access memory (RAM) even when the user logs
	off the computer and another user logs on.
	
	In a highly secure environment, this may be a security vulnerability.
