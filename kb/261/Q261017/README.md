	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Motocross Madness 2, some ground textures may appear in
	the sky.

	This behavior can occur if a Guillemot Maxi Gamer Phoenix 2 AGP video adapter is

	box that is displayed on the screen when you start the game.
	
	If you do not see this dialog box when you start the game:
	
	1. On the Motocross Madness 2 startup screen, click Options ([GRAPHIC:the three
	  gears]).
	
	2. Click Advanced.
	
	3. Click to select the "Show 3-D Renderer Selector at Startup" check box.
	
	4. Click Back ([GRAPHIC:the pointing hand]) until you return to the Motocross
	  Madness 2 startup screen.
