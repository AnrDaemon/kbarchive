	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Allegiance, you may experience both of the following
	symptoms:
	
	- When you attempt to yaw to the left, the throttle increases.
	
	- When you attempt to yaw to the right, the throttle decreases.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if you are using a Logitech Cyberman 2 3-D game
	controller.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, use a pointing device to maneuver in Allegiance.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The CyberMan 2 is a 6-axis gamepad with a built-in joystick. The joystick
	controls the following movements:
	
	- Move the joystick forward or backward to control the pitch.
	
	- Move the joystick to the left or right to control the yaw.
	
	- Rotate the joystick to control the roll.
	
	- Angle the joystick to the left or right to control the throttle. (This motion
	  is very similar to the yaw control).
