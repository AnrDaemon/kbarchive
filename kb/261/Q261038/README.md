	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Motocross Madness 2, version 2.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Motocross Madness 2, video clips (including the
	introductory video) may not be displayed properly.
	
	In addition, textures may be distorted on the starting gate and waypoint gates,
	and areas of the sky may appear smeared.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:
	
	- An ATI 3D Rage 128 GL AGP video adapter is installed in your computer.
	
	- An AMD K6-2 microprocessor is installed in your computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	You may be able to work around this issue by configuring the 3-D renderer to use
	Software Rasterization.
	
	To do this, click Software Rasterization in the "Please Choose a 3-D Card" dialog
	box that is displayed on the screen when you start the game.
	
	If you do not see this dialog box when you start the game:
	
	1. On the Motocross Madness 2 startup screen, click Options.
	
	2. Click Advanced.
	
	3. Click to select the "Show 3-D Renderer Selector at Startup" check box.
	
	4. Click the Return To Previous Screen button until you return to the Motocross
	  Madness 2 startup screen.
	
	5. Quit and then restart Motocross Madness 2.
