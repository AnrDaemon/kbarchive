	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Motocross Madness 2, textures in the game may appear
	blocky or jagged.

	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if an SIS 6326 AGP video adapter is installed in your

	box that is displayed on the screen when you start the game.
	
	If you do not see this dialog box when you start the game:
	
	1. On the Motocross Madness 2 startup screen, click Options ([GRAPHIC:the three
	  gears]).
	
	2. Click Advanced.
	
	3. Click to select the "Show 3-D Renderer Selector at Startup" check box.
	
	4. Click Back ([GRAPHIC:the pointing hand]) until you return to the Motocross
	  Madness 2 startup screen.
