	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	During normal operation or in Safe mode, your computer may play "Fur Elise" or
	"It's a Small, Small World" seemingly at random. This is an indication sent to
	the PC speaker from the computer's BIOS that the CPU fan is failing or has
	failed, or that the power supply voltages have drifted out of tolerance. This is
	a design feature of a detection circuit and system BIOSes developed by
	Award/Unicore from 1997 on.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Although these symptoms may appear to be virus-like, they are the result of an
	electronic hardware monitoring component of the motherboard and BIOS. You may
	want to have your computer checked or serviced.
