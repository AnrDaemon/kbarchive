	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to use the mouse as a flight yoke while you play Microsoft
	Flight Simulator 2002, you are unable to do so. The aircraft does not respond to
	mouse movements during the game.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the mouse is not supported as a flight yoke in this
	version of Microsoft Flight Simulator.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, use keyboard commands to fly the aircraft, or install a
	supported game controller.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Earlier versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator supported the use of a mouse as
	the flight yoke during the game. In Flight Simulator 2002, you can use a game
	controller or keyboard commands to control the flight of the aircraft.
