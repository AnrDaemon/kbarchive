	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you attempt to import or link more than 10,000 street addresses, you may
	receive an error message similar to one of the following:
	
	  Streets & Trips can only import 10,000 addresses at one time.
	
	  MapPoint can only import 10,000 addresses at one time.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue occurs because these programs are only capable of importing 10,000 or
	fewer addresses at one time.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this issue, separate your data into two or more files, and then
	import the files separately. To import addresses, follow these steps:
	
	1. Start the program.
	
	2. On the File menu, click Import Data.
	
	  The Import Data Wizard starts.
	
	3. Click the file that you want to import, and then click Open.
	
	4. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the process.
