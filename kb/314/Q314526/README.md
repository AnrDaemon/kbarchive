	occur with the Norton Personal Firewall or Norton Internet Security programs.

	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, disable, or adjust the settings of, your firewall
	software. Then restart your Encarta program and join Club Encarta. Note that the
	program must be restarted after changing your firewall settings.
	
	For more information about your firewall software, refer to the firewall program
	Help files or user manual, or contact the manufacturer.
	
	To work around this issue if Norton Internet Security is installed on your
	computer, follow this step:
	
	1. Exit your Encarta program.
	
	2. Exit Internet Explorer.
	
	3. On the taskbar, right-click the NIS icon, and then click Disable.
	
	4. If the NIS icon doesn't appear on the taskbar:
	
	  a. Click Start, click Programs, then double-click Norton Internet Security.
	
	  b. Click Show in taskbar, and then click Disable.
	
	5. Start your Encarta program and join Club Encarta.
