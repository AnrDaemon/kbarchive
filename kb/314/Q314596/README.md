	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	In Microsoft Streets & Trips 2002 or Microsoft MapPoint 2002, you may not be
	able to see any elementary schools or high schools on the map. Only some
	colleges and universities are visible.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if the map is configured to not display schools.
	
	Some components of colleges and universities may be grouped in the "Landmarks"
	category. If the map is configured to display landmarks, you can view these
	colleges and universities, or components of them, on the map.

	1. Start Streets & Trips or MapPoint.
	
	2. On the View menu, click "Show or Hide Places".
	
	3. Click the Places tab.
	
	4. Click to select the Schools check box, and then click OK.
	
	  All schools are now visible on the map.
