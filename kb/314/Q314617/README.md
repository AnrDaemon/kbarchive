	When you start a second round of Solitaire Bowling in Microsoft Bicycle Card
	Games, the score from the first round remains on the scoreboard.

	To work around this issue, quit Solitaire Bowling, start a different game in
	Bicycle Card Games, and then restart Solitaire Bowling. When you start a
	different game, this forces Solitaire Bowling to release and clear the previous
	score.
