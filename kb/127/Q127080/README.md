	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you change from Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation to
	Microsoft Mail for Windows, you will have a Personal Address Book (PAB) instead
	of a Personal Address List (PAL).
	
	The PAL is used by the MS-DOS client and has limited use in Mail for Windows. You
	can select names from the PAL when addressing mail, and you can also get
	details. However, you cannot add new addresses to the PAL from Mail for Windows.
