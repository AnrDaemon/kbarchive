	Item ID   Filename       Description
	-------   --------       -----------
	
	Snumber   GOTCHA.EXE     The GOTCHA.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        article named "A Grab Bag of Gotchas and Goodies
	                        for Programming in Windows 95," by Dave Edson.
	
	                        Dave Edson discusses the design issues that are
	                        important to consider when you code Windows 95-
	                        based applications. He also updates you on the
	                        Windows 95 interface changes that have been
	                        implemented since his summer 1994 series of
	                        articles.
	
	S15236    WIN95VXD.EXE   The WIN95VXD.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        article named "Extend Your Application with
	                        Dynamically Loaded VxDs Under Windows 95," by
	                        Walter Oney.
	
	                        With Windows 95 (unlike with its 16-bit
	                        predecessors), you can load and unload VxDs
	                        dynamically. Walter Oney shows you how to use
	                        a dynamically loaded VxD to virtualize a high-
	                        resolution Pentium timing feature for use by a
	                        performance-monitoring application.
	
	S15237    OLEAUTO.EXE    The OLEAUTO.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        article named "Design Considerations for
	                        implementing a Simple OLE Automation Controller,"
	                        by Kraig Brockschmidt.
	
	                        The goal of OLE automation is to make possible
	                        cross-application macro programming using a wide
	                        range of automation controllers. Kraig Brock-
	                        schmidt shows you how to implement an automation
	                        controller that calls an object's IDispatch()
	                        functions and handles exceptions.
	
	S15238    CQA0595.EXE    The CQA0595.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        "C/C++ Q & A" column by Paul DiLascia.
	
	S15239    DQA0595.EXE    The DQA0595.EXE file contains the code for the
	                        "MS-DOS Q & A" column by Jeff Prosise.
