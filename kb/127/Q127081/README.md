	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	MAPIVIM.DLL is a dynamic-link library file that is included with the Microsoft
	Office Standard and Professional packages. MAPIVIM.DLL is designed to allow
	Microsoft Office applications, such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word running
	on PC Networks that have vendor independent messaging (VIM) electronic mail
	messaging systems (Lotus Corporation's CC:Mail, for example), to have limited
	electronic mail functionality.

	(MAPI), it was not designed for the development of messaging applications on VIM
	electronic mail environments. The use of MAPIVIM.DLL as a software development
	tool is not supported by Microsoft, nor can Microsoft guarantee the results from
	using MAPIVIM.DLL as an API.
