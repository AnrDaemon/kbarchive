	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are running Windows 95 on a notebook computer that supports Advanced
	Power Management (APM), the Suspend command on the Start menu does not seem to
	work when the notebook computer is connected to an external power source.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Some notebook computers have BIOS support for disabling APM functionality while
	the computer is connected to an external power source. If this option is enabled
	on your notebook computer, the APM features in Windows 95 will not function
	while the computer is connected to an external power source.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To change this behavior, modify the computer's BIOS settings to enable APM
	functionality while the computer is connected to an external power source. For
	information about how to do this, please refer to the computer's documentation,
	or contact the computer's manufacturer.
