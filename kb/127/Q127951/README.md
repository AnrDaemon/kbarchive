	- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Microsoft Mail Connection Name Utility is used to import Microsoft Mail for
	PC Networks gateway names into Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks. These
	names will first appear in the Gateway Recipients screen.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	These imported gateway names will appear in the server's All list or global
	address list when the server rebuilds its global address list. However, this
	process can take a short period of time, depending on the volume on your
	server.
	
	To verify that the new names have been added and that modifications and deletes
	have taken place, look at the list of names in the Gateway Recipients screen
	when you sign in as Network Manager. From the Mail menu, choose Gateway: Gateway
	Recipients. The list of names in this window can be considered the master list
	of gateway names for all gateways.
