	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to play any game on the Zone (for example, Internet Backgammon),
	you may receive the following error message:
	
	  Error: Cannot launch game. A Web page error is preventing the game from
	  opening. Try refreshing the page, or try again later.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur if an antivirus program or firewall program, such as
	Norton Antivirus or Norton Internet Security, is installed and running on your
	computer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, quit all antivirus and firewall programs before you try
	to play games on the Zone. For more information about your antivirus or firewall
	program, use the program's Help feature, see the program's manual, or contact
	the manufacturer.
	
	NOTE: When you quit these programs, the antivirus or firewall protection that
	these programs provide becomes unavailable. To restore the protection, restart
	these programs when you finish playing games on the Zone.
