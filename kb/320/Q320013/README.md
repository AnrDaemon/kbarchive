	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	After you join Club Encarta and then use Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia
	to view an Encarta Online Deluxe article, you may receive an error message
	similar to the following when you try to sign in to Encarta Online Deluxe:
	
	  Encarta Online Deluxe does not recognize this Passport sign-in.
	
	  If you have more than one Passport, your access to Encarta Online Deluxe may
	  be associated with another Passport. Remember that your Hotmail and MSN
	  e-mail addresses are also Passports.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur for any of the following reasons:
	
	- You have Encarta Encyclopedia Standard. Articles that are marked "Deluxe"
	  require Deluxe access. Deluxe access is available only to those who have
	  Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe or Microsoft Encarta Reference Library.
	
	  -or-
	
	- The Passport is not registered with Club Encarta. You may have more than one
	  Passport (one that is registered and one that is not).
	
	  -or-
	
	- The Passport is not registered for use with Online Deluxe. You may have more
	  than one Passport (one that is registered and one that is not).
