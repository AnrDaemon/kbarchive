	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you try to view a map in Streets and Trips 2002, the exit symbols do not
	appear on the map.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur for the following reasons:
	
	- The Exit Services check box is not selected.
	
	- The font or display settings are incorrect for this program, or your video
	  card drivers are corrupted or incorrect.
	
	NOTE: This behavior may also occur because the geographical information for those
	exits was not provided by the cartographer. This information may have been
	provided in earlier versions of Streets and Trips.
