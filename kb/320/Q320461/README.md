	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you play Microsoft Flight Simulator and turn on the Real-World Weather
	feature, the weather in the game may either be incorrect or may stay the same
	every day.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior may occur if your Temporary Internet Files folder contains old
	copies of the weather data files, and the files are not replaced with new
	information.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this issue, empty your temporary Internet files folder before you
	turn on Real-World Weather. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	1. Quit Flight Simulator.
	
	2. Start Internet Explorer.
	
	3. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options.
	
	4. On the General tab, click Delete Files under "Temporary Internet files", and
	  then click OK.
	
	5. Start Flight Simulator, and then open the flight that you want to fly.
	
	6. On the World menu, click Weather.
	
	7. Click to select the Local Weather check box, and then click "Real-world
	  weather".
	
	8. Click OK.
	
	Flight Simulator updates the weather to the current conditions for the flight's
	current location.
