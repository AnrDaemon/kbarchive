	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	While you fly any of the following planes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002,
	the landing lights are not visible from the cockpit, and the virtual cockpit is
	not available:
	
	- Mooney Bravo
	
	- Learjet 45
	
	- Schweizer 2-32 Sailplane
	
	- Sopwith Camel
	
	- Cessna 182RG
	
	While you fly the Extra 300S stunt plane, no landing lights are available. (The
	virtual cockpit is available.)
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Not all the planes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 have virtual cockpits or
	the ability to let you see the landing lights from the cockpit. These are new
	features in Flight Simulator 2002. The planes in the list in the "Symptoms"
	section of this article have not been updated to include these new features.
	
	NOTE: The Extra 300S stunt plane has no landing lights because the actual (or
	"real-world") plane has no landing lights.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To fly with landing lights, do either of the following:
	
	- Switch to a spot plane view, from which you can see the landing lights.
	
	- Select a different plane. Planes that are not mentioned in the "Symptoms"
	  section of this article have landing lights that are visible from the
	  cockpit.
	
	To fly with a virtual cockpit, select a plane that is not on the list in the
	"Symptoms" section of this article.
