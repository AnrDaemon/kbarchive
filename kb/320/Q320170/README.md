	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You cannot type in the body of a new MSN Explorer e-mail message. The font does
	not appear or appears as white font matching the background. The e-mail font may
	be viewable when received by the addressee.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This issue can occur for any of the following reasons:
	
	- You have Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or greater and you are running
	  Microsoft Office 97--Office 97 contains corrupted registry entries that
	  occurred during the installation process. This corruption causes the spelling
	  checker feature to fail and as a result you cannot compose e-mail messages in
	  MSN Explorer version 6.1/7.0.
	
	- Rich Text Editor is not enabled for MSN Explorer e-mail.
	
	- MSN Messenger is corrupt or not installed.
