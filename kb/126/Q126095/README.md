	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Windows NT 3.5 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) incorrectly lists the
	NCR StarLan 16/4 TokenRing NAU as a supported network adapter. Currently,
	Microsoft does not provide a driver for the NCR StarLan 16/4 TokenRing NAU.
	
	The entry in the HCL contains a footnote that references you to the Windows
	NT driver library to obtain the device driver. The Windows NT driver
	library does not include a device driver for the NCR StarLan 16/4 TokenRing
	NAU. Microsoft is currently working on a driver for this network adapter.
