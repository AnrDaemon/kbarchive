	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	AlisaMail provides connectivity for MSMAIL and VMS mail systems. Alisa appears
	on the network as another Mail server. It is not a gateway. The purpose of the
	AlisaMail program is to propagate addresses from other mail programs on various
	platforms (usually a VMS or UNIX system) using a Directory Synchronization type
	program. Because of the various platforms that they interact with, AlisaMail
	does not provide details to the mail programs that they are providing addresses
	to (for example, MS Mail).
	
	For more information, contact Alisa Systems at (800) 992-5472.
