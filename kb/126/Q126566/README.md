	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are typing, quotation marks ("), carets (^), apostrophes ('), and
	tildes (~) do not appear until you press another key.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs when you have the US-International keyboard layout loaded,
	and is designed to let you use accented characters without remapping the
	keyboard.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To change this behavior, use the International tool in Control Panel to change
	the keyboard layout from US-International to US.
