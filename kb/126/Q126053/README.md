	SYMPTOM
	-------
	
	The Resource Kit Tools for Microsoft Windows NT Help file (RKTOOLS.HLP)
	lists a tool called "NTDETECT.COM: Startup Hardware Detector" in the Setup
	and Troubleshooting Tools section. When you choose it to find more
	information, the following two statements are displayed:
	
	- At the command prompt, switch to the \RESKIT directory where the Resource
	  Guide utilities are installed, and type INSTALLD.
	
	- Files required for NTDetect:
	
	  INSTALLD.CMD
	  NTDETECT.COM
	
	The two files, INSTALLD.CMD and NTDETECT.COM, do not exist in the RESKIT
	directory. They also do not exist in the source compact disc or disks of
	the Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 Resource
	Kit. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
	Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
