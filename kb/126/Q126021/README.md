	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When choosing the Clock Buttons in The Ultimate Haunted House Help screen, Gahan
	explains that you can access the Help screen, in any room of the haunted house,
	by pressing COMMAND+H on the keyboard. There is not a COMMAND key on an
	IBM-compatible keyboard.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Hold down the CTRL key and press H (the CTRL+H key combination) to view the Help
	screen from any room in the haunted house.
	
	The Clock Buttons sound file originated from the Macintosh version of Microsoft
	Gahan Wilson's The Ultimate Haunted House. Macintosh computers have a COMMAND
	key on their keyboards, which function like the CTRL key on a standard
	IBM-compatible computer keyboard.
