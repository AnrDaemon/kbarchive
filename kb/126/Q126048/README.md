	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you print a card from Creative Writer to an Epson Stylus Color printer, you
	may experience one of the following problems:
	
	- You may receive an error message stating that the disk is full, or the
	  program may stop responding (hang).
	
	  -or-
	
	- The printer may print a blank sheet of paper. With Creative Writer 1.x, this
	  is followed by McZee's message, "I've finished printing your document. That
	  was fun!"
	
	  -or-
	
	- The card may begin printing and hang midway through printing.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Use the following steps to resolve the problem:
	
	
	Windows 95
	----------
	
	1. Click the Start button, point at Settings, and then click Printers.
	
	2. Click the Epson Stylus with the right mouse button and click Properties.
	
	3. Click the Graphics tab, and set Resolution to 180 dots per inch.
	
	4. On the printer, select the Condensed Print option. This option makes the
	  print darker.
	
	Windows 3.x
	-----------
	
	1. In the Main program group in Program Manager, double-click the Control Panel
	  icon.
	
	2. Double-click the Printers icon.
	
	3. Click the Epson Stylus, then click Setup and set the resolution for printer
	  output to 180.
	
	4. On the printer, select the Condensed Print option. This option makes the
	  print darker.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Under Windows 3.x, Creative Writer may exit to Program Manager when you are
	printing because the Epson Stylus Color printer driver versions 1.03 and 1.04
	installs its own print manager.
	
	When Epson's print manager becomes active, Creative Writer is automatically
	minimized. To restore Creative Writer to full-screen, double-click the Creative
	Writer icon.
