{% raw %}

	Article: Q126411

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you exit a screen saver that is included with Microsoft Windows 95, the
	full-screen MS-DOS window is not restored. Instead, the MS-DOS window is
	minimized to a button on the taskbar.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Windows 95 is not designed to restore MS-DOS windows to full-screen mode.
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this behavior, run the MS-DOS-based application in a window or
	click the application's button on the taskbar.
	
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This behavior also occurs for other Windows-based applications. For example,
	type "start wordpad" (without quotation marks) in a full-screen MS- DOS window.
	When WordPad starts, the MS-DOS window is minimized. When you quit WordPad, the
	MS-DOS window remains minimized.
