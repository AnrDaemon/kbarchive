	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Page 815 of the "Win32 Programmer's Reference," volume 2, mentions the "Microsoft
	Win32 Remote Procedure Call Programmer's Guide and Reference."
	
	Microsoft Press does not distribute the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Programmer's
	Guide. This guide is included in electronic form with the Microsoft WIN32
	Software Developer's Kit (WIN32 SDK) CD-ROM.
	
	Correction:
	
	After the RPC Programmer's Guide is named, the following words should be appended
	to the sentence:
	
	  ...available in electronic form as part of the Microsoft WIN32 Software
	  Developer's Kit (WIN32 SDK).
	
	Comments:
	
	The "Microsoft Win32 Remote Procedure Call Programmer's Guide and Reference" is
	only available in electronic form. As of December 8, 1994, the only way you can
	obtain this guide is by purchasing WIN32 SDK on CD- ROM.
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
