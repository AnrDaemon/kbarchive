	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Selecting Reply All to a routing form will create a Compose Note message with
	only the previous recipient on the To: line. None of the other recipients of the
	routing form are placed on the To: line.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
	for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The purpose of the routing form is to allow information to be sent sequentially
	to several users. The Reply All function does not have meaning in this context
	and should be unavailable to users for a routing form.
