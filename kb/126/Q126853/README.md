	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you install Windows NT version 3.5 on a Compaq computer with a Microspeed
	Trackball mouse and a Quantum LPS528A (Type 65, 527.5 MB) IDE hard disk, Setup
	stops responding (hangs) at the Welcome to Setup screen. This problem does not
	occur in Windows NT version 3.1 or with hard disks from manufacturers.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The Microspeed Trackball mouse is not on the Windows NT version 3.5 Hardware
	Compatibility List (HCL) and is not supported.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To correct this problem, use a supported trackball mouse.
