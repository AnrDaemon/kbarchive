	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.1, 1.1a 
	- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.1, 1.1a 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The number of people using the CD-ROM version of Creative Writer or Fine Artist
	is limited to approximately 227 users, or approximately 64K of disk space.
	
	There is no limit on the number of users in Creative Writer and Fine Artist,
	version 1.0, on floppy disk.
	
	There is no known workaround at this time.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The 64K limitation exists in version 1.1 and 1.1a because the list of users is
	kept in a Windows initialization (.INI) file for task switching. Windows
	maintains a limitation of 64K on all .INI files. Although the limit is stated as
	64K, functionally it is often between 59-62K. The Macintosh version has the same
	limitation, although not for the same reason.
	
	The floppy disk version of Creative Writer and Fine Artist, version 1.0, has no
	limit on the number of users, other than the physical size of the hard drive.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer and Fine Artist
	version 1.1 and 1.1a for Windows and for the Macintosh. We are researching this
	problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
	becomes available.
