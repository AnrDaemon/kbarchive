	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	During the installation of The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright, an icon is created
	to access the program. The installed icon for Frank Lloyd Wright can change to
	the Windows default icon because the working directory and the program files are
	located on the CD-ROM drive.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Workaround 1
	------------
	
	1. Insert The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright CD into the CD-ROM drive.
	
	2. Open the Program Manager group that contains The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright
	  icon.
	
	3. Select the Frank Lloyd Wright icon by clicking it once (do not double-click
	  it).
	
	4. From the File menu, choose Properties.
	
	5. Choose the Change Icon button.
	
	6. Choose OK.
	
	7. Select OK from the Program Item Properties dialog. A Network Path Specified
	  dialog box appears with the message:
	
	  The specified path points to a file that may not be available during later
	  Windows sessions. Do you want to continue?
	
	  NOTE: This message is by design because the working directory for The Ultimate
	  Frank Lloyd Wright is located on the CD-ROM drive, and CD-ROM drives are
	  viewed as network drives by the operating system.
	
	8. Choose the Yes button.
	
	The Windows default icon changes to The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright icon.
