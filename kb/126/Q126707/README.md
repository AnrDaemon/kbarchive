	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	In level 70 of Chip's Challenge, Chip must pass over several brown buttons that
	release different monsters from bear traps. The monsters chase Chip as he makes
	his way through the maze.
	
	However, two of the brown buttons, one on the lower-left part of the maze and one
	on the lower-right part of the maze, do not activate the bear traps associated
	with them. As a result, Chip can pass around two of the monsters without being
	hindered.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In this level, titled Nightmare, Chip has 199 seconds to complete the maze. Chip
	does not have to pick up any computer chips, but he does have to be quick to
	avoid capture by any monsters. Several brown buttons along the route of the maze
	release a monster from a bear trap. Chip must avoid these monsters to finish.
	
	In separate areas of the maze, two of the bear traps, one holding a paramecia and
	the other holding a tooth monster do not get activated when Chip passes over the
	associated brown buttons. As a result, Chip has easy passage through these parts
	of the maze.
