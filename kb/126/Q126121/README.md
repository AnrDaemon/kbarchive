	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
	include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
	"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
	address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
	contains specific information for working around problems.
	
	Page 161: Tip Selects but Cannot Delete Non-contiguous Lines
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The tip on page 161 describes how to make non-contiguous selections. This tip
	works correctly; however, it is inappropriate for this tip to be under the
	heading "Deleting Fields," since you will not be able to delete fields selected
	in this way.
	
	Correction:
	
	This tip should be removed from page 161.
	
	Comments:
	
	The tip is technically correct, and it is useful for some actions other than
	deleting fields. A future edition of the book will incorporate this information
	in a more appropriate location.
	
	DISK: PROMPT.MDB not on disk.  (Need to run Install)
	----------------------------------------------------
	
	The companion disk does not contain a file named PROMPT.MDB. However, there is a
	non-Microsoft Access file named PROMPT.CMP.
	
	The Prompt Database is compressed on the 3.5-inch disk as PROMPT.CMP. To properly
	install this file, run INSTALL.EXE from the companion disk. The Install program
	automatically decompresses the Prompt database. Please see page xxiv for
	companion disk installation instructions.
	
	
	Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
	comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
	printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
	already contain most or all of the above corrections.
