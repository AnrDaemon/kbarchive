	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Haunted House for Windows, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The icon for Haunted House may change to a default Windows icon.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This occurs because the working directory and the program file are located on
	your CD-ROM drive.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Change the properties of the Haunted House icon. Choose an icon using the
	Haunted House icon file, located in the directory where you installed the
	program (usually C:\MSKIDS\HHOUSE).
	
	For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
	printed documentation or online Help.
	
	While making the change, you may receive the message:
	
	  The working directory is invalid.
	
	Click OK. This message occurs when the Haunted House CD is not in the drive.
	
	You also may receive this message:
	
	  The specified path points to a file that may not be available during later
	  Windows sessions. Do you want to continue?
	
	Click Yes to continue.
