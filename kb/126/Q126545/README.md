	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are using two network adapters connected to two separate Novell
	networks using the Microsoft client for Novell NetWare or a Novell NetWare
	Workstation shell, Windows 95 sees only one of the two networks.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Only one instance of the Microsoft client for Novell NetWare or the Novell
	NetWare Workstation shell can be installed in Windows 95. The first of the two
	network adapters to receive a response from a NetWare server will be the active
	network adapter.
