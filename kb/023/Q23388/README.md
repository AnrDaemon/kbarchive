## Q23388: CTRL+UP and CTRL+DOWN ARROW Keys No Longer Scroll the Screen

{% raw %}

	Article: Q23388
	Product(s): See article
	Version(s): 3.00
	Operating System(s): MS-DOS
	Keyword(s): ENDUSER | B_BasicCom | mspl13_basic
	Last Modified: 22-JAN-1990
	
	CTRL+UP ARROW and CTRL+DOWN ARROW do not scroll the screen in QB.EXE
	in QuickBASIC Version 3.00, but they do in QuickBASIC Versions 2.00,
	2.01, 4.00, 4.00b, 4.50, in the QB.EXE editor that is included with
	Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS, and in
	the QBX.EXE editor of Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System
	(PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.
	
	Changes were made in the QuickBASIC Version 3.00 editor to allow
	Superkey support; support for CTRL+UP ARROW and CTRL+DOWN ARROW was
	removed during this change. In the non-3.00 product versions above,
	these keys successfully scroll the screen down or up one line at a
	time.
