	The information in this article applies to:

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	It is possible for a corrupted IP packet received over PPTP to cause your system
	to bugcheck. This problem only occurs when you run PPTP.
	
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is caused by a corrupted datapacket, where the Frame Length given
	in the packet header was longer than expected. This caused the code that read
	that frame to be confused and to corrupt memory, which in turn lead the computer
	to stop responding (hang). The fix verifies that the Frame Length provided in a
	packet is not larger than the system expects. Microsoft believes this error to
	be rare, and the fix to be safe.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
	the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
