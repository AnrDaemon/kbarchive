## Q230677: Malformed Phonebook Entry Security Vulnerability in RAS Client

	Article: Q230677
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3,4.0 SP4

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) client software may allow a user with the
	proper permissions to mount a denial-of-service attack or elevate his or her
	privileges on a RAS client computer.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because the RAS client component that processes phonebook
	entries has an unchecked buffer. As a result, a specially malformed RAS
	phonebook entry can cause the RAS client to crash.
	
	In very specific conditions, it can cause arbitrary code to run on the client
	computer. Because the RAS client operates in the security context of the local
	computer, the arbitrary code also runs in this context. This cannot occur
	accidentally.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0

	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the

	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
	listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
	Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This vulnerability affects only computers running the RAS client software; it
	does not affect RAS servers. A user must have permission to add or modify
	phonebook entries to initiate an attack. Permissions can be set using the
	phonebook's access control list (ACL).
	
	Computers at risk because of this vulnerability are workstations that are
	configured to dial other computers as servers, including Microsoft Windows NT
	4.0, Terminal Server Edition, but are not typically configured to act as RAS
	clients. This vulnerability affects only local computers; a user cannot directly
	attack remote computers.
