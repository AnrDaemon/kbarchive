## Q230014: RRAS Does Not Report Domain Name for Users in Accounting Packets

	Article: Q230014
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix

	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When a Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) server is set up to forward
	requests to Microsoft Radius (Internet Authentication Service IAS) for
	authentication, the RRAS server is not forwarding the domain name within the
	accounting request to radius. Therefore, when accounting or analysis is done,
	the domain name for users cannot be identified in the log files.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior occurs because RRAS strips off the domain name before sending the
	accounting packet.
