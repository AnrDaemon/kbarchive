## Q230331: XFOR: SMTP Address Generator Includes Consecutive Periods

{% raw %}

	Article: Q230331
	Product(s): Microsoft Exchange
	Version(s): winnt:5.5
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): exc55 EXC55SP3Fix
	Last Modified: 06-AUG-2002
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You can modify the proxy address generated by the system in Microsoft Exchange
	Server. If you set your site SMTP proxy address to the following:
	
	  %g.%1i.%s@<domain_name>.com
	
	an illegal SMTP address may be generated if there is no middle initial on the
	mailbox. The generated address will contain a consecutive multiple period (.)
	sequence. For example, if the name on the mailbox is John Doe, the generated
	address is:
	
	  John..Doe@<domain_name>.com
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The logic in the address generator does not look to see if a consecutive
	multiple period sequence is included in the address.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
	version 5.5. For additional information, click the following article number to
	view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
	
	The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
	later:
	
	Component: SMTP
	
	+--------------------------+
	| File name   | Version    | 
	+--------------------------+
	| Inproxy.dll | 5.5.2596.0 | 
	+--------------------------+
	
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	Set the address to %g.%i.%s@<domain_name>.com. The drawback is if a full
	middle name is entered, then the full middle name will be included in the SMTP
	address.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
	version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
	Pack 3.
