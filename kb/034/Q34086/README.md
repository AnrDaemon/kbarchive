## Q34086: Mouse Menu for Quattro

{% raw %}

	Article: Q34086
	Product(s): See article

	The Lotus 1-2-3 mouse menus on the Mouse Expert Menus disk do not
	enable the pop-up menus in Quattro. To use the mouse with Quattro,
	install DEFAULT.COM or MSMENU.COM.
	
	MSMENU.COM allows you to scroll through the spreadsheet and select
	menu items with the mouse. The menus do, however, need to be activated
	with the SLASH (/) key. The menus function the same whether or not
	Quattro is loaded with the Lotus 1-2-3 menu tree.
	
	Note: DEFAULT.COM is now called MSMENU.COM.
