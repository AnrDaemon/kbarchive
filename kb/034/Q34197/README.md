	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Problems have been reported when using a mouse connected to the built-in mouse
	port on IBM PS/2 computers with Flight Simulator Version 3.00. The program will
	load successfully, but after a few minutes the mouse will begin moving the yoke
	erratically and executing commands from the menus.
	
	A workaround is to configure the mouse as a serial mouse and connect it to an
	available serial port. This method will work only if the mouse is not an IBM
	mouse, which must be connected to the built-in PS/2 mouse port.
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Flight Simulator Version 3.00.
	This problem was corrected in Version 4.00.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The built-in PS/2 mouse port is a 6-pin plug located adjacent to the keyboard
	port on the back panel of the PS/2.
