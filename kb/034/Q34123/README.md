	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Localizer is used in ILS landings. It is a sort of VOR that can be used only
	on one radial, which is lined up with the runway. You tune it in on your NAV
	radio like a normal VOR station, but you do not set the OBI to a radial
	direction, because the direction is set automatically. Needle movement is four
	times as sensitive as a normal VOR station, so you can hold your horizontal
	course very precisely.
	
	You can lock on the Localizer frequency by tuning in to the ATIS for the six
	airports that have the ILS landing capabilities. The following six airports will
	give you a localizer frequency.
	
	  Martha's Vineyard
	  Champaign, Illinois
	  Snohomish County (Paine field)
	  Van Nuys, California
	  Metro Oakland International
	  Chicago-O'Hare International (Runway 27R)
