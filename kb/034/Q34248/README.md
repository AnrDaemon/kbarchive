## Q34248: Flight Simulator: Automatic Scenery Not Loading

	Article: Q34248
	Product(s): Microsoft Home Games
	Version(s): 3.00 4.00
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): 
	Last Modified: 30-JUL-2001
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Option A, Automatic Scenery Loading, appears on the Scenery Library menu (from
	the NAV/COM menu, choose Option 2, Scenery Load) only if there are two or more
	converted scenery files in the Flight Simulator subdirectory. If you select
	Option A and a scenery file is available for the area in which you are flying,
	that scenery file is supposed to be automatically loaded and used while you fly
	within its boundaries; however, this feature is not functional in Microsoft
	Flight Simulator version 3.00. You must manually load the scenery file from the
	Scenery Load menu after setting its position to the desired scenery area (from
	the NAV/COM menu, choose Option A, Position Set).
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 3.00.
	This problem was corrected in Flight Simulator version 4.00. Updated or new
	Microsoft software can be ordered in the US by contacting Microsoft End User
	Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400. International customers should see

	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	In Flight Simulator version 4.00, Automatic Scenery Loading works properly if
	the Converts program properly handles the scenery disk being used. Some newer
	SubLOGIC scenery disks require a different SubLOGIC CONVERTS.EXE program. For
	information about using scenery disks, contact SubLOGIC Corporation at (800)
	637-4983.
