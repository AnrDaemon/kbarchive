	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 2.11, 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft does not give out any information about undocumented system features.
	If calls, flags, or interrupts are undocumented, it is because they are not
	supported; we can give NO guarantee that they will exist in future releases of
	MS-DOS. If you find out about these features (through articles or by chance) and
	begin using them in your programs, there is a real potential that your
	application will not work in future MS-DOS versions.
	
	We strongly advise against using undocumented features for these reasons and will
	give out no information about their use.
