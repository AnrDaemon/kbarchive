	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	As of May 27, 1997, Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 is no longer available
	for sale in the retail channel or Microsoft Select. This is consistent with our
	BackOffice strategy to not offer a previous version of a product 90 days after
	the current version ships.
	
	Although this product will not be available after May 27, Microsoft Premier
	Support will continue to provide support for Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 and
	will continue to provide QFE fixes and Service Packs until May 1998. At that
	time, Microsoft Premier Support will continue to offer support but will not
	commit to providing QFE fixes and Service Packs.
