	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
	- Microsoft Expansion Pack for Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you install the Expansion Pack for Flight Simulator for Windows 95, it will
	disable the ground scenery for the default USA-Los Angeles area. The Expansion
	Pack scenery will override the Los Angeles area airports.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	This is by design. The Southern California scenery area included in the
	Expansion Pack disables the local scenery for Los Angeles supplied in Flight
	Simulator for Windows 95. To select a Los Angeles area airport, you must use the
	Southern California scenery option instead of the USA-Los Angeles option.
	
	Do the following to select the Southern California scenery:
	
	1. From the World Menu click Go To Airport...
	
	2. From the Scenery Area drop-down list box, select Southern California.
	
	3. Select the desired airport from the Airport drop-down list box.
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	This information is detailed in the README.TXT file located on the Expansion Pack
	compact disc.
