	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	For information on using NetMeeting with Microsoft Proxy Server or other
	firewalls, please refer to Chapter 4 of the NetMeeting Resource Kit. The
	Resource Kit is available at the following URL:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/NetMeeting/Corp/ResKit/default.ASP
	
	The following excerpt from the NetMeeting Resource Kit applies to Microsoft Proxy
	Server versions 1.0 and 2.0:
	
	  FIREWALL LIMITATIONS
	
	  Some firewalls cannot support an arbitrary number of virtual internal IP
	  addresses, or cannot do so dynamically. With these firewalls, you can
	  establish outbound NetMeeting connections from computers inside the firewall
	  to computers outside the firewall, and you can use the audio and video
	  features of NetMeeting. Other people, though, cannot establish inbound
	  connections from outside the firewall to computers inside the firewall.
	  Typically, this restriction is due to limitations in the network
	  implementation of the firewall.
