	NOTE: If your computer is not set up for multiple user profiles, when you run
	Protect It! for the first time you will receive the following message:
	
	  In order for your computer to recognize multiple family members, Protect It!
	  has changed the login process for your system. Protect It! needs to restart
	  Windows so that these changes take effect before you can set any Protect It!
	  options.
	
	  Restart Windows Now?
	
	This message means that the ability for Windows to keep separate profiles for
	each user that logs on to your computer has been added. This setting is
	available on the User Profiles tab in Password Properties located in the Windows
	Control Panel as the "Users can customize their preferences and desktop
	settings. Windows switches to your personal settings whenever you log in"
	option.
