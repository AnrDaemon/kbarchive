	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you click the Connections link to manually download the connections file,
	you see a Web page filled with numbers and codes. You are not given the option
	to download the file.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The file extension used by Connections (.M7W or .C7W) is a registered file type.
	Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 recognizes this as a data file and displays the
	contents of the file.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To download the file, use your right mouse button to click the Connections link,
	and then click Save Target As.
	
	To avoid this problem, use the "Bring Me Up to Date" feature instead of manually
	downloading the Connections file. This feature is available in the program, or
	via a link on the Web site.
