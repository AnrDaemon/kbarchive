	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When using certain Corel 6.0 fonts, such as Dutch 801, some characters may be
	different than if you were using another font, such as Times New Roman. This
	difference occurs if you select an input locale other than English. For example,
	if you select the Serbian (Latin) input locale and Croatian keyboard, and then
	type the characters 0230, 0232, 0198,and 0200, they will be different than if
	you were using the same characters from the Times New Roman font set.
	
	
	STATUS
	======

	problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
