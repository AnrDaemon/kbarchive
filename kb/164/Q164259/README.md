	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Some AMD2100/AMD1500T network cards (for example, the embedded network card on
	Hewlett Packard Vectra systems) have problems with the network boot disk, which
	is created with the Windows NT Client Administrator. The system stops responding
	after the network card driver is loaded. With a newer AM2100.dos driver from
	AMD, the system works fine.
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
	researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
