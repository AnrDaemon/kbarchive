	This article contains a list of the system requirements for Microsoft Office 97,
	Developer Edition.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Office 97, Developer Edition combines the developers kits for the
	Office programs into one all-inclusive kit. Office programs no longer have
	separate developers kits as do earlier versions of Microsoft Office. The reason
	for this is that each Microsoft Office program shares a common programming
	language, Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. To use the Microsoft Office
	97 Developer Edition, you need:
	
	- Personal or multimedia computer with a 486 or higher processor
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation
	  3.51 with Service Pack 5 or later (will not run on earlier versions)
	
	- For use on Windows 95: 8 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM)
	  required to run programs individually (12 MB required to run Microsoft
	  Access); more memory may be required to run additional programs
	  simultaneously
	
	- For use on Windows NT Workstation: 16 MB of RAM required to run programs
	  individually; more memory may be required to run programs simultaneously
	
	- 92-210 MB of available hard disk space required; approximately 140 MB
	  required for a typical installation, depending on configuration. Use the
	  Office Upgrade Wizard during setup to maximize free disk space.
	
	- CD-ROM drive
	
	- VGA or higher-resolution video adapter (Super VGA, 256-color recommended)
	
	- Microsoft Mouse, Microsoft Intellimouse, or compatible pointing device
	  Additional items or services required to use certain features:
	
	- 9600 or higher baud modem (14.4 baud recommended)
	
	- Multimedia computer required to use sound and other multimedia effects
	
	- Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Exchange, Internet SMTP/POP3, or other MAPI-
	  compliant messaging software required to use e-mail
	
	- The "Publish to the Web" feature in Microsoft Access requires Microsoft
	  Internet Information Server for Windows NT or Microsoft Personal Web Server
	  for Windows 95.
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server required for certain advanced workgroup
	  functionality in Microsoft Outlook
	
	- Some Internet functionality may require Internet access and payment of a
	  separate fee to a service provider.
