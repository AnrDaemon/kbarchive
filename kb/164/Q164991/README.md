	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Word 97 Help refers to the Tables7.dot template as a source of additional Word
	macros for working with a table:
	
	  The macros supplied with Word are stored in templates installed in the Macro
	  subfolder of the Word program folder. For example, the template Tables7.dot
	  contains a set of sample macros you can use when working with Word tables.
	
	This information is incorrect. Microsoft Word 97 for Windows does not include the
	Tables7.dot template.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
