	========
	
	When you use Word as your e-mail editor to track changes in an Outlook message
	reply, if you delete text from the original message, it is not marked with
	revision marks. Deleted text is removed from the message. Any other changes to
	the message reply are shown correctly.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To enable Word as your e-mail editor in Outlook, from the Outlook program, click
	Options on the Tools menu, and select the E-mail tab.
	
	The following Word features are available from Outlook if you use Word as your
	e-mail editor (note that Word 97 must be installed to use these features):

	- Spell It. Checks your spelling while you work, underlining misspelled words
	  and displaying alternative spellings.
	
	- Bullets and Numbering. Add bullets and numbering to call out important
	  points.
	
	- Tables. Use tables to present your information in an organized fashion.
	
	- Highlighter. Use color to emphasize the key points in a message for others

	- Conversion of e-mail names and Internet addresses. Automatic conversion of
	  e-mail names and Internet addresses to hyperlinks.
