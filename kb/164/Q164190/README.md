	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	When you use Microsoft Plus! For Kids Protect It! to set access restrictions on
	your computer, you will not be able to restrict access to the Network
	Neighborhood if the computer is on a network.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Microsoft Plus! For Kids was designed for stand-alone home computers, not for
	computers on networks. Therefore, the Network Neighborhood cannot be restricted
	using the Protect It! program. Similarly, Dial-Up Networking is not disabled by
	Microsoft Plus! For Kids, Protect It!, although a universal modem restriction
	can be put in place for a family member.
	
	Even though Protect It! cannot prevent access to the Network Neighborhood, it is
	possible to limit access to network shares and set up user-level passwords
	through the Network tool located in Control Panel. For more information about
	performing these tasks in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or
	online Help.
