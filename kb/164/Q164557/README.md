	================
	
	A profile contains a specific set of information services. When you install the
	Microsoft Exchange Client, you must create a profile, unless your administrator
	has created one for you.
	
	If you have created additional profiles for other configurations, you can select
	which profile you want to use each time you start the client or you can start
	the client with a specific profile.
	
	To select a profile when starting the Microsoft Exchange Client:
	
	1. On the Tools menu in the Viewer, click Options, and then select the General
	  tab.
	
	2. Under "When Starting Microsoft Exchange," select one of the following:
	
	   - To automatically use a specific profile each time you start the client,
	     select Always Use This Profile, and then select the profile name in the
	     list below.
	
	   - To be prompted to choose the profile you want to use each time you start
	     the client, select Prompt For A Profile To Be Used.
	
	3. Click OK.
