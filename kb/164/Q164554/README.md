	When you join a different site and/or domain that is localized (for example,
	French or German) by connecting to the SMS_SHR share and running the Runsms.bat
	batch file, the text in the installation window is not localized. The
	installation window shows the following message:
	
	  You are logged on to a different Site/Domain Combination.
	
	This text should appear in the site's default language, which is not always
	English.
