	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	During Windows for Workgroups Setup, the two program information files
	(PIFs) _DEFAULT.PIF and DOSPRMPT.PIF are overwritten.  Windows for
	Workgroups Setup overwrites these two files to ensure that they are in
	the proper format for a Windows 3.1 PIF. Windows 3.0 PIFs have
	slightly different formats.
	
	To preserve any changes you might have made to these files, rename
	them before you run Setup.
