	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following two sections relate information on two similar, battery-saving
	features of COMPAQ portable computers:
	
	- Pressing ALT+TAB on COMPAQ SLT
	
	- Pressing Sleep button on COMPAQ portables
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Pressing ALT+TAB on COMPAQ SLT
	------------------------------
	
	On a COMPAQ SLT/286, the screen may go blank after you press ALT+TAB to switch
	from Windows to an MS-DOS-based application. This symptom is directly related to
	the COMPAQ PowerCon utility.
	
	PowerCon can be disabled by running the COMPAQ Setup utility provided with the
	system. This alleviates the problem, but does not provide the power conservation
	features offered by PowerCon.
	
	PowerCon conserves battery life by shutting down the display and hard disk after
	a specified period of inactivity. The ALT+TAB combinations prematurely trigger
	the PowerCon utility.
	
	Pressing Sleep Button on COMPAQ Portables
	-----------------------------------------
	
	Some COMPAQ portable computers have a Sleep button. Pressing this button
	temporarily suspends computer operations to save battery life. If you press this
	button while Windows is running in the foreground, you may not be able to regain
	control of your computer without restarting. However, if you start MS-DOS
	Prompt, and then press the Sleep button, the computer goes into "sleep" mode and
	then resumes, just as the manual says it should.
