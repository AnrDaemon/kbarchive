	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	If you try to use Media Player to play CD audio and the compact disc you are
	attempting to play does not contain audio information on track 1, you may
	receive the following error message:
	
	  There is a problem with your media device. Make sure it is working correctly
	  or contact the device manufacturer.
	
	WORKAROUND
	==========
	
	To work around this problem, you may be able to drag the thumb tab in Media
	Player to track 2 (or the first track that contains audio information). Also,
	other CD-audio programs, such as Musicbox, may allow this type of compact disc
	to be played.
	
	Some CD-ROM drives (for example, those that use the TSLCDR.SYS driver in the
	CONFIG.SYS file) do not allow the thumb tab to be dragged in Media Player. Users
	with this driver cannot play CD-ROM disks with non-audio tracks through Media
	Player.
