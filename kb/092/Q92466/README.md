	- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Windows for Workgroups and Windows File Manager represent a RAM drive as a RAM
	chip icon on the toolbar. If the RAM drive is compressed by Stacker 2.0, Windows
	for Workgroups and Windows display the icon as a local hard disk drive icon.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Windows and Windows for Workgroups File Manager use drive icons for quick access
	to the available drives. There are five types of drive icons that File Manager
	uses:
	
	- Floppy disk drives
	
	- Hard disk drives
	
	- RAM drives
	
	- CD-ROM drives
	
	- Network drives
	
	If Stacker disk-compression software is used on a RAM drive, File Manager does
	not display the normal RAM chip icon for the RAM drive. It uses a local hard
	disk drive icon for the RAM drive. This does not have any affect on the
	functionality of the RAM drive.
