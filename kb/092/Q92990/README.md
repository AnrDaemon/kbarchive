	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 does not include software to
	support remote access to a LAN Manager or a Windows for Workgroups network.
	
	The Microsoft Remote Access Service (RAS) version 1.1 client for Windows for
	Workgroups is available from Microsoft. It provides the ASYBEUI protocol that
	allows a computer using a modem and running the RAS 1.1 client to call up a LAN
	Manager server running the RAS 1.1 server software. The Windows for Workgroups
	workstation can then access remote network resources as if it were on the
	network.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================

	1.1 client support is a fee-based service. RAS 1.1 server installation support
