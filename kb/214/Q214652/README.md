	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you open a Word document or RTF format file that is attached to a template
	that contains macros, the macro virus warning message may not appear. Word
	provides a macro warning message when a document that contains a macro is
	opened; however, if that document is attached to a non-trusted template that
	contains a macro, no warning is issued.
	
	Microsoft Word considers documents and templates that are stored in either the
	user templates folder or the workgroup templates folder as trusted, or free of
	unwanted macro viruses. To determine where Word is storing your trusted user and
	workgroup templates, click Options on the Tools menu, and then click the File
	Locations tab.
