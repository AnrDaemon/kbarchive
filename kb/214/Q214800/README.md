	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Chapter 3 of Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 Enterprise Developer's Workshop
	includes sample code for a program called MenuDemo. This code is included in the
	book and on the companion CD-ROM. However, the code references several files
	that do not exist on the companion CD-ROM. These files are msmenu.js and
	msmenu.css.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Microsoft Press has created a replacement self-extracting executable to resolve
	this problem. Our replacement for the MenuDemo files does not require the
	msmenu.js and msmenu.css files.
	
	The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
	
	  Vi6edw1.exe
	  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vinterdev60pro/mspress/2.0/WIN98Me/EN-US/Vi6edw1.exe)
