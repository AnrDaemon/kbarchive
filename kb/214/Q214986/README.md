	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you are printing software metering usage reports with the Software Metering
	Report Wizard, the Euro currency symbol (?) may not print.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem is most often associated with Hewlett Packard printers. If the
	printer uses an internal font, or if it downloads the font from the printer, and
	then prints in graphics mode, the problem may occur.
	
	Newer Hewlett Packard printers that use internal fonts should correctly print the
	Euro symbol.
