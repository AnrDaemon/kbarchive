	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The Difficulty Settings slider in Microsoft Close Combat III: The Russian Front
	also acts to balance the opposing forces. As a result, when you set the
	Difficulty Setting for the Player or the Host, the Difficulty Setting for the
	Computer or the Client is set automatically.
	
	This behavior is most evident in head-to-head play: when the Host chooses a
	Difficulty Setting of Hero, the Difficulty Setting for the Client is set
	automatically to Recruit.
