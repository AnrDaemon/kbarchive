	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you mark an area to avoid and then calculate a route in Microsoft Expedia
	Streets and Trips 2000, the route may pass through the area you marked to avoid.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions are true:
	
	- The zoom level you are using does not display sufficient map detail to
	  accurately mark the area to avoid.
	
	- The area you mark to avoid does not contain a street or highway intersection.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To prevent this issue from occurring, set your zoom level to 48 miles or lower,
	and make sure the area you mark to avoid contains a street or highway
	intersection. To do this:
	
	1. Move the zoom slider to the right to a zoom level of 48 miles or less.
	
	2. On the Route menu, click Plan A Route.
	
	3. In the Routing pane, set the start point, the end point, and then add the
	  stops you want.
	
	4. On the Route menu, point to Avoid Area, and then click Mark An Area To Avoid.
	
	5. On the map, use your pointing device to click and drag over the area you want
	  to avoid. Make sure this area contains a street or highway intersection.
	
	  NOTE: You may need to zoom to a different level to display the entire area you
	  want to avoid.
	
	6. In the Routing pane, click Calculate.
