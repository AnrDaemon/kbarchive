## Q224585: TCB Hash Function Modified to Improve Network Performance

	Article: Q224585
	Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
	Version(s): winnt:4.0
	Operating System(s): 
	Keyword(s): kbWinNT4sp6fix
	Last Modified: 16-MAY-2002

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Network performance degrades as user sessions increase.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	TCP creates and maintains a hash table of transmission control blocks (TCBs) to
	store data for each TCP connection. A control block is attached to the table for
	each active connection. The control block is deleted shortly after the
	connection is closed. One aspect of connection overhead is the time it takes to
	search the Transmission Control Block (TCB) table. Therefore, an optimum hash
	function helps improve network performance.
	
	RESOLUTION
