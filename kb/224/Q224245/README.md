	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you switch from another program to Microsoft Expedia Streets and Trips
	2000, you may receive the following error message
	
	  Couldn't find the Microsoft Expedia Streets & Trips 2000 CD-ROM in drive
	  <cd-rom>:. Ensure that the CD is correctly inserted in your
	  <cd-rom>: drive, then click OK (or click Cancel to exit the
	  application).
	
	where <cd-rom> is the drive letter of your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.
	
	If you click Cancel, you quit the program. If you click OK or attempt to use the
	program without inserting the CD-ROM, you receive the following error message on
	a blue screen:
	
	  Error Reading CD-ROM in Drive <cd-rom>:
	
	  Please insert CD-ROM
	  With Serial Number <xxxx-xxxx> in Drive <cd-rom>:
	
	  If the CD-ROM is still in the drive, it may require cleaning.
	
	  Press ENTER for OK, or press ESC to Cancel: OK
	
	where <cd-rom> is the drive letter of your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.

	responding (hang).
