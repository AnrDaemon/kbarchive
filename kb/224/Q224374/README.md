	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	When you use Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 99, you may encounter the following
	symptoms:
	
	- Encarta Encyclopedia 99 may start more slowly than you expect.
	
	- Media clips may be played very slowly.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This behavior can occur if a CD-ROM changer is installed in your computer and
	you insert both Encarta Encyclopedia 99 Disc 1 and Disc 2 into the CD-ROM
	changer at the same time.
	
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	To work around these issues, use either of the following methods:
	
	- Insert only one of the Encarta 99 discs in the CD-ROM changer at any given
	  time. When you are prompted to insert the other Encarta Encyclopedia CD-ROM,
	  remove the disc that is currently in the CD-ROM changer before you insert the
	  other Encarta CD-ROM.
	
	- Disable the display of the Home screen when you start Encarta Encyclopedia
	  99. To do this, follow these steps:
	
	  1. Start Encarta Encyclopedia 99.
	
	  2. Click Options, and then click Settings.
	
	  3. Click to clear the "Display Home screen when I start Encarta Encyclopedia"
	     check box.
	
	  4. Quit and then restart Encarta Encyclopedia 99.
