	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	You want to add another user my MSN Explorer, but an error appears stating that
	you have the maximum number of users associated with your MSN Internet Access
	account.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	The MSN Explorer allows up to eight free user accounts to be associated with a
	single paid MSN Internet Access account.
	
	If you have MSN Explorer version 7.0 loaded on several computers and you are the
	"Account Manager" (the sole paid MSN Internet Access account) on the computers,
	the MSN server recognizes each user you add to each computer as one (1) free
	account. And each of these free user accounts get associated with the paying
	account.
	
	For example, if you have two computers, one of which has five free user accounts
	associated, and one of which has three free accounts associated, the registered
	total is eight associated accounts. And because the total is at the limit of
	eight users--even though all of the associated free users do not all reside on
	the same computer--you cannot add any new users to MSN Explorer.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	With MSN Explorer version 7.0, if you remove a user, MSN Explorer disassociates
	any removed accounts from the "Account Manager" account. So you can replace any
	free user account you delete with another free user account.
	
	Note: Even if a free user account is disassociated from the "Account Manager"
	account, the free user account for e-mail and Passport still exists. These types
	of accounts can still sign into MSN Explorer as a "guest", or go to
	www.hotmail.com to view e-mail. These types of users can also can sign into the
	MSN Messenger and access Online Contacts.
