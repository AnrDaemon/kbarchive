	----------------------------------------
	
	On page 6, in the final paragraph of the information box titled "Activating
	Windows XP",
	
	Change:
	"Each copy of Windows XP must be activated within 14 days of the first use."
	
	To:
	"Each copy of Windows XP must be activated within 30 days of the first use."
	
	
	Page 115: My Text File Should Be My Text File.txt
	-------------------------------------------------
	
	In Step 11 on page 115, omitting the .txt file extension will prevent the
	completion of the exercise.
	
	Change:
	"My Text File"
	
	To:
	"My Text File.txt"
	
	
	Quick Reference Card: Keyboard Shortcut For Delete Is Incorrect
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On the Quick Reference card in that back of the book, the keyboard shortcut given
	to delete a selected item is "A". This should be changed to the DEL key.
