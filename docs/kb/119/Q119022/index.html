-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail sent from a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice to a Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks server by means of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC
and AppleTalk Networks may become stuck in the outbound connection gateway queue
on the PC postoffice and be delivered repeatedly to Macintosh server recipients.
This stuck message may also block any gateway traffic queued behind it.

CAUSE
=====

This problem appears mostly in Novell NetWare-based network operating systems.
Its specific cause is still under investigation.

WORKAROUND
==========

Move the PC postoffice to a file server using a different network operating
system. This may remove the problem permanently.

Three short-term workarounds are:

Workaround 1
------------

- Stop and restart the MACGATE.EXE program.

Workaround 2
------------

1. Stop the MACGATE.EXE program.

2. Use the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE)
  to view the connection gateway queue and return or delete the oldest mail
  message in the queue.

3. Restart the MACGATE.EXE program.

Workaround 3
------------

1. Stop the MACGATE.EXE program.

2. Move any mail messages found in the PCTOMAC subdirectory to a temporary
  location.

3. Run MACGATE.EXE again.

4. Move each of the mail messages from the temporary location back to the
  PCTOMAC subdirectory one at a time until the problem message is found.

5. Delete the problem message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: 3.20
