-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The differences in the Return Receipt option in Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
and MS Mail for AppleTalk networks may result in "Mail failure" error messages.

The "Mail Failure" error occurs if an AppleTalk Mail user sends a message to a PC
Mail user with the return-receipt option turned on. If the PC Mail user reads or
deletes the message, the return receipt comes back to the Mac account addressed
from POSTOFFICE. Since it is not a return-receipt message, the AppleTalk Mail
user can reply to it; however, doing so results in a "Mail failure" message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of the difference in functionality between the
AppleTalk and PC Mail systems. On the AppleTalk Mail side, you cannot reply to a
return-receipt message, but in this instance the Mail Connection Gateway creates
the message without labeling it as type "return receipt." As a result, the
AppleTalk Mail user can reply to the message. The reply goes to the user
POSTOFFICE, resulting in the "Mail failure" message.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can avoid the "Mail failure" message by not deleting the message that is
sent from a Macintosh to a PC with a return receipt. Since you may not want to
keep that message around forever, you can delete it and ignore the "Mail
failure" message. You can also avoid using the Return Receipt feature when
mailing to combinations of AppleTalk Mail and PC Mail mailboxes.
