SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Track Changes feature in Microsoft Word, if you click Find or
Replace on the Edit menu and search for specific text, Word may not find the
text specified in the Find what box if that text contains deleted characters.

For example, if you type "Forget me not" (without the quotation marks), turn on
Track Changes, and then delete the word "me", one of the following occurs when
you attempt to do either a Find or a Replace action.

With the "Highlight Changes on Screen" Option Turned On:

Word does not find "Forget not".

With the "Highlight Changes on Screen" Option Turned Off:

When you do a Find action, Word finds "Forget not"; however, when you do a
Replace action, Word does not find "Forget not".

document. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes and click Accept or Reject Changes.
