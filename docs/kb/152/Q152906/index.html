-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 Service Packs 1, 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up or update a Microsoft Exchange Server on a Windows NT Server
that has been configured for dual boot to Windows 95, the following error
messages may be encountered:

  regedit.exe - Ordinal Not Found
  The ordinal 195 could not be located in the dynamic link library SHELL32.DLL

  regedit.exe - Application Error
  The application failed to initialize properly 0xc0000138). Click OK to
  terminate the application.

Setup will finish after the error messages have been cleared and Setup will
report that it finished successfully. However, Setup (or Update, for the Service
Packs) was not able to make the required registry changes and thus the setup is
incomplete.

WORKAROUND
==========

In order to make sure that the appropriate registry entries have been set, run
Setup (or Update) again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These errors will only appear under very specific circumstances, as follows:

- The Exchange Server must be configured to dual boot into both NT and Windows
  95.

- Setup (or Update) must be run through the File Manager.

- Two File Manager windows must be open: one with the Windows95 directory
  selected and another window for the Exchange Server compact disc.

- The errors will only occur the first time attempting to run Setup or Update
  just after booting the Windows NT Server.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
SP1 and SP2. We are researching this problem and will post additional
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
