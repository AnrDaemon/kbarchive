The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 on a computer that has limited hard
disk space, the Information Store (IS) service may stop unexpectedly, and you
may receive the following error message:

  The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service terminated with
  service-specific error 4294966767.

The following entry may appear in the application log:

  Event ID: 1113
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: The log disk is full. Attempting to stop the Microsoft Exchange
  Information Store service.

Also, the following entry may appear in the system log:

  Event ID: 7024
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service terminated with
  service-specific error 4294966767.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the hard disk drive on which transaction log files
are stored lacks adequate space for creation of another log file. (The Mdbdata
folder in X:\Exchsrvr holds these files.)

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run Microsoft Exchange Performance Optimizer to move the
log files to a different hard disk drive. This drive must have enough space to
hold all the existing logs and still allow the Information Store service to
start up.

To work around this issue if you do not have another suitable hard disk drive,
enable circular logging, or add another hard disk drive and then run Performance
Optimizer.

NOTE: When you enable circular logging, you cannot do incremental or differential
backups. Circular logging automatically writes over transaction log files after
the data they contain is committed to the database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the JET database engine detects an 'out of disk space' condition on the
hard disk drive that contains the log file, the following events take place:

- The JET database engine refuses to take any more transactions from the
  Information Store service or the Directory service.

- The information store rolls back all uncommitted transactions (this is done
  through use of the reserved log files Res1.log and Res2.log).

- The information store shuts down, and the JET database engine flushes all
  uncommitted transactions in the log files into the database and leaves the
  databases in a consistent state.

For more information on circular logging, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
