SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to display a README.TXT file at the end of the custom
Setup program for a run-time application developed with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit (ADT).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display a README.TXT file at the end of a run-time application's custom Setup
program, run the Setup Wizard to create the custom Setup as usual, and then
follow these steps:

1. In the Setup Wizard's Executable File Name box, choose the Build button to
  the right of the box, and then select the NOTEPAD.EXE file (this file is
  usually located in the Windows directory).

2. In the Command Line box, enter the following line:

  notepad.exe %s\readme.txt

  NOTE: If the Microsoft Access version 2.0 application will be installed on a
  computer running Windows 95, select EDIT.COM in Step 1 and enter the
  following line in the Command Line box (This only works on Windows 95):

  edit.com %s\readme.txt

  Note that "%s" is a token to provide the application's path. This token is
  case sensitive; "%S" will not work.

3. Clear the "Include Executable File in Distribution Set" check box.

  NOTE: Make sure to clear the "Include Executable File in Distribution Set"
  check box. You are not allowed to ship the NOTEPAD.EXE file with your
  application. Your clients' computers should already have this file. If you
  are concerned that your clients' computers may not have the NOTEPAD.EXE file,
  you should ship a different text editor with your application.

4. Finish the Setup Wizard as usual.
