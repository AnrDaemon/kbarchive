-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Services for NetWare version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You install Directory Services Manager for NetWare (DSMN) on a Windows NT
primary domain controller (PDC) to manage the account database on NetWare
servers centrally from the Windows NT domain.

After you have finished migration, you notice that some groups and users are not
replicated properly. For example, you delete members of a group on a NetWare
server using SYSCON and start a full replication, but the users do not appear in
the member list.

Also, when you run the DSMDUMP utility, you will see that several groups are
missing from the Jet Database. This utility ships with DSMN but is not installed
by default.

You will receive the following error in the application event log:

  Event ID 8005
  MSSYNC

  The Sync Agent Service change log thread failed to find the last change
  log entry it processed. Some user and group modifications might be lost.

CAUSE
=====

Although DSMN detects that it has missed some changes to the Security Accounts
Database (SAM), it currently only logs this event.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the problem, set ChangeLogSize to the maximum value.


There are workarounds available after the problem already exists.

- Re-create the affected groups. To do this:

  1. Remove all NetWare Servers from DSMN so the NetWare object IDs are
     retained later.

  2. Select the group in User Manager for Domains and press F8 to create a copy
     of the original group.

  3. Enter a name for the new temporary group.

  4. Delete the original group.

  5. Select the temporary group and press F8 again.

  6. Enter the name of the original group and press ENTER.

  7. Repeat the above steps for any groups missing in the output of DSMDUMP.

  8. Add the NetWare servers in Synchronization Manager; do not migrate user
     accounts.

- Reinstalling DSMN

This may be easier for you if you only have a few NetWare Servers. The main
problem here is that you lose the NetWare password settings if you don't have
FPNW running on the server. To prevent password changes in the Windows NT domain
while DSMN is not running it might be a good idea to set Netlogon to Manual
startup and to stop it before removing DSMN. After you reinstalled DSMN, add the
NetWare server without migrating the accounts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
