-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can use Application Security (Appsec.exe) to limit which programs can be run
by users on a Terminal Server. A default list of programs is included to allow
users to successfully log on to the server. You can add other programs to the
list to restrict user activity. After an improper system shutdown, this list may
not be read correctly from the registry and memory may contain an incomplete
list of programs. Therefore, users who could log on or run certain programs
earlier may not be able to because the list is incomplete.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
