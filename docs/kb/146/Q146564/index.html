-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You might receive the following error message either when starting a Microsoft
Exchange client or after receiving a new message that a rule attempts to
process.

  Title : Rules in Error
  Rule
  Subject:xxxMOVE TO:&lt;unavailable&gt;
  Error:
  Failed to perform client side action

CAUSE
=====

The Personal Folder is password protected and the proper password has not been
entered. This problem can occur under two circumstances:

- Assume you quit from Microsoft Exchange and a personal folder has the focus.
  The next time you start Microsoft Exchange, you are prompted for the password
  immediately. In this case, the rule can find the folder and processes
  correctly.

  If, however, when you quit Microsoft Exchange, the Mailbox has focus (instead
  of a personal folder), the rule tries to process before knowing the password
  to the personal folder and the "Rules in error" message appears. Any mail
  messages that were to be copied to the personal folder, will instead appear
  in the Inbox of the Mailbox.

- You cancel a personal folder password dialog without typing the password
  during startup of the Microsoft Exchange client, and a message is received
  (at any point) that the Inbox Assistant attempts to process (copy or move) to
  that personal folder. Because the personal folder cannot be opened, the rule
  cannot be processed.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you exit Microsoft Exchange, place focus on a personal folder (not the
Mailbox).

When you start Microsoft Exchange, enter the password for (any) personal folders
involved with rules processing.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of the Microsoft
Exchange clients for Windows 3.x and Windows NT. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
