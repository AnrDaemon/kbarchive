Last Modified: 13-JUN-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Exchange Server client and you choose to reinstall
Microsoft Exchange, The Microsoft Network, or Microsoft Fax during a custom
Windows 95 installation, Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0 may no longer work properly and
many of the menu items for the Microsoft Exchange Server client may no longer
appear.

CAUSE
=====

When you reinstall the Microsoft Exchange client that is included with Windows
95, The Microsoft Network, or Microsoft Fax, the Microsoft Exchange Server
client files are overwritten. The Microsoft Exchange client that is included
with Windows 95 does not include the advanced features of the Microsoft Exchange
Server client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve these problems, reinstall the Microsoft Exchange Server client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When this situation occurs, the following menu items no longer appear:

  File     Add to Favorites
  Tools    Synchronize
           All folders
           This Folder
           Download Address Book
           Inbox Assistant
           Out of Office Assistant
           Application Design
           Folder Designer
           Copy Folder Design
           Folder Design Cue Cards
  Compose  New Form

Note that some portions of the Inbox Assistant may still function (such as moving
mail to folders other than the Inbox), but there is no way to alter this
behavior without reinstalling the Microsoft Exchange Server client. If you made
changes to the default fonts, such as the font used to reply to mail, you must
reconfigure your preferences.
