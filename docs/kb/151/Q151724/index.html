SYMPTOMS
========

When a delegate on a manager's Appointment Book creates a meeting, the meeting
will show the delegate as the Organizer; however, the Edit Appointment dialog
box will show the manager.


CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

The person who has the original appointment on his or her schedule is the owner,
not the person who sent the mail. The delegate is acting on behalf of the
manager as a "virtual manager."

MORE INFORMATION
================

No one invited is aware that the appointment was organized by the delegate. On
the original invitation sent by the delegate is the following:

  Sending on behalf of USERX.

where userx is the manager.

However, this is not sent to the invitees. The meeting responses are received by
the delegate only and contain the following:

  Received on behalf of USERX.

Additional query words: 7.00 schedule plus
