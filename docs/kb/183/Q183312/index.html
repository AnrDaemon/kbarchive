-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate a user from Microsoft Mail to Microsoft Exchange Server using
the Exchange Migration wizard, and a custom recipient for the user being
migrated already exists, the following event may be logged and the user's data
may not be migrated properly:

  Event ID:      7026
  Source:        MSExchangeMig
  Type:          Error
  Category:      None
  Description:   Migration Aborted due to Mapi logon failure.

CAUSE
=====

When a user is migrated from Microsoft Mail to Exchange Server and a custom
recipient is found with the same "MS" proxy address, that custom recipient is
converted to an Exchange Server mailbox to preserve proxy addresses.

Through this code path, "MIGRATE" proxy is not created.

The "MIGRATE" proxy is used to find the mailbox when migrating the user's
information (schedule information, e-mail, and so on).

RESOLUTION
==========

The Exchange Migration wizard now searches for the "MS" proxy as well as the
"MIGRATE" proxy to find the mailbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):
