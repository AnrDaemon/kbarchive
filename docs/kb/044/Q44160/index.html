Question:

I have a very large QuickC Version 2.00 program that is too big to
debug in the QuickC 2.00 environment. How can I debug part of my
program without including debug information for the whole application?

Response:

QuickC 2.00 does not give you the option to turn debug information on
or off for single modules; however, there are ways to trick QuickC
2.00 into compiling part of the application without debug information.

By turning off the debug information, you can recompile some of the
modules without debug information. When you are ready to run the
application, turn debugging back on and recompile the changed modules.
You must shell out to DOS at this point to delete the old executable
file, which will force QuickC to relink before running. When you
select RUN, QuickC will ask if you want to rebuild. If you select yes,
all of the modules will be recompiled. If you select no, QuickC will
link only the existing object files before executing the program.

Note: To turn off debug information, go to the Options-Make menu and
select the release flags. Do not try to turn off debugging information
by selecting line numbers only in the compiler flags.
