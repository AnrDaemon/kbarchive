Question: What is Quick Assembler?

Quick Assembler is, simply put, QuickC 2.00 with the addition of a
Quick Assembler which is completely functional within the Quick
environment. You can edit, assemble, and debug pure assembly programs
with the benefit of Online Assembly Help. It also is designed to make
mixed-language programming even easier and faster than before.

This package has all the capabilities of QuickC 2.00 with the added
performance enhancement of a full assembler.

Quick Assembler does NOT replace the Inline Assembler. It is a full
assembler which supports pure assembly source. The Inline Assembler is
still available as a feature of QuickC.

Quick Assembler is NOT a stand-alone package. It is bundled with
specific QuickC 2.01 packages. There is a fulfillment package for
owners of QuickC 2.00 which allows the upgrading to QuickC/Quick
Assembler.
