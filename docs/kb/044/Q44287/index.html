Consider the following sequence of events:

1. You are debugging a program named FILE.C in the QuickC environment.

2. A line is marked as a breakpoint (by pressing F9 or using the
   Debug.Breakpoint dialog box).

3. That line is deleted (by pressing CTRL+Y for example).

4. The program is rebuilt and re-executed (by pressing F5).

   At this point, the following pop-up is displayed:

      Cannot set breakpoint
             file.c:0

To get past this point, you must remove this mysterious breakpoint
through the dialog box selected with the Debug.Breakpoint menu option.
Using this dialog box, remove all breakpoints with a line of zero. The
program may then be executed successfully.

To avoid this problem altogether, do not delete a line that is a
breakpoint. Instead, toggle the breakpoint off by pressing F9 on the
breakpoint prior to deleting that line.

This problem is caused because when a breakpoint line is deleted, the
associated breakpoint entry is not deleted. Rather, its line number is
set to zero. There is no line zero that the debugger can set a
breakpoint on; thus, the error pop-up occurs.
