The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After creating a Windows CE project, Handheld PC version 2.0 and/or Palm-size PC
version 2.01 are available as Windows CE configurations, but no configurations
are available for Windows CE versions 2.1 and 2.11. The product description
states that these operating systems are supported.

CAUSE
=====

To develop for a specific Windows CE platform requires that the corresponding
Windows CE Platform SDK be installed. The Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0
includes the Platform SDK for Handheld PC and Palm-size PC.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the Microsoft Windows CE Web site downloads section for the latest Windows
CE Platform SDK updates: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsce

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When building Windows CE applications using the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual
C++, the following considerations must be made when targeting a device:

- CPU: This dictates the type of machine code that must be generated by the
  compiler. Examples of processors are MIPS, SH3, SH4, ARM, and x86.

- Operating System Version: The behavior of the core operating system
  components may change with each version of Windows CE operating system. As a
  result, each version of the operating system has its own build tools
  (compiler, linker, remote tools, and so on). Examples of operating system
  versions are Windows CE versions 1.0, 1.01, 2.0, 2.01, 2.1, and 2.11.

- Platform: Each device that uses Windows CE also uses different configurations
  of the core Windows CE operating system components. For example, some devices
  have a display, keyboard, and mouse, while other devices may not have any
  form of user input. The platform signifies a particular configuration of
  components. Current standard platforms are:

   - Handheld PC

   - Palm-size PC

   - Auto PC

   - Handheld PC Professional Edition

   - Color Palm-size PC

  To develop applications, the development environment must have some way of
  knowing which Windows CE operating system components are available on the
  particular platform being targeted. This is accomplished by installing a
  Windows CE Platform SDK. The SDK provides the headers, libraries, and
  additional tools (for example, emulation and samples) necessary for
  development on the respective platform.

  In the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0, the available Windows CE
  platforms can be viewed in a project by clicking Select Active WCE
  Configuration on the Build menu of Developer Studio. The toolkit ships with
  Platform SDKs for only the Handheld PC and Palm-size PC.
