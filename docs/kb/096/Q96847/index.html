SUMMARY
=======


1. Q. How can I repartition my hard disk into one large partition?

  A. Changing your hard disk from multiple partitions to a single partition
  involves backing up your data files, repartitioning your hard disk, and then
  restoring your data files. To do this, you must use the Fdisk program. The
  section titled "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" on pages 204-216 of
  the "Microsoft MS-DOS 6 User's Guide" contains instructions for
  repartitioning your hard disk. For specific instructions about backing up
  your data, repartitioning your hard disk, and restoring your data files,
  order Application Note PD0771, "Installation and Partitioning Sequence
  Questions &amp; Answers," from Microsoft Product Support Services.

2. Q. When I try to use DoubleSpace to compress drives, I receive the error
  "Cannot load SMARTDrive with DoubleSpace." How can I correct this problem?

  A. DoubleSpace is incompatible with versions of SMARTDrive earlier than
  version 4.1. If you are using an earlier version of SMARTDrive, DoubleSpace
  displays this error message. To correct this problem, make sure you are
  loading SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.1, which is included with MS-DOS 6.0.

3. Q. I have a hard disk with more than 1024 cylinders. Is there a way to access
  and use the entire hard disk?

  A. The MS-DOS 6 Upgrade uses the hardware BIOS to read and write to the hard
  disk drive. Due to the limitations of the standard ROM BIOS, MS-DOS accesses
  only the first 1024 cylinders of a physical hard disk. If you have formatted
  your hard disk after upgrading to MS-DOS 6 and the disk has less space
  available, consult your hardware manual or contact your hardware manufacturer
  for more information.

4. Q. When I run the Fdisk program, it does not recognize all the disk space on
  my hard disk. What is causing this problem?

  A. Fdisk relies on the BIOS to report the hard disk size. If Fdisk incorrectly
  reports that your hard disk is smaller than it actually is, either your BIOS
  is set for the wrong drive type (that is, it is set incorrectly or it does
  not support your specific drive's dimensions), or your drive has more than
  1024 cylinders.

  Contact your hardware manufacturer to determine if your BIOS is set correctly.
  If it is not, correcting the setting should allow Fdisk to recognize the
  entire hard disk. If your BIOS does not support your drive type, and your
  hard disk doesn't exceed 1024 cylinders, you may need to order a new BIOS
  from your hardware manufacturer. For more information, contact your hardware
  manufacturer.
