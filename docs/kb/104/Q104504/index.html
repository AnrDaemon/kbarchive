SYMPTOMS
========

An OS/2 LAN Manager server can freeze or stop responding during high stress
situations if it receives an asynchronous "close" request from a Windows for
Workgroups workstation immediately followed by another request on the same file
from the same machine. All network activity can cease as well as all
keyboard/mouse access to the console.

CAUSE
=====

In certain instances Windows for Workgroups does not wait for a response from an
SMBClose request to the server. This normally is not a problem, but if the Close
has not finished and another operation (open, delete or rename) is requested on
the same file, the OS/2 LAN Manager server may freeze as it attempts to perform
both operations on the file "at the same time."

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 addresses this issue. The Windows for
Workgroups development team has also created a site specific fix to version 3.1
for those sites where upgrading is not an option.
