SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the Routing Wizard, you may receive the following
error message:

  The Route Map was successfully installed but won't run until a Route Agent is
  installed.

The following error message then appears:

  The handler assigned to this agent is not present on this server, your agent
  will not run until an administrator installs it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, check the following issues:

- Make certain that the Event Service is installed on both the server that
  contains the user's mailbox and the server that contains the folder to be
  routed.

- Make certain that the mailbox that creates the folder to be routed has Owner
  permissions on eventConfig_&lt;servername&gt;.

- View the following log file to determine the status of the Event Service
  installation:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Exchange Routing Wizard\St5unst.log"
  (without the quotation marks)

If the Event Service is not properly installed, reinstall the Event Service from
the Exchange Server 5.5 compact disc, and then reapply the relevant service
pack.
