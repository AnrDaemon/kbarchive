The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Systems Management Server (SMS) inventories a 16-bit client, the Network
card MAC address or NetCard ID will not be reported if direct hosted IPX is the
only protocol installed on the client. Adding another protocol that uses NetBIOS
or adding NetBIOS support to the IPX stack will allow the network card MAC
address to be reported normally.

CAUSE
=====

Currently, SMS will identify the 16-bit client is either a Microsoft or a
NetWare client. If it is determined that the system in question is a Microsoft
client, a NetBIOS "GET_ADAPT_STATUS" call is issued to return the network card
information, including the network card MAC address. When a direct hosted IPX
stack is installed, the NetBIOS layer is not installed and this call fails.
Subsequently, the MAC address is not reported to the SMS database.

Because Windows 95 installs IPX as a default protocol, with direct hosting
enabled, the default client configuration will not report the MAC address.
Adding any additional protocol that supports the NetBIOS interface allows the
MAC address to be reported to the SMS database.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do one of the following:

- Install NetBIOS support for IPX.

-or-

- Add a second protocol stack that has a NetBIOS interface.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
