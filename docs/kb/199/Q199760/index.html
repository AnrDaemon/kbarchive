SUMMARY
=======

When a user receives the temporary key and tries to re-enroll in advanced
security, they are asked for a password. If the user doesn't supply a password,
they are not re-enrolled in advanced security.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This occurs because during the original enrollment, the user chose high security
associated with their private key. This prompts the user for a keyset name and
password. Anytime the user needs to send, read, or re-enroll in advanced
security, they must supply this password.

If the user forgets this password, to have them successfully re-enroll in
advanced security, follow these steps:

1. Recover their security key and send the temporary key to them.

2. In the client, on the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Security tab.
  Click Get digital ID, click "Set up security for me on Exchange Server", and
  then click OK.

3. You are prompted for a token and keyset name. In Keyset Name, change this
  from the default.

4. A message is sent to the server and a reply from the security authority will
  be received.

5. Double-click the message, the user is prompted to select their security
  level. If they want High security, select "Create new password for this
  item". In Password for, insert the keyset name changed in step 3. Enter the
  password for the new keyset name and private key.
