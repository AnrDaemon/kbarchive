SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a network adapter on a multihomed h-node host to query
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS), another network adapter without this
configuration may appear to follow the h-node type name resolution method
correctly.

NetBT sends a name query to WINS from the network adapter that is configured to
query WINS, but almost immediately sends a name query broadcast from the network
adapter that is not configured to query WINS. The nonconfigured network adapter
does not wait for WINS name resolution to be unsuccessful.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because a multihomed computer places calls on all adapters
to which NetBT is bound, and each adapter works independently to resolve the
name and to make a connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use an Lmhosts file to preload entries in the NetBIOS
cache table. This cache is checked first before the host queries WINS or sends a
broadcast.

You can also configure the host to use p-node so that it uses only WINS and never
broadcasts.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NetBT node type determines what method NetBT uses to register and resolve
names. An h-node system queries the name server first, and then broadcasts.

Typically, all adapters in an h-node type host are configured to use WINS.
