Product(s): Microsoft Exchange

Keyword(s): exc55sp2 exc55sp3
Last Modified: 24-SEP-1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Calendar Connector does not return free and busy information for SMTP custom
recipients. However, Exchange Server users may be able to make a free and busy
query by means of the InterOrg Public Folder-Free/Busy replication utility.


CAUSE
=====

The Calendar Connector does not recognize free and busy transactions for SMTP
custom recipients because it does not have a designated Calendar provider. The
Calendar Connector has only three built-in calendaring providers, Lotus Notes,
Novell GroupWise, and IBM OV/VM. You may also see the following error messages
in the event log:

  Source:MSExchangeCalCon
  Type:Information
  Event:6001
  Description:The description for Event ID ( 6001 ) in Source ( MSExchangeCalCon
  ) could not be found. It contains the following insertion string(s): No
  Provider Found.

  Source:MSExchangeCalCon
  Type:Information
  Event:6001
  Description:The description for Event ID ( 6001 ) in Source ( MSExchangeCalCon
  ) could not be found. It contains the following insertion string(s):
  HrProcessNextTransaction Failed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft Exchange or Outlook clients do not have the same limitation. The
InterOrg Public Folder Replication tool is designed to work with MAPI clients
only.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on the Calendar Connector, refer to the Calcon.rtf
documentation file located in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Calcon\Doc folder after
connector installation.
