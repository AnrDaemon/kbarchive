The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook Web Access Service Pack 1 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you use Outlook Web Access with the "Use Schedule+ as my primary calendar"
option, an appointment is created with "show time as Out of Office" or "Free."
When you view the appointment details from Outlook Web Access, the appointment
is displayed as Busy or Tentative regardless of the setting you chose.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Outlook Web Access client with the "Use Schedule+ as my primary
calendar" option, the Outlook Web Access client is only capable of displaying
times as Busy or Tentative. When Outlook Web Access is used in this mode, only
the options that are supported by the Schedule+ client are available. The Free
and Out of Office settings are allowed when the "Use Schedule+ as my primary
calendar" option is not being used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Outlook Web Access, the choices for an appointment's "show time as" are Free,
Tentative, Busy, and Out of Office. In Schedule+ the choices for an appointment
are Private, Tentative, and Busy.

Creating an appointment using the Schedule+ client and a setting of Private will
always be displayed as Busy in Outlook Web Access client. Creating an
appointment in Outlook Web Access with a setting of Free or Tentative will
display as Tentative, and a setting of Busy or Out of Office will display as
Tentative.
