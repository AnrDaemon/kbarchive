-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service is configured to use the UUENCODE
encoding method, and the message is correctly encoded in the configured
character set. However, a double-byte character set (DBCS) attachment file name
is always encoded with Shift-JIS, even if JIS or EUC is specified as the
character set translation.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange 4.0 Internet Mail was used to encode all file names into the configured
character set. The behavior was changed for Exchange 5.0 and 5.5, due to
interoperability problems with other messaging clients. Those messaging clients
apparently have changed their behavior, so a hotfix has been created for 5.0 and
5.5 that change them to behave like 4.0.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you

This fix has been posted to the following Internet location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Exchg5.0/Post-SP2-STORE/




Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.
