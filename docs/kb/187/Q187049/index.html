The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

To open active sessions without clients connected to them: Start as many
connections you want, and do nothing in your connections (no clock in taskbar).
Minimize all your clients and switch off your client computer (to simulate a
power outage). Now, restart your client computer. All of your lost connections
will be reported as active by Terminal Server.

This behavior is also observed when the Win16 client stops responding (hangs) in
stress. The connection is no longer active. Yet, the server does not detect the
loss of the connection. The session remains active and, thereby, does not allow
a reconnect.


CAUSE
=====

Expected behavior is that the session should change from an active to a
disconnected status when the server no longer receives acknowledgement of packet
receipt from the client. With the NetBEUI or IPX/SPX protocols, there are
watchdog packets that get sent periodically. When these fail, they will mark the
session as disconnected. TCP has a similar concept (KeepAlive packets). However,
these are not used for several reasons. This includes the fact that the
connection may be across a WAN link which may or may not always be up. In fact,
in the case of a WAN link that is brought up on demand use of the KeepAlive
packets might cause the link to be brought up and down when it is not really
needed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
