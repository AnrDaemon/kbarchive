The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If a server is removed from a site with the Event Service running and then
reinstalled in the site, duplicate copies of a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
EventConfig public folder may appear in the Events Root folder. These ghosted
folder copies cannot be deleted through raw properties in the Exchange Server
Administrator program and must be deleted using the command line utility
Events.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you start the Exchange Server Setup program and select Remove All with the
Event Service running, the server you are removing will appear in the drop-down
lists of servers in the Exchange Server Administrator program. This happens when
the deletion of the server's corresponding EventConfig public folder is not
replicated to other servers before the process of removing the server is
completed. When you reinstall the server in the site, duplicate or ghosted
EventConfig_&lt;ServerName&gt; folders will appear in the Events Root folder
beneath the Systems Folder in the Exchange Server Administrator program.

If this happens, removal of the server's second EventConfig folder can be
accomplished by completing the following steps:

1. In Microsoft Windows NT, click Start, point to Programs, and then select
  Command Prompt to open a command window.

2. From the Command Prompt, type "net stop MSExchangeES" (without the quotation
  marks) to stop the Exchange Server Event service.

3. In the Exchsrvr\Bin directory (or the directory where Microsoft Exchange
  Server is installed), run Events.exe /c:&lt;ServerName&gt;, (where
  &lt;ServerName&gt; is the name of the server that has the duplicate
  EventConfig folders). The command /c indicates cleanup mode. This removes the
  EventConfig folder from the folder hierarchy so that the server no longer
  appears in the Events Root folder.

  NOTE: When you run Events.exe, the account you are logged on as must be the
  service account, otherwise, a MAPI error is returned. Also note that each
  time you run the events /c command, it removes only one folder. So, if you
  have 4 event config folders for a particular server, you need to run the
  command a total of four times to get rid of all of the folders.

4. Restart the Event Service by typing "net start MSExchangeES" (without the
  quotation marks).

5. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, press the F5 key to
  refresh the screen. The duplicate folders should no longer appear.
