SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5) includes an updated Streaming SIMD
Extensions driver. The Streaming SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple
Data)Extensions driver provides transparent, user-mode support for saving and
restoring the Streaming SIMD Extensions register state in Windows NT 4.0 SP5.
This driver enables programs to use the extended register set required by some
of the Streaming SIMD Extensions. The driver provides support for all Intel
Architecture processor families that support the Streaming SIMD Extensions. The
Streaming SIMD Extensions driver runs on personal computers that are based on
Intel Architecture processors supporting the Streaming SIMD Extensions and run
Windows NT 4.0 SP5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Streaming SIMD Extensions driver provides error-related information in
Windows NT Event Viewer. This section contains the error message descriptions in
the event log and the details needed to understand the error message and take
corrective action.

Error Message Description
-------------------------

- The driver did not enable Streaming SIMD Extensions support as floating point
  emulation is enabled.

  The Streaming SIMD Extensions driver does not enable Streaming SIMD Extensions
  support in the operating system if floating-point emulation has been enabled.
  To turn off floating-point emulation in Windows NT 4.0 SP5, run the "pentnt
  -o" (without the quotation marks) command and then reboot the computer.

- Not all processors in the system support the Streaming SIMD Extensions.

  The Streaming SIMD Extensions driver did not enable Streaming SIMD Extensions
  support in the operating system because all processors in the computer do not
  support Streaming SIMD Extensions.

- The driver was unable to allocate memory.

  The Streaming SIMD Extensions driver was unable to allocate required memory
  and did not enable Streaming SIMD Extensions support in the operating system.

- The driver failed to register required notify routines.

  The Streaming SIMD Extensions driver did not enable Streaming SIMD Extensions
  support in the operating system because it could not register required
  routines.

- The driver failed to hook required handler.

  The Streaming SIMD Extensions driver did not enable Streaming SIMD Extensions
  support in the operating system because of an internal error.

For information about obtaining Windows NT 4.0 SP5, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NOTE: What are Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions?

Streaming SIMD Extensions is a new set of instructions that will be supported by
future Intel processors beginning with the Pentium III processor. Single
Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) extensions significantly accelerate performance
of 3D graphics. Besides 3D graphics improvements, the extensions also include
additional integer and cacheability instructions that improve other aspects of
performance.

Any errors seen on a production server shouldn't be a major problem; simply
DISABLE the INTLFXSR service and reboot.
