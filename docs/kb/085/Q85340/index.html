SUMMARY
=======

The fax board used by the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax controls the
asynchronous connection and the communication with the remote fax machine.

Faxes are placed in the fax board queue by the gateway. The board dials and
connects to the remote fax machine, and handles actual transmission of the
message. Any errors encountered by the fax board are passed back to the gateway,
usually identified by a "Communication Error."

The fax board also accepts incoming calls from fax machines, receives transmitted
faxes, and passes the received messages to the gateway.

Fax boards should be tested before running the fax gateway by sending and
receiving faxes using the fax software that was shipped with the board.
