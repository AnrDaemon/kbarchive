SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to use certain command-line arguments on the running of
WINHELP.EXE to go immediately to areas of the help file other than the contents.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When calling WINHELP.EXE, but before specifying the help file name, use the
following switches:

   -k  Go to keyword (set up with the K footnote within the help file).

  -n  Go to context number (set up with the # footnote within the help
      file).

  -i  Go to context ID (set up with the # footnote within the help file
      using a #defined string).

  -h  Run WINHELP.EXE with the WINHELP.HLP file (no other help file is
      necessary).


EXAMPLES
--------

The following examples can be tested by typing them into the Run dialog box that
opens when you choose Run from the File menu in the Program Manager.

To run the file MYHELP.HLP and jump to the keyword "jumphere", type the
following:

  " WINHELP.EXE -kjumphere myhelp.hlp" (without the quotation marks)

To run the file TEST.HLP and jump to the topic with context ID number 101, type
the following:

  " WINHELP.EXE -n101 test.hlp" (without the quotation marks)

To run the file CIJUMP.HLP and jump to the topic with context ID "MY_JUMPID"
(which had previously been set within the .HLP file with #define MY_JUMPID 102),
type the following:

  " WINHELP.EXE -iMY_JUMPID cijump.hlp" (without the quotation marks)

To run the file "Help on Help", type the following:

  " WINHELP.EXE -h" (without the quotation marks)
