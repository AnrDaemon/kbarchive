-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During installation of Microsoft At Work PC Fax on a Class 2.0 fax modem, the
following error message is displayed:

  Cannot find AWCL2_0.DLL

If you choose Ignore, the installation process continues, but Microsoft At Work
PC Fax is disabled.

If you choose the Fax and Mail options during the Microsoft At Work PC Fax
installation process, this error message also appears when you enter Windows for
Workgroups Mail.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs because Microsoft At Work PC Fax does not provide
support for Class 2.0 fax modems. "Class 2.0" fax modems are not the same as
"Class 2" fax modems, which are supported under Microsoft At Work PC Fax. During
installation of Microsoft At Work PC Fax, the fax modem class is detected and
the correct dynamic link library for that fax modem class is loaded:

  AWCAS.DLL    = CAS fax modem detected
  AWCLASS1.DLL = Class 1 fax modem detected
  AWCLASS2.DLL = Class 2 fax modem detected

If Microsoft At Work PC Fax asks for AWCL2_0.DLL, the fax modem has been
identified as a Class 2.0 fax modem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Type "AT+FCLASS=?" (without the quotation marks) in Windows for Workgroups
Terminal to determine if additional fax modem classes are supported by the fax
modem.

- If the fax modem reports only 2.0, it is not possible to run Microsoft At
  Work PC Fax on this fax modem. No workarounds are available.

- If the fax modem reports it is also Class 1 compatible, you can enable the
  fax modem by editing the FIXMODEMCLASS= line in the [COMn] section of the
  EXFAXPUMP.INI file to read:

  FIXMODEMCLASS=1.
