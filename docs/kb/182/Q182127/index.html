-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When your computer restarts for the first time after you install Windows 95,
your computer may seem to stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if your computer has a VoiceView modem installed. The files
needed to install this modem may cause multiple instances of the Grpconv.exe
program to start, which may make your computer appear to hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use the appropriate method:

Allow Setup to Finish
---------------------

Although your computer may seem to be hung, it is not, and you should allow Setup
to continue until it is finished. Note that you may experience a longer than
normal installation time.

Edit the Mdmvv.inf File
-----------------------

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

If you are a System Administrator who wants to run an unattended Setup, you can
edit the Mdmvv.inf file, and then run Setup again. To do so, use the following
steps:

1. Right-click the Mdmvv.inf file, and then click Open.

2. In the [VoiceView_Modem] section, place a semi-colon in front of the
  following line:

  HKR,, Runonce,,"grpconv /o" line.

3. On the File menu, click Save, quit the program you used to edit the Mdmvv.inf
  file, and then run Setup again.
