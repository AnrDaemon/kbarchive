CodeView version 3.00 and Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.00
have problems recognizing the built-in monitor of IBM P70 portables
under OS/2. Symptoms of this problem include the following error
messages:

   Product     Error Message
   -------     -------------

   CodeView    Internal Debugger Error 0 at load time
   PWB         Inability to change from 43-line mode

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CodeView version
3.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.

This problem is directly related to the video configuration of the IBM
P70. In its documentation, IBM mentions briefly that it might be
necessary to type MODE CO80 to make some software recognize the
built-in plasma display. An added condition for PWB and CodeView is
the necessity of being in 43-line mode. PWB automatically places you
in 43-line mode no matter what you previous mode was and thus gets
around this limitation. If you attempts to change the height switch
while editing, PWB doesn't complain but still stays in 43-line mode.

CodeView cannot make the mode change in the same way that PWB can. If
invoked without the above considerations, CodeView will crash with an
Internal Debugger Error 0. The following are several ways to work
around this problem if want to use CodeView with this type of
configuration.

1. Type MODE CO80 or BW80 and invoke CodeView with the /43 switch.

2. Type MODE CO80,43 or BW80,43 before invoking CodeView.

3. Use an external monitor with the built-in VGA port.

4. Invoke CodeView from PWB, which makes the change automatically.
