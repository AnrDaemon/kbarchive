SUMMARY
=======

When you restore the directory to a computer, directory objects not included in
the restored directory are repopulated with updated entries by other servers in
the organization. This includes the latest objects or entries that originated
from the restored server, that were not on the backup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This process is called backsyncing. When the directory is restored from backup,
a special flag is set in the registry which tells the directory to start
backsyncing. At this point, the restored directory contacts all the other
directories it is aware of and requests for replication updates starting at
zero, but with the "backsync" flag set. This causes the other directories to
search their databases for all objects that were sent by the requesting
directory.

For example, if you create UserA on Server1, the object for UserA replicates out
to other sites. If Server1 goes down, and you restore from a backup that was
done before UserA was created, Server1 will backsync and will get the UserA
object back from a server which it replicates the object to. This is not limited
to the local site; Server1 may receive this object from another site.

Note: The updates will not be sent from another site if a "delete" has been
issued for the Directory Replication connector or the object(s).
