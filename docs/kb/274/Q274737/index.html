SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to verify that changes that occur when you run the
commands setup /forestprep and setup /domainprep have been replicated throughout
the forest or domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following Microsoft Knowledge Base article outlines the procedure for
upgrading from Exchange 2000 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) to Release to
Manufacturing (RTM) code:

  Q272082 XADM: How to Upgrade from Exchange 2000 RC2 to RTM

After the instructions that describe how to run setup /forestprep and setup
/domainprep, Knowledge Base article Q272082 contains the following information:

  "Wait for the new schema changes to be replicated throughout your forest.
  This can take an extended period of time depending on the complexity of your
  Active Directory deployment. Because of the schema updates made during
  ForestPrep, your global catalogs will also be rebuilt at this time."

  -and-

  "Wait for the DomainPrep changes to be replicated throughout your domain."

ForestPrep
----------

WARNING: If you use the ADSI Edit snap-in, the LDP utility, or any other LDAP
version 3 client, and you incorrectly modify the attributes of Active Directory
objects, you can cause serious problems. These problems may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server, or
both. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that occur if you incorrectly
modify Active Directory object attributes can be solved. Modify these attributes
at your own risk.

To verify that the changes from setup /forestprep have been replicated throughout
the forest, use either of the following methods:

- Look for event ID 1575 in the directory event log on each domain controller.

  -or-

- Follow these steps:

  1. Start the ADSI Edit snap-in that is located in &lt;root&gt;/Program
     Files/Support Tools.

     NOTE: Before you start the ADSI Edit snap-in, you must first manually
     register Adsiedit.dll after you run Setup.exe from the Support\Tools
     folder on the Windows 2000 CD-ROM.

  2. Navigate to Schema and look for the following entry:
     cn=ms-Exch-Schema-Version-Pt.

  3. In the "Select a property to view" box, click rangeUpper and type the
     value "4397" (without the quotation marks). Any value that is less than
     4397 represents an earlier version of Exchange 2000.

DomainPrep
----------

To verify that setup /domainprep has completed, run the Policytest utility on the
domain controller. This utility is found in the Support/Utils/&lt;platform&gt;
folder on the Exchange 2000 Server Enterprise Edition CD-ROM. When you run this
utility from a command prompt, all domain controllers report with the same
security settings.
