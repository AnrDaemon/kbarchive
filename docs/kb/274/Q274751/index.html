The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After logging on to Novell NetWare, and running the Systems Management Server
(SMS) script, clients may lose any mapped drives that the logon script may have
established. This behavior can occur if you configured SMS to use Novell NetWare
4.x or 5.x servers as Bindery servers (Bindery Emulation), and the users log on
to NetWare by using NetWare Directory Services (NDS) connections.

CAUSE
=====

The network abstraction layer (NAL) on the client makes a Bindery connection to
the Bindery Client Access Point (CAP) because it does not recognize any existing
Bindery connection. This is because the client has an NDS connection to the
tree. NAL then detaches from the CAP when it is finished, and this logs the user
off of the tree.

NAL operates in a manner specific to the type of network operating systems (NOS).
It is not possible to support a situation where a client logs in under NDS, but
makes a Bindery connection to an SMS system role (Logon Point, Distribution
Point, and CAP).

The same problem would arise if you configured SMS to create NDS-based system
roles, and the clients authenticate by using a Bindery connection.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps to make sure that the
NetWare-based SMS system roles match that of the client connection type:

- Switch the client redirector to authenticate in the same manner in which SMS
  created the NetWare server role. Microsoft recommends that you have the CAP
  in the same container, depending on which version of redirector is being
  used.

  -or-

- When creating the NetWare-based SMS server role (Logon Point, Distribution
  Point, CAP), make sure to add it as the same connection type that the clients
  will be using to connect to that NetWare resource. For example, if the
  clients log on and authenticate to a NetWare 4.x or 5.x tree as an NDS
  connection, configure SMS to only create NDS system roles, and not Bindery
  system roles.
