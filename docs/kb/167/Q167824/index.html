SUMMARY
=======

In planner view in Microsoft Schedule+, the busy times for resources are based
on a different logical interpretation than the busy times for required or
optional attendees. That is, the planner will display as busy (or not available)
only if ALL resources are busy while meeting attendees will show as busy when
ANY of the attendees are busy.

There are four methods for viewing the individual busy resources:

1. Resources that are busy during the selected meeting interval will display a
  red X next to their name in the attendees list.

2. Double click the selected meeting time to show individual attendees and
  resources that are busy during that time.

3. Secondary click on the selected meeting time to show individual attendees and
  resources that are busy during that time.

4. Choosing the Request Meeting button will bring up a dialog if multiple
  resources are available allowing the user to select one or more resources for
  the meeting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Microsoft Schedule+ generates the busy times for resources, it constructs a
query using the "and" operator. For example, Schedule+ constructs a query such
as "if resource A AND resource B are busy," show the indicators for the busy
times.

In contrast, when Microsoft Schedule+ generates the busy times for required or
optional attendees, it constructs a query using the "or" operator. For example,
it constructs a query such as "if required attendee A OR required attendee B is
busy," show the indicators for the busy times.

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: WINNT WIN16 WIN95 XCLN XSCH KBUSAGE
