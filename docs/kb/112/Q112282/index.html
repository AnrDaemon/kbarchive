The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+, a Monthly View of a calendar of
appointments can be printed. Due to the print algorithm it can appear that the
appointment information for the day is displayed on the calendar incompletely,
while other days may appear that the space on a given day is more fully
utilized.

RESOLUTION
==========

Printing a Weekly View will yield more appointment space; thus, appointment
descriptions not appearing in the monthly view should appear on a Weekly View.
The Weekly View also allows for additional appointment information with a "More"
field, and it also has a "Notes:" field to print daily notes.

For larger numbers of appointments or verbose appointment information the Daily
View may be required to print complete appointment information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The amount of space is determined by the number of appointments on a given day.
The following table lists the number of spaces allocated (per line) to the day
based on the number of appointments for both portrait and landscape printing
schemes.

Number of         Number of lines            Number of lines
Appointments      Allocated per day          Allocated per day
                 (Portrait)                 (Landscape)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1                    11                       7
2                     5                       3
3                     3                       2
4                     2                       1
5                     2                       1
6                     1                       1

Therefore, a day consisting of 6 appointments on a portrait printout will appear
that only half the available space on a given day is being used since only 1
line is allocated for each appointment.

Portrait printing has a maximum of 11 appointments that can be printed on a given
day. Landscape has a maximum of 7 appointments. After this number is exceeded
the latest appointments will not get printed.
