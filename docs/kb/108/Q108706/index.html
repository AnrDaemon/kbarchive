SUMMARY
=======

Common Q&amp;A for Microsoft Visual C++, 32-Bit Edition
---------------------------------------------------

You can find the answers to more common questions by choosing "Technical Support"
from the Help menu in the Visual Workbench. The README.WRI file, located in the
\MSVCNT\HELP directory, also addresses many common issues.

1. Q. When I build my application, I get the warning, "LNK4016: unresolved
  external symbol `__doserrno'". What is causing this warning?

  A. The most likely cause of this error is using /MT (multithreaded run time)
  or /MD [run time in a DLL (dynamic-link library)] when building your
  application and linking with the supplied versions of the Microsoft
  Foundation Class (MFC) Libraries. To resolve this problem, you must rebuild
  the MFC libraries to use the same version of the run-time library as your
  application. Please see the README.WRI file located in \MSVCNT\HELP for more
  details.

2. Q. Can I use the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Libraries in a
  multithreaded program?

  A. Yes. However, all use of the Microsoft Foundation Classes must be in the
  same thread. Please see TechNote #37 for more detailed information.

3. Q. I copied a sample project from the Visual C++ CD to my hard drive. Visual
  C++ is treating the sample as a read-only project. What's wrong?

  A. When files are copied from a CD to a hard drive, the files are given the
  read-only attribute. You can change the attribute by using the ATTRIB command
  in MS-DOS, or by choosing Properties from the File menu in the File Manager.
  Note that if you change the attribute of the file, you should also change the
  attribute of its directory.

4. Q. Where is the MFC200.DLL file located?

  A. MFC 2.0 does not support AFXDLLs (MFC in a DLL and extension DLLs) in this
  version of the Visual C++ development system for Windows NT. For more
  information, see the "Microsoft Foundation Class Library Update" at the
  beginning of the Class Library Reference.

5. Q. Can I use .VBX controls with App Studio and MFC 2.0?

  A. .VBX controls are 16-bit DLLs and are not supported in the 32-bit Visual
  C++ environment.

6. Q. I rebuilt my program with the 32-bit version of Visual C++, but now I get
  heap errors when I run my program. What is wrong?

  A. If you were using the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) before, it's
  very possible that you were writing past the memory block and not being
  caught. The Win32 SDK run-time libraries often allocate more space than is
  requested. The Visual C++ run time is more strict with heap allocations.

7. Q. In Windows 3.1, I could send my diagnostic output (OutputDebugString
  messages and MFC TRACE output) to the communications (com) port or my
  monochrome monitor. How do I do that in the Visual C++ development system for
  Windows NT?

  A. Under Windows NT, debug output is available only to the debugger of the
  process that issues the message. If you want to see the debug output of a
  program, run it under Visual Workbench integrated debugger or use the DEB
  (Debug Event Browser) sample in MSVCNT\SAMPLES\DEB.
