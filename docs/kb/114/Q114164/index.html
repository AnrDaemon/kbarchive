-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to view a WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 for Windows document as an
attachment in Microsoft Mail for Windows with WordPerfect for Windows running as
a background application, will result in the following error message:

  The application could not be executed

CAUSE
=====

This error message is not caused by Microsoft Mail for PC Networks; it occurs as
a result of WordPerfect for Windows not supporting the Multiple Document
Interface (MDI).

RESOLUTION
==========

According to WordPerfect Technical Support, this is a known issue with
WordPerfect and there is no workaround at this time. To open a WordPerfect
attachment from within any Windows application, you cannot have WordPerfect
running as a background application at the same time. For Microsoft Mail, you
must leave the Mail client, close WordPerfect for Windows, reenter the Mail
client, and then open the attachment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The same error message can be generated and demonstrated without Microsoft Mail
running, as follows:

1. Start WordPerfect for Windows and minimize it.

2. Either

  - Again attempt to start WordPerfect for Windows from its icon.

  -or-

  - Use File Manager and try to run WPWIN.EXE.

WordPerfect for Windows is manufactured by WordPerfect Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
