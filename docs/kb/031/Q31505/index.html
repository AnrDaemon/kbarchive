When you link separate modules together to make an .EXE program, all
the modules must have been compiled with the same math package. The
two math packages available in Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00
and 6.00b and in Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
versions 7.00 and 7.10 are as follows:

1. BC /FPi (IEEE coprocessor-emulation math, the default)
2. BC /FPa (alternate math)

If you LINK modules or libraries together that were compiled with both
the BC /FPa and /FPi options, the .EXE program gives the following
error message at run time and usually hangs:

   Error during run-time initialization

Combining math packages can cause unpredictable results in the .EXE
program at run time. After the error message appears, a warm boot
(CTRL+ALT+DEL) does not work. To reboot, you must turn the computer
off, then back on.

To avoid this problem, make sure when you LINK routines that they were
compiled with the same math package. Also, remember that the QB.EXE
environment of the BASIC compiler and the QBX.EXE environment of BASIC
PDS 7.00 and 7.10 do not support the alternate math package. In other
words, object modules compiled with the /FPa switch cannot be placed
into a Quick library (.QLB file) for use in QB.EXE or QBX.EXE.
