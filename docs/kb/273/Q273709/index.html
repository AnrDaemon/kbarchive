SYMPTOMS
========

When you create users with the Active Directory Management Agent, the password
may not be set correctly. However, the user is able to log on with a blank
password.

In the Compass client computer's operator's log, the following error message may
be reported:

  ERR_00 0300 00/09/08 14:23:58.594 (AD-MA_LdapInitSSL) Couldn't connect to
  domain controller SERVER FQDN on port 636, LDAP error = 81 - Server Down

  ERR_00 0300 00/09/08 14:23:58.595 (AD-MA_dataFlowFromMdToAd) Failed to
  establish 128-bit SSL connection to &lt;Server fdqn&gt;

where &lt;Server fqdn&gt; is the fully qualified domain name of the domain
controller to which Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) attempts to connect
to.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the domain controller and MMS do not use a cipher
strength of 128-bits.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install the 128-bit High Encryption Pack on the MMS-based
server and all the domain controllers. If any Microsoft Windows 2000 service
packs are installed on the affected computers, reinstall the current service
pack.

In addition, refer to the MMS Active Directory Management Agent Administration
Manual. Under the Planning Issues section, read the Security Requirements. One
of the necessary requirements is to have an Enterprise-Wide Certificate
Authority in place along with 128-bit High Encryption.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 2000 Active Directory requires a connection over port 636 with 128-bit
cipher strength to set the user password attribute UnicodePwd. Other attributes
do not have this requirement.
