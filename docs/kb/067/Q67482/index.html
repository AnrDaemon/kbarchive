During a build inside the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) (using PWB.COM)
or while using NMK.COM from the command line, the build operation
returns successfully but no .EXE file is created.

This problem may be caused by an incorrectly set COMSPEC environment
variable. If the COMSPEC environment variable contains any extra
characters, NMK.COM fails to properly spawn the linker. This affects
the PWB as well because, under DOS, PWB.COM spawns the build commands
the same way as NMK.COM. Two examples of COMSPEC environment variables
that cause this problem are shown in the following:

   COMSPEC=C:\COMMAND.COM /E:512 /P
   COMSPEC=C:\COMMAND.COM;

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB.COM version 1.00
and NMK.COM version 1.00. This problem was corrected in PWB.COM
version 1.10 and NMK.COM version 1.11.
