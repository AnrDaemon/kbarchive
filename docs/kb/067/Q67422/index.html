SUMMARY
=======

The GameCard III (automatic MCA) built by CH Products provides two joystick
connectors. The top connector is A; the bottom connector is B. To use two
joysticks with Flight Simulator, the two jumpers behind connector A must be
removed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each joystick (via connector) has an X and Y axis available to it. With both
jumpers present, joystick A uses the Y axis of joystick B for throttle control.
At this point, connector A is referred to as a "one and a half joystick," and
the joysticks will interfere with each other and not operate correctly. Removing
both of the jumpers behind connector A disables the throttle control on joystick
A and allows normal use of both joysticks.

An alternative way to use two joysticks without removing the jumpers is to use a
Y-cable on connector A.
