SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Fast Technologies #1050 hard drive controller card, and your system
stops responding (hangs) at the Windows logo screen or exits to MS-DOS when you
run Microsoft Windows 3.0 in the enhanced mode. Windows functions correctly in
standard or real mode.

CAUSE
=====

This hard drive controller card uses a utility called BKWRTOFF.COM. The
BKWRTOFF.COM program turns off the deferred background and writes to the hard
drive. The hard drive controller card can hold reads and writes in static RAM.
Windows can go too fast for this utility and cause problems for the controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to Fast Technologies Product Support, to run Windows 3.0 in enhanced
mode with the Fast Technologies #1050 hard drive controller card, you must have
the following lines must be in the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

- VIRTUALHDIRQ=OFF

- EMMEXCLUDE= xxxxx-xxxxx

(where xxxxx is the adapter segment address that the controller occupies).

You must also run the BKWRTOFF.COM program before starting Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are still having a problem and are running with a super VGA card, you
might want to try resetting the hard drive controller card to the 8-bit mode.
The command for this is:

  TNT setup/x
