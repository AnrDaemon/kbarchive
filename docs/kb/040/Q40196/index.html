In C, comments are delimited by /*  and */. If the closing delimiter
is typed as *\ instead of */, then the backslash will be viewed as a
continuation marker. As a result, the compiler considers everything up
to the next */ as a comment. This behavior has the potential to
comment out executable instructions and data declarations, which may
not be your intent.

The following code example illustrates this situation and potential
implications:

void main()
{
  /* this is a comment, but the end delimiter is incorrect *\

  int  temp ;
  printf ("hello") ;

  /* and will be interpreted as a continuation marker so the
     initial comment will be viewed as ending here. */

  /* This will eliminate the printf() and
     the declaration of 'temp'. */
}

This is expected behavior for QuickC Version 2.00. The interpretation
of the backslash as a continuation character is similar in the
following printf() code:

    printf ("Donde esta \
             el bano") ;

The parsing of the string literal for this printf() will view the
backslash, "\", as a continuation marker just as the compiler will
view the backslash in "*\" as a continuation marker.
