Microsoft QuickBASIC can incorporate PCX files created with the
Microsoft Mouse Paintbrush package through the use of the FRIEZE
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program. The FRIEZE TSR is included
in the Microsoft Mouse Paintbrush package and can be loaded up into
memory by running the PAINT.BAT file located on the Microsoft Mouse
Utilities distribution disk. The steps you should first take are as
follows:

1. Load the FRIEZE TSR into memory from within a batch file.

2. Load your QuickBASIC program, which will issue an interrupt 5. This
   makes the TSR active, allowing you to load a PCX file from disk
   into the video-card memory.

Your QuickBASIC program then can BSAVE the four EGA planes--red,
green, blue, and intensity--out to disk. This makes it possible to
include high quality, color pictures in QuickBASIC programs.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50 for MS-DOS and Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and
6.00b and Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

The following is a code example:
