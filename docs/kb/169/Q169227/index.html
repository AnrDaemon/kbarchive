The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Windows 95 client does not process your logon script, terminates the script
prematurely, or the script stops responding (hangs) during processing.

CAUSE
=====

There are several reasons that your client may not be properly processing your
script file.

- There is an environment variable such as %USERNAME% specified in the logon
  script. Windows 95 does not understand all of the environment variables that
  Windows NT does. In order to have this type of functionality, you must use a
  third-party script application, such as KiXtart.

- There may be a batch file that has been called that has not terminated
  properly.

- User Manager for Domains is not configured to launch the Script file such as
  the file name is mistyped. This is configured in User Manager from
  User/Properties on the menu bar and selecting the Profile button.

- The file does not exist in the Netlogon share on every domain controller in
  the logon domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may see different behavior on a computer running Windows NT Workstation or
Windows NT Server. For full Environment Variable functionality, upgrade to
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server.

NOTE: For more information on KiXtart, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
