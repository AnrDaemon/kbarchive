SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to run Network Monitor, you may receive the following error
message:

  Admin permissions are required for running Netmon on this machine.

CAUSE
=====

This error can be generated if you do not have Administrator rights on the
computer, and can also be caused by problems with the registry.

Some of the problems with the registry might include incorrect permissions on the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Bh key and its subkeys, or
general registry problems such as the Maximum Registry Size has been reached or
exceeded.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that you are an Administrator (or have administrator equivalency).

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Make sure that the user you are logged on as has full control of the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Services\bh key and all of its subkeys.

Make sure the Maximum Registry Size in the Control Panel System tool is set
appropriately. For example, make sure that the registry has some room to grow
and that the registry's size limit has not been exceeded.
