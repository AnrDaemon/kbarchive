The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following POP3 clients were tested against Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0:

  Microsoft MAPI POP provider (Win16/Win32)
  Internet Explorer (Win16/Win32)
  Eudora 2.0 / 3.0 (Win16/Win32/Macintosh)
  Netscape 2.0 / 3.0 (Win16/Win32/Macintosh)
  Pegasus (Freeware) (Win16/Win32)

Many other, lesser known, clients were tested against the Exchange Server beta
release.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Outlook Express Client can work as a POP3 client or as an IMAP client. You
can select the type of the OE client during the setup process. OE is installed
with Internet Explorer 4.0.

Internet Message Access Protocol, version 4 rev. 1 (IMAP4), has more features
than the POP3 protocol. With IMAP4, your mail is stored on the server, you can
download the headers of a message (such as From, Subject, To)and you can decide
to open only a few messages. With POP3, you must download the entire bodies of
email in your Inbox.

And unlike POP3, with IMAP you can access all of your mailbox folders. The IMAP4
protocol was specified in RFC 2060, and is supported by Exchange Server 5.5 and
above.

POP and IMAP are both for receiving mail only. The SMTP protocol is used for
sending email.
