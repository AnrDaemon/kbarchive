SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the mouse or arrow keys to move off the statement:

     Sub X ()

the End Sub statement is not generated, and the Sub X() statement appears as part
of the subroutine that follows it.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The purpose of this behavior is to give you control over
whether or not an End Sub is automatically generated. There are cases when it is
desirable not to have an End Sub generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Leaving the Sub line by pressing the ENTER key automatically generates the
appropriate End Sub. This also adds the End Sub where one did not exist if you
previously left the line by using the mouse or arrow keys.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic version 4.0 supports conditional compilation and you may want to
take advantage of that to create more than one Sub statement for a single
subroutine depending on various conditions.

     #if WIN32 then
     Sub MySubWin32version(x)
     #else
     Sub MySubWin16version(x,y)
     #endif

        ' ...
     End Sub

In this case, you would not want two End Sub statements generated for your two
Sub statements. If you move off the first Sub statement with the ENTER key and
the second Sub statement with the mouse or arrows, this procedure is generated
correctly. As Visual Basic cannot anticipate which case will require End Sub and
which will not, you are given explicit control.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Type the following line of code in the General Declarations section of Form1,
  but don't press the ENTER key:

     Sub Test()

3. Use the mouse or arrow keys to move off the line. Sub Test does not get its
  own End Sub statement, but rather it is merged with the next Sub statement as
  in this example:

     Sub Test()
     Private Sub Form_Load()

     End Sub

4. To add an End Sub, move to the end of the Sub Test() line, and press the
  ENTER key to separate the Sub Test() procedure from the Sub Form_Load()
  procedure:

     Sub Test()

     End Sub
