SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to access the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the World
Wide Web.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Knowledge Base is a primary Microsoft product information source
that Microsoft support professionals use to help customers. This source is also
available to Microsoft customers. This comprehensive database includes more than
250,000 detailed articles containing technical information about Microsoft
products, fix lists, documentation errors, and answers to commonly asked
technical support questions. These articles are also available through the
Microsoft TechNet CD and the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) CD.

Connecting to the Microsoft World Wide Web site requires a "live" session to the
Internet through an Internet service provider.

Before you can access the Knowledge Base on the World Wide Web you must log on to
your Internet account and start a World Wide Web browser. Netscape and Microsoft
Internet Explorer are just two of the many browsers available.


Accessing the Microsoft Knowledge Base
--------------------------------------

1. Connect to the Microsoft Support site at the following address:

  http://search.support.microsoft.com/

2. In the My Question Is About box, select All Products. To access Knowledge
  Base articles in a specific product area, select the product name.

3. In the My Question Is box, type the question you have, or keywords you want
  to search for.

4. Under Search Options, click Keyword or Boolean search.

  If you are unable to see the Search Options, click More Search Options to
  display them.

5. Click Find (located next to the My Question Is box).

  This search will return from one to several article titles.
