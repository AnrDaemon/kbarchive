apply to localized (foreign language) versions.


MORE INFORMATION
================

  3.1x or Windows 95.

- Any Pan European version of Windows 95 over English version of Windows 3.1x
  or Windows 95.

- Localized version of Windows 95 over the same localized version of Windows
  3.1x or Windows 95.

  3.1x or Windows 95

Windows 98 Supported Upgrade Configurations
-------------------------------------------

- English version of Windows 98 over Pan European version of Windows 3.1x or
  Windows 95.

  3.1x or Windows 95/98.

Windows 98 Unsupported Upgrade Configurations
---------------------------------------------

- English version of Windows 98 over localized version of Windows 3.1x or
  Windows 95/98.

NOTE: There is no Pan European version of Windows 98. Pan European functionality
is included in the English version.

"Pan European" refers to the version of Windows that is distributed in Eastern
European countries such as Poland, Greece and Turkey. The Pan European version
of Windows is very similar to the English version, but supports extended
characters that are used in those regions.

Other European language versions of Windows, such as German, French, Spanish, and
Italian, are considered "localized" versions.
