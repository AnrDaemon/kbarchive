The information given in the Microsoft QuickC Compiler Version 2.00
on-line help for the fopen() function is incomplete. The following is
a more complete description of the "type" parameter, taken from Page
274 of the "Microsoft QuickC Version 2.00 Run-Time Library Reference"
manual.

The character string "type" specifies the type of access requested for
the file, as follows:

Type     Description

"r"      Opens for reading. If "r" is the first character in type, and
         the file does not exist or cannot be found, the fopen call
         will fail.

"w"      Opens an empty file for writing. If the given file exists,
         its contents are destroyed.

"a"      Opens for writing at the end of the file (appending); creates
         the file first if it doesn't exist.

"r+"     Opens for both reading and writing. (The file must exist.)

"w+"     Opens an empty file for both reading and writing. If the
         given file exists, its contents are destroyed.

"a+"     Opens for reading and appending; creates the file first if it
         doesn't exist.

Please note: Use the "w" and "w+" types with care, as they can destroy
existing files.
