SYMPTOMS
========

If you manually copied the compressed files located on the Run-Time ToolBook
Setup Disk onto your hard disk, you may receive the error "Insufficient Memory
to Run Application" when trying to click the following files in the TOOLBOOK
directory:

  TBOOK.EXE
  DAYBOOK.TBK
  DBHELP.TBK
  TOURBOOK.TBK

WORKAROUND
==========

If you must set up DayBook by manually copying the files to the hard drive, you
must first decompress the files with the Windows EXPAND.EXE program. This can be
accomplished by doing the following:

1. Place the Windows 3.0 Disk 2 into Drive A. From the MS-DOS prompt, type "A:"
  (without the quotation marks), then press ENTER.

2. Type "COPY EXPAND.EXE C:\" (without the quotation marks). This copies the
  EXPAND.EXE file to the root of Drive C.

3. Create a backup copy of the ToolBook disk(s), and delete the files
  TBKSETUP.EXE and TBKSETUP.INF from this backup.

4. Place the backup of the ToolBook Setup Disk into Drive A and type the
  following:

  EXPAND A: *.* C:\TOOLBOOK

  NOTE: This step requires that you have already created the TOOLBOOK directory
  on Drive C.

5. When all the files have been successfully decompressed and copied to Drive C,
  associate the file DAYBOOK.TBK with ToolBook. Page 135 of the "Microsoft
  Windows User's Guide" describes how to associate files with applications.

The above steps does not create the icons or the group for the DayBook
application or the Introduction to ToolBook application. This can be done by
following the instructions listed on Pages 87-91 of the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps outline the normal setup procedure for DayBook and the
Introduction to ToolBook. This setup automatically decompresses the files and
create icons, the group and associations for both applications.

1. Make sure Windows 3.0 has been successfully installed and type "WIN" (without
  the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt to start Windows.

2. Insert the Run-Time ToolBook Setup Disk into Drive A, and Type "A:" (without
  the quotation marks) to make Drive A active.

3. From the File menu, Choose Run from within the Program Manager.

4. Type A:\TBKSETUP and click OK.
