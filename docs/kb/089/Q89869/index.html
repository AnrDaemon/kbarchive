SUMMARY
=======

If more than one version of the Sound Blaster Pro virtual device driver is
listed in the SYSTEM.INI file's [386ENH] section, the sound card may continue to
play the System Exit sound in MS-DOS after you have exited Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro is an audio card capable of playing both wave
and MIDI files. In the more recent release of the Soundblaster Pro, the filename
for the virtual device driver has been changed. When the old line in the
SYSTEM.INI file for the virtual device driver is not removed during the
installation of the new driver, two or more virtual device drivers are loaded.

This causes the sound card to continue to play the System Exit sound even after
Windows is no longer running. It may be necessary to restart the computer to
stop the sound. Check the SYSTEM.INI file's [386ENH] section for the following
entries:

     DEVICE=VSBD.386
     DEVICE=VADLIBD.386
     DEVICE=VSBPD.386

RESOLUTION
==========

If one or both of the first two device lines are present, remove the first
lines, leaving only:

       DEVICE=VSBPD.386

Sound Blaster Pro is manufactured by Creative Labs, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
