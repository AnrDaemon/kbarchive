SUMMARY
=======

Most computer books, including most Microsoft Press books, assume that the
reader already has purchased and installed the related software that the book is
written about. Without the software, the book may not be useful.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As an example, "Microsoft Excel 97 Step by Step" requires that you already have
Microsoft Excel 97 installed on your computer. Without Microsoft Excel 97, the
Practice Files are not readable and the lessons in the book cannot be followed.

Books that do not have a companion disk or CD-ROM are less dependent on the
related software. However, we still recommend that you have access to the
related software in order to practice with or use the information in the book.

There are a few Microsoft Press books that do include a working model or
time-limited evaluation edition of the related software. In very rare cases, the
book might include a full version of the related software. These titles will
specifically state, typically on the front or back cover of the book, that the
book includes the related software. Some titles that come with a version of the
related software include:

- Learn Java Now

- Learn Visual Basic Now

- Learn Visual C++ Now

- Microsoft Network Administration Training

- Microsoft SQL Server Training

- Microsoft Windows NT Technical Support Training

- Microsoft Visual Basic Deluxe Learning Edition
