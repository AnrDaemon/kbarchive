-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using the SNA Print Service against an IBM S/36 system, the S/36 console
displays the following error message whenever a print job is printed:

  Unexpected data received from printer (print device)

When this error occurs, the S/36 console operator must acknowledge this message
before further print jobs are spooled to the printer.

CAUSE
=====

When the S/36 finishes sending a print job to SNA Server Print Server, the S/36
gives direction to the printer. The print server responds by sending a print
status message and providing direction to the S/36. This causes the S/36 to
detect an error and log the following error to the S/36 console:

  Unexpected data received from printer (print device)

The S/36 appears to expect the print emulator to have the send state on the
conversation after the print job has completed, and wait until the S/36 asks for
conversation direction. This is different from AS/400 printing, where an AS/400
printer always provides direction back to the AS/400 along with a print status
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0
SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.
