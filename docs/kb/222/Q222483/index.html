-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) to a Small Business Server
(SBS) version 4.0-based or 4.0a-based computer, you may experience performance
problems and the following services may no longer function properly:

- Remote Access service

- Modem Sharing

- Fax Server

- Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 and 4.0

- Microsoft Proxy Server 1.0 and 2.0

- The Manage Server Console

Small Business Server-specific RAS files are overwritten by the Service Pack 3
for Windows NT 4.0 installation. Because RAS is directly affected, the services
listed above may no longer function properly depending on how the server is set
up.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur after you manually apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 to
your SBS version 4.0 or 4.0a-based computer. When you do so, some SBS files are
overwritten with incorrect versions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

- If Service Pack 3 has only been applied once and the "Create uninstall
  directory" option was selected during the installation, run Service Pack 3
  Setup again and choose the "Uninstall a previously installed Service Pack" to
  roll back Small Business Server to the SBS-specific version of Service Pack
  3.

- Restore a backup of your SBS computer made before you applied Windows NT 4.0
  Service Pack 3.

- Reinstall SBS version 4.0 or 4.0a.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
