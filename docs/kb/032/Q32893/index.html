Problem:
   I have two huge pointers that are more than 32K apart. However,
whenever I take the difference between them, I get an incorrect
answer. I am using the following code:

char huge *ptr1 = (char huge *)0xa0000000;
char huge *ptr2 = (char huge *)0xb0000000;
main()
{
  long k;
  k = ptr2-ptr1;
  printf("difference is %ld\n",k);
}

Response:
   This problem occurs because the difference between two pointers is
considered to be an integer quantity. The arithmetic that is done on
the huge pointers is 32-bit arithmetic, but the result is truncated to
an integer, then promoted back to a long value with a sign extension.
   To retain the original long value returned by the huge-pointer
arithmetic, cast the result of the subtraction to a long value. For
example, you will get the expected results with the following code:

char huge *ptr1 = (char huge *)0xa0000000;
char huge *ptr2 = (char huge *)0xb0000000;
main()
{
  long k;
  k = (long)(ptr2-ptr1); /* cast the integer to a long */
  printf("difference is %lp\n",k);
}
</code></pre></div></div>
