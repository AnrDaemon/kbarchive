<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q47748
Product(s): See article
Version(s): 1.01 2.00 2.01
Operating System(s): OS/2
Keyword(s): ENDUSER | S_QuickASM | mspl13_c
Last Modified: 10-OCT-1989

When using QuickC in the DOS compatibility box under OS/2, if a file
is locked by another application, the environment lists the file (for
example, in File.Open), but if an attempt is made to open the file, an
error is displayed. The file obviously exists, because the environment
just listed it. Yet, in QuickC Version 2.00 and QuickC with
QuickAssembler Version 2.01, the error displayed in the dialog box is
"File Does Not Exist." In QuickC Version 1.01, the error displayed is
"General Failure."

This problem is a result of the fact that QuickC is designed for the
single-user, DOS environment, and does not deal gracefully with a
locked file. If you swap to the other screen group, and release the
file, QuickC then loads the file.

Note: This is a particular problem when merging files into another
document in a protected-mode program. If, for example, you merge the
file into a letter in Word 5.00 running in protected mode, and try to
load the file into QuickC running in the DOS box, you will encounter
this problem, and it will not be immediately apparent that the file is
actually being used by another application. Saving the file in Word
releases Word's hold on the file, since it then becomes a part of the
letter.
