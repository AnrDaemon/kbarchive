The run-time library function bsearch() is documented on Page 147 in
the "Microsoft C for the MS-DOS Operating System: Run-Time Library
Reference" as returning a pointer to the first occurrence of key in
the array pointed to by base. This may not be true when multiple
elements of the array match the key. In the case where multiple
elements match the key, bsearch returns a pointer to the first element
that it finds, not necessarily the first element of the array that
matches the key. This is the proper action for bsearch to take. The
documentation should read as follows:

   Return Value:

   The bsearch function returns a pointer to the occurrence of key in
   the array pointed to by base. If there is more than one occurrence
   of key, the pointer returned by bsearch may point to any of them.
   If key is not found, the function returns NULL.

The behavior occurs because of the nature of the binary search
algorithm. If you need to find the first matching element, use the
lfind() (linear find) function instead of bsearch(). Note: Linear
finds are much slower than binary searches.

Below is a sample program that demonstrates this behavior:

#include &lt;search.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int qcompare();  /* declare a function for qsort's compare   */
int bcompare();  /* declare a function for bsearch's compare */

main (argc, argv)
int argc;
char **argv;
{
    char **result;
    char *key = "Brad";
    int i;

    /* Sort using Quicksort algorithm: */

    qsort((char *) argv, argc, sizeof(char *), qcompare);
    for (i = 0; i&lt;argc; ++i)                        /* Output sorted list */
        printf("%s\n", argv[i]);

    /* Find item that begins with "Brad" using a binary search algorithm: */

    result = (char **) bsearch((char *) &amp;key, (char *) argv, argc,
        sizeof(char *), bcompare);
    if (result)
        printf("%s found\n", *result);
    else
        printf("PATH not found !\n");
}

int qcompare (arg1, arg2)
char **arg1, **arg2;
{                      /* Compare all of both strings: */
    return (strcmp(*arg1, *arg2));
}

int bcompare (arg1, arg2)
char **arg1, **arg2;
{                      /* Compare to length of key: */
    return (strncmp(*arg1, *arg2, strlen(*arg1)));
}

The program sorts the command line args and then compares them with
the key "Brad". If you enter the command line arguments, Brad1 Brad2
Doug, you find that the bsearch routine returns Brad2. Note: The
number is not checked because the bcompare function checks only the
first four characters.

Since BSEARCH cuts the array section being searched in half with each
check, it finds Brad2 before Brad1. Instead of continuing to search
for the first occurrence of Brad (as is documented), it immediately
returns with a pointer to Brad2 (which is the proper action).
