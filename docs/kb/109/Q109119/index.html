The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you transfer files 20 megabytes (MB) or larger through File Manager, the
transfer takes a long time, and in some cases the transfer fails.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Use stripe sets across multiple physical drivers, with NTFS on all drives, to the
following:

1. Create a share on the first stripe set (drive E) and name it TEST. Include a
  28 MB text file called TEST.TXT.

2. On the second drive (drive F), create a share called PUBLIC.

3. Use the NET USE command to connect to both shares.

4. From File Manager, select drive E, and then select the TEST.TXT file.

5. From the File menu, choose Copy.

6. In the Copy dialog box, enter "F:\" (without the quotation marks) in the To
  field.

7. From the server, open a command prompt and do a Dir on drive F. The TEST.TXT
  file is in this directory with a size of 0 bytes.

8. Open a second window on Server Manager. From the Properties menu, choose
  Server, and then select In Use. The following four sessions are open between
  the workstation and the server:

  - A read from drive E
  - A read from drive F
  - A read from drive E
  - A write to drive F

It appears the Copy command is being carried out at this time. Disk activity
stops on the server after approximately four minutes. The sessions are closed,
if you quickly do a Dir from the command prompt, the file appears in the drive F
directory, and the size is correct. Do a Dir again and the file is gone. On the
workstation, from File Manager, a STOP sign appears, with the message saying the
session was closed, and the copy command could not be carried out. If the same
command is done from the command line, it is carried out fine:

  C:\copy e:\test.txt f:\
