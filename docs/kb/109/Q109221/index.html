The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Creative Writer and Fine Artist setup does not run in Windows 3.1 Standard Mode
and generates the following message if you try to run setup without being in
Enhanced Mode:

  You need to run Windows in Enhanced Mode to run Setup.

The advanced animation and sound features in Creative Writer and Fine Artist
require Windows to be running in Enhanced Mode. These features are not
adequately supported by Standard Mode. That is why the Creative Writer and Fine
Artist boxes state that you need a 386 or higher processor, and recommend a
minimum of 4MB of RAM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do the following:

1. Exit Windows.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type "win /3" (without the quotation marks).
  This runs Windows in enhanced mode.

3. Insert the Creative Writer or Fine Artist diskette (or CD-ROM) in drive.

4. From the File menu in Program Manager, choose Run.

5. Diskette: Type "a:\setup" (without the quotation marks) and press "ENTER"
  (without the quotation marks). CD-ROM: Type "d:\setup" (without the quotation
  marks) and press "ENTER" (without the quotation marks).

After following these steps, you should be able to install Creative Writer or
Fine Artist successfully.
