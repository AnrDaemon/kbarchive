SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to disable the installation of the Exchange client
during Windows NT Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Windows NT, the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows NT is
installed and an Exchange icon is placed on the desktop. To disable the
installation of the Exchange client during Windows NT Setup, follow these
steps:

WARNING: Modifications to INF files incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from modifications of INF files can
be solved. Use this method at your own risk.

NOTE: This procedure requires that you install (locally or over the network) from
a flat folder on a hard drive. To complete these steps, you must be able to
modify the Syssetup.inf file. By default, the Syssetup.inf file is compressed on
the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

1. Copy the I386 folder from the Windows NT CD-ROM to a hard drive.

2. In the I386 folder on the hard drive, expand the Syssetup.in_ file to
  Syssetup.inf using the following command:

  "expand Syssetup.in_ Syssetup.inf" (without the quotation marks)

  NOTE: Expand.exe must be run from within Windows NT.

3. Rename the Syssetup.in_ file to Syssetup.old. By default, setup will use the
  compressed version if both exist.

4. Open Syssetup.inf in a text editor, and then place a semicolon before the
  MSMAIL.INF entry in the [BaseWinOptionsInfs] section of the file.

  The change should look like this:

  [BaseWinOptionsInfs]
  accessor.inf
  communic.inf
  games.inf
  imagevue.inf
  mmopt.inf
  ;msmail.inf
  multimed.inf
  optional.inf
  pinball.inf
  wordpad.inf

The procedure to disable the installation of the Exchange client described above
works with a local, network, or local installation of Windows NT.
