-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT 4.0 Setup from the three Setup floppy disks, or when you
run Setup using the WINNT /B command, your computer may stop responding while
the following message is displayed:

  Setup is inspecting your computer's hardware configuration.


CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 installation compact disc meets the El Torito specification
using Non-Emulation mode regarding bootable CD-ROM media. Some newer computers
support the El Torito specification but adhere to Emulation-mode
specifications.


Some system BIOSes that support the El Torito specification in Emulation mode
interfere with Windows NT Setup and cause the computer to hang during the
hardware detection process. It seems that the BIOS grabs the CD-ROM device
during the Power On System Test (POST) and causes Windows NT hardware detection
to hang. This can also happen if you leave CD-ROM drive in the boot sequence
(drive C, CD-ROM drive, drive A).

RESOLUTION
==========

The system BIOS may display that it recognizes a bootable CD-ROM during POST.
There are usually CMOS options that allow you to select which boot devices to
try and in what order. We recommend disabling the option to boot from the CD-ROM
drive in the CMOS settings.

We also recommend that you not leave the Windows NT CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive
until after the computer configuration detection is finished. Or, contact the
manufacturer of your computer or system BIOS for an updated BIOS to correct the
problem.

Note that this is only one cause of the problem. Other causes include IRQ
conflicts, an incorrect HAL, external caching, and shadowing options in the CMOS
settings.
