SYMPTOMS
========

When adding a record to a remote view, sometimes the record does not appear in
the table after updating. Or the following error may occur when trying to close
the view:

  Table buffer for alias &lt;view name&gt; contains uncommitted changes

Even though the "Send SQL Updates" box is checked in the Update Criteria tab of
the view, make sure that the Updateable (marked with a pencil symbol) column for
the primary key is checked also.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Depending on the rules that are applied to a table, many times a rule requires
that the primary key field of a new record must have a value placed into it
before the record is saved.

It is often assumed that while in the Update Criteria tab of the View Designer,
selecting a primary key field in the Field Name list box and then clicking the
Update All button updates the primary key and all other fields in the list box.
This is not entirely true; while all of the other fields have the Updatable
column (marked with the pencil symbol) checked, the Updateable column of the
primary key is not checked. It has to be checked manually in order for the
primary field to be updated. If the primary key field is not checked, this
causes the record not to be added to the table.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a database.

2. From the File menu, click New. Click Remote View and click New.

3. Select a connection or data source in the list box and supply the correct
  information to connect.

4. Add a table from the list box.

5. In the Fields tab, select all records.

6. In the Update Criteria tab, check the Send SQL Updates box and make sure that
  there is a primary key checked. Click Update All to select all of the fields
  to be updated.

7. Run the view and click Append New Record from the Table menu. Add data to the
  fields and close the Browse window.

8. Close the view after naming it; reopen and run it. Note that the record that
  you added is not there. By going into the View Designer and checking the
  Updatable column on the primary key field, a record can now be added to the
  table. Note that if the table that the view is created on does not have rules
  that the primary key field must have a value in it. It is then possible to
  add a record but the primary key field is left blank.
