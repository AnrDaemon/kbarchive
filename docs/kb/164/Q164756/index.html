SYMPTOMS
========

Currently, it is not easy to determine the current version of a Systems
Management Server client. The Systems Management Server database does not show
whether a client has been updated when you apply a service pack or a new version
of Systems Management Server.

With Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 2, each client, logon server, or
site will have a Csdver.sms file in the Ms\Sms\Bin directory. The supplied
Sms12sp2.pdf file will contain an inventory rule to look for the existence of
the Csdver.sms file with a certain time/date stamp.

Administrator-only stations (without the Ms\Sms\Bin directory) can be identified
by the presence of the Smsres.dll file. A separate inventory package would need
to be created manually for this purpose.

The Systems Management Server Administrator tool installed on Windows NT client
computers is not automatically updated when a service pack is applied.
Therefore, when you click About on the Help menu in the Systems Management
Server Administrator program on these computers, the current service pack level
may be incorrect. To update the Systems Management Server Administrator program
on Windows NT client computers, you must install the service pack on the client
computer. Setup will detect that the client is an Administration tools only
computer, and allow only the option to upgrade the tool.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
