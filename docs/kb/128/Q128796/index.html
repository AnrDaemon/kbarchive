- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When After Dark version 2.0 loads in Windows NT and you attempt to start an
application that uses a device connected to a serial communication (COM) port,
the following error message appears:

  The selected COM port is either not supported or is being used by another
  device.

  Select another port.

If you select another port, the same error message appears again.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when After Dark 2.0 SystemIQ Activity Monitor runs before
you start the application using the COM ports.

SystemIQ Activity Monitor monitors serial and parallel port activity as well as
CPU load. As activity of the CPU or external devices increases, After Dark does
not blank out the screen to provide maximum processing time to other tasks.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Run the After Dark Control program and choose Setup.

2. Clear the SystemIQ Activity Monitor check box.

3. Using a text editor, open the AD_PREFS.INI file. This file is located at the
  Windows NT %SystemRoot% directory.

4. In the [After Dark] section of AD_PREFS.INI, change "WatchComPorts=1,2,3,4"
  to ";WatchComPorts=1,2,3,4" (without the quotation marks).

  NOTE: If one specific COM port is used by the COM device continuously, such as
  Terminal or Remote Access Service), remove only the port number. You do not
  have to remark out (;) the entire line.

5. If you experience problems with the parallel ports, change the
  "WatchParallelPorts=1,2,3" entry in the [After Dark] section of AD_PREFS.INI
  file to ";WatchParallelPorts=1,2,3" (without the quotation marks).

  NOTE: If one specific parallel port is used by a parallel device continuously,
  remove only the port number. You do not have to remark out (;) the entire
  line. The problem with parallel ports does not cause the message above to
  appear.
