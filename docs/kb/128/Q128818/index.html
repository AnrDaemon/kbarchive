SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade a Windows NT 3.1 installation on an AST Manhatten
SMP machine with a Mylex DAC960 SCSI controller, Windows NT 3.5 Setup fails to
recognize the Windows NT 3.1 installation. As a result, setup performs a new
installation rather than upgrading you Windows NT 3.1 installation.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Windows NT 3.5 Setup does not recognize the Mylex
driver for Windows NT 3.1 as a driver that it can upgrade correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

NOTE: These instructions require that you have the Windows NT 3.1 drivers for the
Mylex controller on a floppy disk. These instructions will work correctly if you
installing from a CD-ROM drive, a floppy drive, or running a normal
WINNT/WINNT32 installation. The will not work if you have done a WINNT /B or
WINNT32 /B installation.

1. At the second setup screen, select Custom Setup.

2. During the SCSI detection portion of Setup, do not allow setup to auto-
  detect your SCSI controllers. Instead, skip the auto detection and choose to
  manually add SCSI drivers (Press S).

3. From the SCSI driver list, select "Other - requires disk provided by
  manufacturer) and insert the floppy disk with the Mylex drivers.

4. After the Mylex drivers have loaded, manually select drivers for any other
  controllers in the system.

5. Let Setup continue normally.

When you have finished upgrading to Windows NT 3.5, you can remove the old driver
and add in the 3.5 Mylex drivers using the Windows NT Setup Add/Remove SCSI
option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
