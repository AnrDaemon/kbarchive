-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components to access the
Exchange Server computer via a Web browser, the sample scripts allow you to mark
a message to be deleted by selecting the box next to the message.

After you select the button to delete the marked messages, you may receive the
following error message in a pop-up box in version 5.0:

  Unable to Delete Message

Or, in Exchange Server version 5.5, you may see this error message:

  Unable to Delete this Special Folder

Or, in Exchange Server version 5.5 with SP1, you may see this error message:

  Unable to Delete Item

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you read a message via the Web, you can choose to delete the message while
the message window is open. After you click Delete, the message window will
close, but the message list will not refresh.

If you mark the same message for deletion that you previously selected to delete
while the message window was open, you will get this error.

To verify that this is the case, select the Refresh button to reload the folder
contents. If the message is gone, you have previously deleted it.
