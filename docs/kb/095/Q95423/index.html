SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install Microsoft LAN Manager on a workstation
running IBM DOS version 5.02.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Setup program for Microsoft LAN Manager checks the operating system (OS)
version so that it can install the correct NETWKSTA.EXE, which is operating
system dependent. IBM DOS version 5.02 reports a version number not supported by
the LAN Manager Setup program.

When run on IBM DOS 5.02, LAN Manager Setup correctly copies files from floppy to
the user's hard disk (including all versions of NETWKSTA), and then reports an
error:

  Unable to read file: NETWKSTA. Error Code: 2

There are several ways to work around this error:

- Run LAN Manager Setup, and ignore the error. After Setup completes, manually
  copy

  C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETWKSTA\NETWKSTA.500

  as

  C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE

  Note: If LAN Manager is installed to a location other than C:\LANMAN.DOS,
  adjust the copy as appropriate. This method is simple, but one may copy the
  file incorrectly.

- Use the SETVER command to set the OS version for SETUP.EXE to 5.0, then
  install LAN Manager. After LAN Manager is installed, the version for
  SETUP.EXE should be deleted, so that other setup programs will know the
  correct OS version.

  This method is also simple to perform, but it requires two extra boots to set
  and remove the version for SETUP.EXE.

- Edit the LAN Manager SETUP.INF file on the LAN Manager MS-DOS Setup disk.
  Copy the line

  1:NETWKSTA\NETWKSTA.50$,"NETWKSTA\NETWKSTA.500",8,2

  as

  1:NETWKSTA\NETWKSTA.50$,"NETWKSTA\NETWKSTA.",8,2

  leaving the original line intact.

  Note: Make a copy of the disk, and edit that copy. Do not make changes to the
  original disk.

  This method is fairly simple, and it needs to be performed only once for any
  number of users. However, it will install NETWKSTA.500 on any unknown version
  of DOS.

- Install a previous version of MS-DOS, such as MS-DOS 5.0, then install LAN
  Manager. Finally, re-install IBM DOS 5.02.

  This is a straightforward method, but it is tedious and time consuming.

Note: A bootable over-the-network (OTN) installation disk for MS-DOS 5.0
workstations needs to be made with DOS version 5.0 (either IBM or Microsoft).
The workstation portion of OTN installation will not operate under IBM DOS
version 5.02.
