-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Clear Screen Saver tool, which is included with Supplement One of the
Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit, does not work correctly on multiple-monitor
workstations.

On monitors other than the primary monitor, the mouse cursor is not hidden, and
moving or clicking the mouse produces the same result that would occur if no
screen saver were running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This version of the Clear Screen Saver should not be used on machines with
multiple monitors.

In addition, this version of Clear Screen Saver has not been tested with terminal
services and is not recommended for use within a terminal server session.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
