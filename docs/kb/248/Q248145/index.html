SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Team Folders Wizard to create a public team folder on the
Exchange Server computer, the wizard installs everything correctly, but for some
users, all the views in the team folder display the Inbox instead of the correct
public folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs because the person viewing the team folder does not have
access to view a folder or items within a folder somewhere in the public folder
path where the team folder was created. When the permissions are set in this
manner, the properties set on the Outlook View Control ActiveX control are not
set correctly, and the HTML file defaults to the Inbox.

For example, if you create a public folder in the path
"AllPublicFolders\Company\TeamFolders\MyTeamFolder," and you have full
permissions to the TeamFolders folder, but can only view folders, not items
within the Company folder, all of the views in the TeamFolders folder are
displayed in your Inbox instead of in the public folder.

This behavior also occurs if a folder in the path is hidden to the user.
Therefore, the best practice is to create the team folder structure in a path on
which all users accessing the team folder have reviewer or better permissions.
The person creating the team folder needs reviewer permissions on all folders in
the path and author, or better, permissions on the folder that the team folder
is added to.
