-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Personal Web Server versions 1.0, 1.0a for Windows 95 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Personal Web Server version 1.0 for Windows 95 in
Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) by adding the appropriate network
service, ""Program Files\Personal Web Server"" and "Webshare" folders are
created. However, when you install Personal Web Server in OSR2 from an online
service (such as the Microsoft http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ Web site), a
"Program Files\Websvr" folder is created instead of a ""Program Files\Personal
Web Server"" folder.

In addition, if you install Personal Web Server by adding the appropriate network
service and then install it from an online service, the Program Files\Personal
Web Server folder may remain on your hard disk even though it is not being used
by Personal Web Server.

CAUSE
=====

The "Program Files\Personal Web Server" folder was changed to Program
Files\Websvr in the version of Personal Web Server currently available on online
services to prevent problems that might occur when you attempt to use Universal
Resource Locator (URL) addresses that contain long folder names. The "Program
Files\Personal Web Server" folder is not removed when you install Personal Web
Server from an online service to prevent removing any data files that you
created after you originally installed Personal Web Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the "Program Files\Personal Web Server" folder remains on your hard disk
after you install Personal Web Server from an online service, the existence of
the folder should not cause any problems. If you want to delete the folder to
create more free space on your hard disk, you should manually move any data
files that you created after you originally installed Personal Web Server from
the "Program Files\Personal Web Server" folder to the Program Files\Websvr
before you delete the folder.

NOTE: The files and folders in the "Program Files\Personal Web Server" folder
that were created by Personal Web Server when you originally installed it do not
need to be manually moved to the Program Files\Websvr folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine which version of Personal Web Server is currently installed, use My
Computer or Windows Explorer to locate the Inetsw95.exe file, right- click the
file, click Properties on the menu that appears, and then click the Version tab.
If the File Version line indicates that the file is version 4.70.1055, the
version of Personal Web Server included with OSR2 is installed. If the File
Version line indicates that the file is version 4.70.1181, the version of
Personal Web Server available on online services is installed.

NOTE: If you installed Personal Web Server by adding the appropriate network
service and then installed it from an online service, you may have two
Inetsw95.exe files on your computer. If one of the files is version 4.70.1181,
the version of Personal Web Server available on online services is installed.
