-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Novell NetWare redirector components are installed on the Microsoft Systems
Management Server (SMS) site server, performance may progressively decline.
Performance Monitor may appear to reveal a memory leak in the SMS_Executive
component, indicating that handles are being opened and not closed by the SMS
Executive component.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when a native NetWare application programming interface
(API) call to evaluate a server role is unable to determine if the server is a
NetWare server or a tree.

WORKAROUND
==========

This handle leak was fixed in the 4.6 version of the NetWare redirector. If you
are using an earlier version of the NetWare redirector, contact NetWare
technical support and request a fix, referencing SPD # 219843.

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
