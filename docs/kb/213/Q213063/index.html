The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NW_Logon_Server_Manager is unable to connect to a bindery server after the
bindery server is renamed.

CAUSE
=====

Once the bindery server is renamed, the redirector still caches the old server
name to allow current user connections to continue. However, new connections
fail because the SMS site attempts subsequent connections using the new bindery
server name. As a result, Systems Management Server is unable to connect to the
bindery server CAP and logon point until a reboot of the site server occurs. The
reboot of the server allows the redirector cache to clear, allowing successful
connection.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following steps outline the recommended procedure for changing the name of a
NetWare resource that is acting as an SMS Site System role:

1. Delete the NetWare logon point and/or CAP from the SMS Administrator Console.

2. Wait until the logon point and CAP are removed from the bindery server.

3. Rename the bindery server.

4. Restart the SMS Site server.

5. Create new a logon point and CAP using the new server name.
