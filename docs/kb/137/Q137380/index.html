-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows 95 Setup may not be able to finish successfully if any of the following
commands are used in the Config.sys or Autoexec.bat file:

  SUBST
  JOIN
  APPEND
  ASSIGN

Setup attempts to continue when these commands are used. However, it may be
necessary to remove them to install Windows 95 successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup attempts to work with these MS-DOS-based terminate-and-stay-resident
programs (TSRs) loaded. Although these TSRs may not cause problems, you may have
to remove them.

APPEND and ASSIGN
-----------------

Setup does not halt or remove these TSRs.

These programs are not provided in MS-DOS versions later than 5.0. You must
expand these programs from your MS-DOS 5.0 disks to regain their functionality,
and then run Setver.exe to set them to MS-DOS version 5.0.

The Append.exe file is also available on the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the
&lt;drive&gt;:\other\oldmsdos directory.

NOTE: These commands can be run only in MS-DOS mode.

JOIN
----

If this TSR is detected, Setup halts and warns you that there are cross- linked
files on the hard disk. Remove Join.exe from the Autoexec.bat file to finish
Setup.

Using the JOIN command may cause additional problems. For example, running an
MS-DOS session while Windows Explorer is open may result in the following error
message:

  Cannot find command.com

SUBST
-----

Setup does not halt or remove this TSR. Setup replaces any references to
Subst.exe in the Autoexec.bat file with the location of the Windows 95 version
of the file.

Using Setver.exe
----------------

You can use the SETVER command to enable programs and device drivers that require
an earlier version of MS-DOS to run in Windows 95.

You must use the SETVER command to enable Assign.exe, Append.exe, and Join.exe to
run in Windows 95.

For example, to add Append.exe to the version table, use the following command:

  setver c:\dos append.exe 5.00

REFERENCES
==========

For information about using Setver.exe, type "Setver /?" at a command prompt, or
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q96767 Using the SETVER Command

For information about using the SUBST, JOIN, and APPEND commands, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
