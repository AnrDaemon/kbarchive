Problem:

I have a number of far pointers pointing to various data items in my
program. I compiled the program in the small-memory model. However,
printf() will not return the data to the area in which the pointers
are pointing.

Response:

To use printf() to print data items (strings and pointers only) that
have been declared as far in a small- or medium-memory model, use F to
modify the %s or %p field. For example, if you have the following
declaration

   char far *ptr;

you can print out the value of the pointer with the following call:

   printf("%Fp",ptr);

You also can print out the string pointed to by ptr (assuming that it
has been initialized in your code) with the following call:

   printf("%Fs",ptr);

For additional information on the use of the F specifier with
printf(), refer to the  C run-time library reference or online help
that was supplied with your particular version of the compiler.
