The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to update collection membership, newly created users and groups do
not appear in the user and user group collections.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because these two collections differ from the others in
Systems Management Server (SMS) because their membership is controlled by
settings in discovery methods.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Activate Windows NT User Account Discovery and Windows NT Group Discovery,
  but do not change the polling interval. You should receive a list of both the
  users and user groups in your domain within their respective collections.

2. Create some new users and global user groups.

3. Right-click either of the collections, point to All Tasks, and then click
  Update Collection Membership. Although you may expect that the newly created
  users and groups appear as members of these collections after the update,
  this does not occur.

Nothing occurs as a result of this action because the membership update only
re-queries the database and only returns the data that exists therein.

However, after the next discovery cycle has completed (default is one day), the
new users and groups populate the database. Subsequently pointing to All Tasks,
and then clicking Update Collection Membership displays the new entries.

The discovery methods are responsible for collecting the data for users and user
groups. The new data only appears in the database after the next discovery cycle
completes. Subsequently, updating the collection membership reflects the new
users and groups.
