-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A program for a package created with the "Run Once For First User Who Logs On"
option is advertised and run. If you change the program properties option to
"Run Once For Every User Who Logs On", the advertisement runs a second time for
the one user who has already run the program.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule changes are generally treated as readvertisement of the program.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create a new program specifying the "Run Once For Every User Who Logs On"
option. Create a new advertisement for that program with a mandatory assignment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To select the "Run Once For Every User Who Logs On" option for your new program,
follow these steps:

1. From the Systems Management Server Administrator console, navigate to
  Packages.

2. Click Programs, and then select "Program properties" for the program you
  created.

3. On the Advanced tab of the "Program properties", click "When Program Is
  Assigned".

Note: The options available for "When Program Is Assigned" are valid only if the
corresponding advertisement has a mandatory assignment on the Schedule tab of
"Advertisement properties".
