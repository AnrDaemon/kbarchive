SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up Microsoft Exchange View-Only
Administrators. This is useful if you want to include users in your organization
who can run the Exchange Administrator program without having permission to
modify any object in the Microsoft Exchange organization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up Microsoft Exchange View-Only Administrators, follow these steps:

1. Determine which domain users will have View-Only rights. Anyone in the Domain
  Users group is eligible. Permissions belonging to Domain Administrators are
  not needed.

  NOTE: If you want a user to run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program
  at the Microsoft Exchange Server computer itself, you need to assign the "Log
  on locally" Windows NT user right. This user right is not granted by default
  to the Domains Users group.

2. Log on as an Administrator and run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
  program.

3. Make sure the Permissions tab is visible for all objects. To do this:

  a. From the Tools menu, click Options.

  b. Click the Permissions tab.

  c. Check the "Show Permissions page for all objects" and "Display rights for
     roles on Permissions page" options.

  d. Click OK.

4. From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, click the site where you
  want to set up the View-Only Administrator, and then select Properties from
  the File menu.

5. Click the Add button in the Permissions tab.

6. In the Add Users and Groups window, add the user(s) you want to have
  View-Only Administrative permissions. Then click OK to return to the Site
  Properties window.

  NOTE: Any regular user with a valid Windows NT account can be selected. You do
  not need to select a user account with Exchange Administrative permissions.

7. In the "Windows NT accounts with permissions" dialog box, select the user(s)
  you added in the previous step and click "View Only Admin" in the Roles
  dropdown list. If "View Only Admin" Does not appear in the list, unmark all
  checked boxes except the "Logon Rights" in the Rights box. The Roles option
  should read "View Only Admin" now.

8. Click OK to close the Site Properties window.

The selected Microsoft Exchange users can now run the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program and perform monitoring tasks, such as watching Link or
Server Monitor Status. These users will not be able to add, delete, or modify
any object in the Microsoft Exchange organization.
