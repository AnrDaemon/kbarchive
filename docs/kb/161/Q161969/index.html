-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Service Pack 5 (SP5) for Windows NT version 3.51 or Service
Pack 2 (SP2) or 3 (SP3) for Windows NT version 4.0, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

- There was an error writing to the IP address.

  -or-

- Unexpected Network Error

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a line printer remote (LPR) printing device does not
respond for 15 minutes. A debug timer is being set for 15 minutes of no
connection to the printer.

An LPR printing device may stop responding if the printer is out of paper or if
it is taken offline.

This error can also happen if the host name fails to resolve to an IP address.
The fix referenced below does not take care of this issue. This issue can be
worked around by providing a proper host name resolution method, such as DNS or
HOSTS file.

For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem and resume printing, clear the dialog box at the
server.

please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
