-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Windows NT 4.0 on a Toshiba laptop computer, you may receive
error messages involving the Scivdd.dll file when you start your computer. These
error messages may be similar to:

  X m. An installable Virtual Device Driver Failed Dll initialization.

  16 bit Windows Subsystem
  Hidden Console of WOW VDM
  An installable Virtual Device Driver failed Dll initialization. Choose 'Close'
  to terminate the application.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you installed Windows NT in any folder other than the
&lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt folder when you install the Toshiba utilities. The problem
is caused by the SCI drivers. The Advanced Power Management (APM) subsystem from
Toshiba by itself does not cause the problem.

The SCI drivers are used by the 16-bit utilities that allow you to modify the
BIOS settings. The 16-bit utilities that require the Scivdd.dll file are the
Toshiba Hardware Setup and Max Time Manager utilities.

You can avoid installing the SCI drivers during Setup by clicking cancel for the
SCI drivers installation during the Toshiba utilities installation process.

The problem occurs because the Scivdd.dll file is hard coded to look for other
DLLs in the Winnt\System32 folder. When they are not found, the DLL does not
load and you receive the error message.


RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Toshiba for more information regarding this product.

A possible workaround is to create a &lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt folder and copy all the
SCI related DLLs to this folder in the same structure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

not only character-based programs, but 16-bit Windows-based programs as well.
