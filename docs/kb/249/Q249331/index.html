-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advertisements targeted at Secondary Site Client Collections are not modified to
reflect the deltas in the target collection. Therefore, advertisements may still
be available to clients that you have removed from the intended target
collection.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Secondary Site Collection Evaluator does not correctly
handle a collection member delta. This prevents Offer Manager on the Secondary
Site from finding out a collection member has been removed from a collection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 SP1. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hotfix listed in this article is a preventative fix that stops the problem
from occurring in the future. However, the hotfix is not corrective. If you
suspect you already have the problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to discuss options to resolve the current symptoms before you apply this
hotfix.

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on your Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Stop the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE services.

2. Copy the updated Basesvr.dll file to the SMS\Bin\I386 folder.
