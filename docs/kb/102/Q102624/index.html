The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1,3.5,3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1,3.5,3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Setup allows you to install a single pointing device. If you later
use Setup to change to another pointing device, the first pointing device is
disabled.

This can present a problem, especially for users with portable machines that use
one mouse type when the machine is in a docking station and a different mouse
type when not in the docking station.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have mouse support in only one of your machine's configurations, do the
following:

1. Make sure both drivers are present on the machine. Setup never deletes driver
  files. Once you run Setup and select Mouse Port Mouse to install drivers,
  they remain on the machine until you explicitly delete them from the DRIVERS
  directory.

2. In Control Panel, choose the Devices icon, and make sure all relevant mouse
  drivers are marked with the System startup type (use the Startup button if
  necessary). The following table lists the mouse types and corresponding
  drivers for those drivers Microsoft supplies:

     Mouse Type                                        Driver
     ----------------------------------------------------------

     Microsoft Mouse Port Mouse (includes BallPoint)   i8042prt
     Logitech Mouse Port Mouse                         i8042prt
     Microsoft InPort Bus Mouse                        inport
     Microsoft Serial Mouse                            sermouse
     Microsoft BallPoint Serial Mouse                  sermouse
     Logitech Serial Mouse                             sermouse
     Microsoft (green buttons) or Logitech Bus Mouse   busmouse

For the Compaq LTE and other machines in which one configuration involves a
Microsoft Mouse Port Mouse (also known as a PS/2-compatible mouse), the solution
is even simpler. The keyboard and PS/2-compatible mouse share a driver;
therefore, the Mouse Port Mouse support is available without additional charge
if you install the other mouse type (usually serial) during Setup, everything
will work from then on with no further intervention.
