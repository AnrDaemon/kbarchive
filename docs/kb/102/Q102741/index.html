-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This articles discusses the differences between the guest account on a
Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for Macintosh, and the
Guest logon option that Macintosh users may choose when attempting to
log on to a Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for Macintosh.

The guest account on a Windows NT Advanced Server is different from
the Guest logon option for Macintosh. When a Macintosh user attempts
to log on to a Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for
Macintosh, and that user selects the Guest option, that user is not
logged on to the Windows NT Advanced Server as the guest account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Macintosh user selects the Guest option during logon, the MacFile Control
Panel reports the following when displaying the Users connected:

Connected Users      Computers
&lt;Guest&gt;              &lt;Unknown&gt;

In this case, the Macintosh is not logged with any user account the Windows NT
Advanced Server has.

When a Macintosh user selects the Registered User option and uses the user name
"Guest," the MacFile Control Panel reports the following when displaying the
Users connected:

Connected Users      Computers
&lt;Guest&gt;              &lt;Unknown&gt;

In this case, the Macintosh is logged on to the Windows NT Advanced Server as
that computer's guest, and therefore has the permissions of the guest account.

The difference, as displayed, is the missing greater-than and less-than ("&gt;"
and "&lt;") signs. The difference, effectually, is that the Macintosh Guest is
not the same as the guest account; they are similar in name only.

To disable a Macintosh user from logging on to the Windows NT Advanced Server as
a Guest (as opposed to as the guest account), the Allow Guests To Logon check
box in the Security box of the MacFile Attributes dialog box must be clear (that
is, not checked).

To disable a Macintosh user from logging on to the Windows NT Advanced Server as
the guest account, the guest account itself must be disabled. This makes it so
no user, from any computer, can use the guest account.

Another option to deny the guest account access from a Macintosh is to limit the
guest account to log on only from certain named computers. This can be done in
the Logon From box, which can be accessed by choosing User Properties from the
User Manager.

The permissions of the guest account is set by the User Manager. The permissions
for the guest logon option is dependent upon the Everyone setting under
Permissions from the MacFile menu in File Manager. Note that the Macintosh
permission structure differs from the Windows NT permission structure.
