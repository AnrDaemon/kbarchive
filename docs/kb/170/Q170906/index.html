- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a document in Microsoft Word 97 with the Widow/Orphan Control
setting turned on and then save it in the Microsoft Word 6.0/95 format or in
Rich Text Format (RTF), none of the paragraphs will be formatted with
Widow/Orphan control setting when you open it in Microsoft Word 6.x.

CAUSE
=====

When Microsoft Word 97 writes out the RTF code for the Widow/Orphan Control
setting, Microsoft Word 6.x only partially understands the code and does not
apply the Widow/Orphan Control setting to any of the paragraphs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

To work around this problem, once you open the document in Microsoft Word 6.x,
you can reapply the Widow/Orphan Control setting to the appropriate paragraphs.
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select the text to which you want to apply the Widow/Orphan Control setting.

2. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

3. Click the Text Flow tab.

4. Under Pagination, click to select Widow/Orphan Control.

5. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q172475 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable or disable the Widow/Orphan Control setting in Microsoft Word 97,
follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

2. Click the Line And Page Breaks tab.

3. Click to select (enable) or to clear (disable) the Widow/Orphan Control check
  box.

Widow (the last line of a paragraph) control prevents a line from being printed
by itself at the top of a page. It also prevents an orphan (the first line of a
paragraph) from being printed by itself at the bottom of a page. Widow/Orphan
Control should be turned off if every page must have the same number of lines.

Widow/Orphan control is not applied to paragraphs that have three lines or fewer.
An alternative for this situation is to use the Keep Paragraph Together option
(on the Format menu, click Paragraph and then click the Text Flow or Line And
Page Breaks tab) which keeps the paragraph from being split between pages.
