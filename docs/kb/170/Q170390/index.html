-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following error is displayed when trying to exit the SNA Server Admin
Security options under SNA Server 2.11 when it is running on a MIPS system.

  Error: 4116

  An error occurred at the server in attempting to process your request.
  Your changes may not have been applied.

This problem occurs on both the Japanese and U.S. versions of SNA Server 2.11
when running on a MIPS system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused because of a structure member alignment problem with SNA
Server 2.11 when running on a MIPS system. Because the structure member is
passed across the network, it could not be aligned correctly. The result is that
a new security structure is allocated and the misaligned member structure is
copied into it before the Windows NT security call is made. This results in the
4116 error.


RESOLUTION
==========

The security component of the SnaBase service has been updated to correct this
problem. In addition, ACL caching is no longer done when SNA Server 2.11 is used
on a MIPS system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
