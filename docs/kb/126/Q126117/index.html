SYMPTOMS
========

When you dock or undock your computer it no longer operates properly. For
example, your keyboard or mouse stops working.

CAUSE
=====

Your computer does not have a Plug and Play BIOS. Your computer must have a Plug
and Play BIOS to support hot or warm docking and undocking.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must turn your computer off before you dock or undock it if the computer
does not have a Plug and Play BIOS. You may want to contact your computer's
manufacturer about upgrading the BIOS to a Plug and Play version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Hot docking and undocking refers to inserting the computer in the docking
station or removing it from the docking station while the computer is running at
full power. Warm docking refers to docking or undocking the computer while it is
in suspended mode. Laptop or portable computers with a Plug and Play BIOS can be
hot or warm docked and undocked.

Some computer manufacturers will not supply a Plug and Play BIOS for certain
computer models. For example, Toshiba has stated that it will not provide a Plug
and Play BIOS for T4600 laptop computers.
