The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the QuickTime for Windows installation program, you may receive the
following error message:

  This application uses Ctl3d32.dll, which is not the correct version. This
  version of Ctl3d32.dll is designed only for Windows NT systems.

If you click OK, the QuickTime installation program continues to run without
further problems. All Bookshelf 98 features that use QuickTime, such as the 360
degree views, function properly, and the error message does not reappear unless
you remove and reinstall QuickTime.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the version of the Ctl3d32.dll file on your computer
is incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this error message from reappearing, delete all copies of the
Ctl3d32.dll file from your hard drive. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "ctl3d32.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Find Now.

3. In the list of found files, right-click each Ctl3d32.dll file, and then click
  Delete. Continue until the list of found files is empty.

4. Close the Find: Files Named Ctl3d32.dll window, and then restart the
  computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ctl3d32.dll file is not installed by Bookshelf or by Windows 95, and is not
used by QuickTime for Windows.

QuickTime is manufactured by Apple Computer Corporation, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
