-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Exchange Service may stop responding and the Service Control Manager
reports an error when it tries to modify that service's state. If you cannot use
the Services (in Control Panel) to stop the service and are unable to change the
Startup Type of the service, you can change how that service starts by editing
the registry. All Exchange services should be set to manual until you determine
the cause of the hung state.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the Startup Type of a service in this condition you can modify the
registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe). Select each of the following subkeys that
your computer has and modify them one at a time.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \MSExchangeCCMC
  \MSExchangeDS
  \MSExchangeDX
  \MSExchangeFB
  \MSExchangeIMC
  \MSExchangeINS
  \MSExchangeIS
  \MSExchangeMSMI
  \MSExchangeMTA
  \MSExchangePCMTA
  \MSExchangeSA
  \MSExchangeWEB

Change the following in the right pane:

  Value Name: Start
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Data: 3 (Default: 2)

Data values are as follows:

  0 = Boot
  1 = System
  2 = Automatic
  3 = Manual
  4 = Disabled

After the value for Start has been set to Manual, you can shut down the computer.
This will stop the service that was not responding and allow you to troubleshoot
the cause of the problem.
