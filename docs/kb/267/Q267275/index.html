SYMPTOMS
========

When you create new collections at a parent site and replicate the collections
to child sites, you may not be able to view all of the lines in the Comment box
from the child site.

For example, if a Comment box for a collection at the parent site includes the
following text

  this is line one (user presses ENTER for the next line)
  this is line two

the Comment box for the collection only shows the following first line when you
replicate the collection and view it from a child site:

  this is line one

NOTE: This bug also causes the collection schedule information not to replicate
on the downstream servers and causes the collection flag to be incorrectly set
to "0" at the child sites.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use only single-line entries in the Comment box of
collection definitions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
