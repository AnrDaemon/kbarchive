The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Command Clean (Cmdclean.exe) utility to clean a Systems
Management Server (SMS) database, history records are not properly removed if
the computer's time is set to a date after 12/31/1999.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language version of this software should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date        Time    Size    File name     Platform  Version
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  05/10/2000  4:53pm  29,504  Cmdclean.exe  Intel     1.2.0.0
  05/10/2000  4:53pm  40,208  Cmdclean.exe  Alpha     1.2.0.0

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

You can clean history records from an SMS site manually. To do so:

1. Start the SMS Administrator console.

2. Click the Sites window.

3. On the Edit menu, click Delete Special.

4. In the Delete box, click "Machine history records".

5. Set the appropriate date range by using either the Dated Before or Older Than
  boxes.

6. Click OK to begin deletion.

It is a good idea to delete aged history records as part of regular site
maintenance.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Command Clean utility for
Systems Management Server version 1.2.
