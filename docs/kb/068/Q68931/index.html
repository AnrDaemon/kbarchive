The Microsoft Mouse can be successfully used with the application Open
Access III by performing the following steps:

1. Copy the Open Access III files MMENU.DEF and MMENU.MNU to the
   MOUSE1 subdirectory.

2. Copy the file MENU.COM to the MOUSE1 subdirectory.

3. Load the Microsoft Mouse driver.

4. Go to the MOUSE1 subdirectory and type:

      MENU MMENU

   You should get a "Menu Installed" message.

5. Go to the Open Access III subdirectory and start the Open Access
   III program.

If this sequence does not work, you may have problems with memory
resident software. In which case, perform the above steps after doing a
"clean boot" with a copy of the original DOS floppy disk.

You may obtain the MENU.COM program by calling Microsoft Product
Support (Hardware).

Open Access III is an integrated function application that combines a
database, a word processor, and a spreadsheet into one application.
The product is developed and marketed by Software Products
International. The technical support number is (800) 937-4774.

The Software Products International product referenced here is
