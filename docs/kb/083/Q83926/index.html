SUMMARY
=======

The licensing policy for the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 is
different from the licensing policy for Windows 3.0. The Windows 3.1 licensing
agreement allows for only one installation per license.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under the licensing agreements for Microsoft applications software and Windows
3.0, if the software is permanently installed on the hard disk or other storage
device of a computer (other than a network server) and one person uses that
computer more than 80 percent of the time it is in use, then that person may
also use the software on a portable or home computer.

However, Windows 3.1 is considered systems software and therefore follows the
same licensing agreement as MS-DOS (that is, you must purchase one copy of the
software for each machine).

The following is a copy from Grant of License section of Windows 3.1 license
card:

  Grant of License. Microsoft grants to you the right to use one copy of the
  enclosed Microsoft software program (the "SOFTWARE") on a single computer.
  The SOFTWARE is in "use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary
  memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g., hard disk,
  CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that computer. However, installation on a
  network server for the sole purpose of distribution to one or more other
  computer(s) shall not constitute "use" for which a separate license is
  required.

All Microsoft license agreements are version-specific, meaning that they apply
only to the version of the product that you acquired with the license. If you
upgrade from Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1, you only have one license for Windows.
The Windows 3.1 license replaces the Windows 3.0 license.
