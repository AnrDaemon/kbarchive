-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For compatibility with MS-DOS version 5.0 or later, you need version 4.7 or
later of the Bernoulli driver. If your Bernoulli driver is earlier than 4.7, it
may lock the machine during startup.

MS-DOS 5.0 or later cannot load the Bernoulli driver high unless version 7.0 or
later is used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Version 7.0 of the Bernoulli driver is the latest driver available from IOMEGA.
This driver requires a model PC2, PC2B, or PC4B Bernoulli adapter card. If you
have an earlier model of the adapter card, you can upgrade by contacting
IOMEGA.

If you have the correct adapter card and boot your machine from the Bernoulli
drive, you will need to obtain a kit from IOMEGA that includes version 7.0 of
the driver, a manual, and an EPROM chip. If you have the correct adapter card
but do not boot from the Bernoulli drive, you will only need to obtain version
7.0 of the driver and the manual from IOMEGA. The new 7.0 driver is available
from IOMEGA customer support or by calling their bulletin board and downloading
700.ZIP and 700.EXE.

Version 5.2 of the Bernoulli driver for the PC3B adapter is available from IOMEGA
customer support. Version 5.2 is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0 and later as long as
it is not loaded high.

For more information on any of the above products, call IOMEGA at one of the
numbers below.

make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
