  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Exchange Server system attendant performs a routing
calculation, the following event may be logged in the Microsoft Windows NT Event
Viewer application event log:

  Event ID: 5000
  Type: Error
  Source: MSExchangeSA
  Description: Recalculation of the routing table is complete. Result: The
  message transfer agent (MTA) information in the Windows NT registry appears to
  be corrupted.
  Take steps to repair or restore the registry entries for the MTA.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the message transfer agent (MTA) is missing a crucial
registry entry that defines its own X.500 Distinguished Name (DN).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Add the missing registry entry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/MSExchangeMTA/Parameters

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value

  Value Name: X500DN
  Data Type: REG_SZ:
  Value:
  /o=&lt;organization&gt;/ou=&lt;site&gt;/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=&lt;server_name&gt;/cn=Microsoft
  MTA

     where &lt;organization&gt; is your correct organization name, &lt;site&gt;
     is your correct site name, and &lt;server_name&gt; is the correct name of
     the Exchange Server computer.

  d. Quit Registry Editor.

2. Stop and start the Exchange Server MTA services.

3. Recalculate your site routing:

  a. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click to expand the Site
     object, click Configuration, and double-click the Site Addressing object
     to open its properties.

  b. Click the Routing tab, and then click Recalculate Routing. The following
     message is displayed:

  It will take several minutes for the new routing information to be replicated
  across your site and then take effect.

  c. Check the Event Viewer application event log and wait for the following
     event to be logged:

  Event ID: 5000
  Source: MSExchangeSA
  Type: Information
  Category: General
  Description: Recalculation of the routing table is Complete. Result: The
  operation has completed successfully.
