-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX version 2.0 Administrator
tool, you may receive the following error message:

  Internet Explorer Script Error

  An error has occurred in the script on this page.

  Line: 60
  Char: 5
  Error: Automation server can't create object
  Code: 0
  URL: file://C:\Program Files\UnixSvcs\Admin\About.htm

  Do you want to continue running scripts on this page?

NOTE: The information in the URL line of the error message is the path to the
script, and varies depending on your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you install Services for UNIX in a folder whose name
contains a space or spaces. This also occurs if the folder name contain a tilde
(~) character.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install Services for UNIX in a folder whose name does not
contain a space, for example, C:\Sfu, or a tilde (~) character.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can easily detect this problem by reviewing the URL value in the error
message. For example:

  C:\Program Files\UnixSvcs\Admin\About.htm

The Program Files folder name contains a space and causes the error message.

This behavior is also described in the Services for UNIX 2.0 Readme.txt file:

  Special Requirements and Alerts

  Install this software in a directory that does not include a space (or tilde)
  in its name. If you do install this software in a directory that has a space
  (or tilde) in its name, some shortcuts cannot work correctly. In addition,
  you may experience problems with Network File System (NFS), some UNIX
  utilities, and scripts.
