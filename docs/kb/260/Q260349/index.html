The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server routing objects have six intrinsic actions:

- AndSplit
- Goto
- New
- OrSplit
- Wait
- Terminate

A Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) document describes the Terminate action as
follows:

  

  Action        Parameter   Description
  Terminate     (None)      Ends the currently executing process instance.

This means that Terminate action ends the currently running process instance,
takes no parameters, and can occur anywhere in your routing map.

However, these examples show different ways to use Terminate action:

  Terminate 0   0

-and-

  Terminate 0   1

What do these examples mean? What is the difference for the parameter 0/1 that is
passed to the Terminate action?

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a documentation error in MSDN. Terminate action can take one parameter:
0 (which is the same as the default no parameter) or 1.

The parameter

  Terminate 0

-or-

  Terminate 0   0

means that the routing ends the currently executing process instance.

The parameter

  Terminate 0   1

means that the routing ends the currently executing process instance and deletes
the currently running process instance from the folder where the message is
posted for routing.

Additional query words: Event Scripting Agent Routing Objects
