-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log off, the logoff process begins but may stop responding (hang). When
this occurs, the client workstation is fully accessible from the network; you
can access the workstation by using the ping or net use command. However,
pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE on the workstation does not display the Security dialog
box. You must reboot the workstation to log on again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the user profiles are stored on an AS/400 system
(which is a Server Message Block, or SMB, server), and the MAXMUX value is set
to 1 on the AS/400 SMB server. In Windows NT, the MAXMUX value is listed as the
Max MPX Requests setting. The workstation's redirector is blocked from running
several threads until a resource that is currently in a deadlocked state is
released. This may be the result of a race condition among several threads.

RESOLUTION
==========

Increase the value on the server to a higher number, or possibly slow down the
workstation's redirector to avoid the race condition.
