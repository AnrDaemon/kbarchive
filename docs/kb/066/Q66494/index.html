SUMMARY
=======

The explanation of errors R2701 through R2709 is "Internal error," and the user
is directed to contact Microsoft Product Support Services for clarification.
This article contains information on these internal errors.

MORE INFORMATION
================


The list is:

  R2701: Creation of title b-tree has failed
  R2703: Creation of bitmap file has failed.

These two file creation failures can happen due to low memory, low disk space, or
lack of file handles.

  R2705: Phrase file does not exist.

This error is given if the phrase file mysteriously disappears between the time
it was created (or checked for existence) and when it is used. It might be
caused by low disk space, or from compiling on the network.

  R2707: Closing of file has failed.

This is a disk error that is not out of memory, out of disk space, or out of file
handles. It might indicate hard disk problems such as bad sectors, or too many
files in one directory.

  R2709: Opening output system file failed.

If someone does encounter this error, they are using an old Beta version.
