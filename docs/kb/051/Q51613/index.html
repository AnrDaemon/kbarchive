Question:

I am using the /Gm switch to move near string constants into the
_CONST segment, but it doesn't seem to work properly. My program is
shown below:

   char foo[] = "hello";

   void main(void)
   {
   }

When I examine the map file generated, it tells me that foo is stored
in _DATA. Why isn't the string constant "hello" being stored in
_CONST?

Response:

The /Gm switch is behaving as it should. In the above case, the string
constant "hello" is not stored as a constant, it is merely a shorthand
way of initializing the array foo. For example,

   char foo[] = "hello";

is equivalent to saying the following:

   char foo[] = {'h','e','l','l','o','\0'};

The data in the array foo is not a string constant, and therefore,
should not be moved to the _CONST section with the /Gm switch.

The following code demonstrates a few string constants:

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main(void)
   {
       char array[] = "This is NOT a string constant.";

       char *foo = "This would be moved out to _CONST with /Gm";
       printf("This string will be moved to _CONST\n");
    }
</code></pre></div></div>
