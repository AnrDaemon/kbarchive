SYMPTOMS
========

Large documents that contain a contiguous range of paragraphs that are formatted
with any type of paragraph numbering, scroll slowly in Word. Line numbering also
affects the speed of scrolling through the document; however, the impact is not
as great as with paragraph numbering.

CAUSE
=====

Because Word automatically updates numbers in a list, Word begins its count at
the first number in the list and continues to the number that appears at the top
or bottom of the screen, depending on the direction you are scrolling. The rate
of speed at which the scrolling becomes slower varies with each system; however,
contiguous ranges of approximately 100 numbered paragraphs generally mark the
point at which the speed begins to gradually slow down.

This problem occurs with paragraphs formatted by clicking Bullets And Numbering
on the Format menu as well as the Numbering button on the Toolbar, regardless of
the numbering type (that is, multi-level, Arabic numbers, Roman numerals, or
alphabetic formats).

WORKAROUND
==========

If the numbering is not contiguous or is interrupted, scrolling speed returns
until approximately 100 numbered paragraphs appear, at which time the scrolling
speed begins to gradually slow down. To interrupt numbering, click Stop
Numbering on the shortcut menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
