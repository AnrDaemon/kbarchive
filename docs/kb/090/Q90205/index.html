The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
- Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may notice that Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections operates
slowly for no apparent reason when connected to a large network even if you do
not have any network sessions running. This is due to the amount of network
traffic on a large network and the protocol NetBEUI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under NetBEUI, if one computer wants to communicate with another, it transmits a
broadcast packet to determine where the other computer is. Each computer on the
network must examine this packet. On a large network, this equates to almost
constant packet examination by all members of the network.

There is no solution to this inconvenience. Disabling the network adapter
connection stops the speed degradation, but does not allow you to access the
network.
