-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you set up and share a workgroup post office (WGPO) with full access and a
full-access password on a Windows for Workgroups network, you can connect to the
WGPO only one time on a client machine that has the Reconnect At Startup and
Ghosted Connections options selected. Subsequent attempts to connect to the WGPO
after exiting and signing out of Mail and quitting and restarting Windows
generate the following error message:

  Cannot Connect to Workgroup Postoffice

CAUSE
=====

When you are connected to the remote WGPO in File Manager with a password and
the Reconnect At Startup and Ghosted Connections options selected, no physical
connection to the WGPO is established. The Mail client cannot locate the Mail
server, and you receive the above error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. In File Manager on the client, disconnect from the WGPO located on the mail
  server.

2. Delete or rename the MSMAIL.INI file on the local machine. Start Microsoft
  Mail and connect to an existing post office. Enter the WGPO password when
  prompted.

These steps correct the serverpath= setting in the MSMAIL.INI file, allowing you
to connect to the WGPO normally.
