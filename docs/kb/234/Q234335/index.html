-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remotely control a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
client that has a mouse filter driver installed and running, mouse functionality
may not be present for the user who initiates the remote control session. When
this occurs, the mouse pointer is in a fixed position and does not move.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a conflict between the drivers that control the SMS
remote control functionality and the mouse filter driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, disable or uninstall the mouse filter driver. For
information about how to do so, please consult the mouse filter driver's
documentation or manufacturer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
