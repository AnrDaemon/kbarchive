-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you call the LoadPicture function from within a Visual FoxPro .app or .exe
program, and you use a file name that is the same as one that is included in the
project, you may receive the following OLE error:

  OLE error code 0x800a01e1: Unknown COM status code.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro first looks at the files that are included in the project, and
then calls application programming interfaces (APIs) that do not handle embedded
files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change file names so that the LoadPicture function is not called with names that
are included in the project. You can do this manually by using different names
for your files, or programmatically at run time by using code like the
following:

  LOCAL lcOldFile, lcNewFile
  lcOldFile = "D:\graphics\picture1.bmp"
  lcNewFile = JUSTPATH(lcOldFile) + SYS(3) + ".bmp"
  RENAME (lcOldFile) TO (lcNewFile)
  x = LOADPICTURE(lcNewFile)
  RENAME (lcNewFile) TO (lcOldFile)

NOTE: The JUSTPATH function was introduced in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an empty project named Test.

2. Add a new program that contains the following line of code to the project:

  x = LOADPICTURE(GETFILE())

3. Add a bitmap named Picture1.bmp to the project.

4. Build the project to an executable named Test.exe.

5. Copy both Test.exe and Picture1.bmp to a test folder, and then run Test.exe.

6. When prompted, select Picuture1.bmp. You should received the OLE error that
  is shown in the "Symptoms" section.
