The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When specifying multiple files in the File Collection tab in Software Inventory,
System Management Server 2.0 searches the entire drive for these files and they
DO NOT have to be in the same directory, as with Systems Management Server 1.x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Systems Management Server version 1.x, if you create an Inventory Package to
search for multiple files that exist in the same directory on the client,
Systems Management Server 1.x only reports the first file that is found. This
occurs regardless of the search logic and makes no difference whether you use
the "AND" operator or the "OR" operator. In addition, Software Inventory does
not continue to search the directory for other files that have been defined. If
multiple files are present, only the first file defined in the Software
Inventory package will be displayed in the client's Packages icon in Personal
Computer Properties.

In Systems Management Server version 2.0, if you click the New icon in the File
Collection tab from the Software Inventory Client Agent properties screen, you
can type the exact file names (such as Autoexec.bat) or you can use wildcards
and collect all files of a certain extension (such as *.ini). Systems Management
Server 2.0 searches the entire hard disk for these files and collects all
instances of them.

Systems Management Server generates a resource ID for the collected files by the
order in which they were added to the database; this is purely sequential. The
collected files are then placed in a directory on the site server that matches
the following resource ID:

  SMS\Inboxes\Sinv.box\File.col\\&lt;ResourceID&gt;
