The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot convert Creative Writer or Fine Artist documents to Microsoft Word
97. In addition, you cannot import Ghost Mysteries for Creative Writer files
into Word 97.

CAUSE
=====

Word does not provide conversion filters for Creative Writer and Fine Artist
documents. In addition, there is no filter for the Creative Writer add-on Ghost
Mysteries for Creative Writers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To convert a Creative Writer or Fine Artist document, use either of the
following methods.

Method 1
--------

Copy and paste the Creative Writer or Fine Artist document into Word, and then
save the file as a Word document. This method retains all text and graphics.

Method 2
--------

In Creative Writer or Fine Artist, save the document as Text Only, and then open
the document in Word 97. The drawback to this method is that graphics are not
converted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creative Writer documents are saved in a proprietary format called RIFF
(Resource Interchange File Format). These files can be transferred between
Windows and Macintosh versions of Creative Writer without any translation. You
can save the text of Creative Writer documents in the text-only format and open
the text file in other programs.
