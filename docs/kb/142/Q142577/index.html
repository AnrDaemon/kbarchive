-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Schedule+, version 7.0, if you use Reply to All in
response to a scheduled appointment it will not include the Resources
attendee(s).

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When creating appointments there are three types of attendees you can invite:
Required, Optional, and Resources. An invitation to a scheduled meeting is
addressed to (To) the Required attendees, Carbon Copied (Cc) to the Optional
attendees, and Blind carbon copied (Bcc) to the Resources attendees. As with
regular messages, a Reply to All will not include Bcc recipients (resources)
included on the original message.

Steps To Reproduce:

1. Create an appointment while logged in as &lt;User1&gt;.

2. Invite at least 1 attendee for each of the following fields: Required,
  Optional, and Resources.

3. Send the appointment request.

4. Log on as Required attendee or Optional attendee.

5. Open the appointment request.

6. Choose Compose, Reply to All.

7. Send the appointment request.

Result: If you logged on as the Required attendee, the message is addressed To
&lt;User1&gt; and Cc'ed to the Optional attendee. If you logged on as the
Optional attendee, the message is addressed To &lt;User1&gt; and the Required
attendee. In either case, the Resources attendee is not included as a recipient
of the Reply to All message.
