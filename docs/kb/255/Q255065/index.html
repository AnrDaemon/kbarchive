SYMPTOMS
========

When you are printing with the Generic Text-Only driver and you are using the
Continuous-No Page Break paper source, using 0 (zero) for the top and bottom
margins causes the first line on a page to be printed on top of the last line of
the previous page.

CAUSE
=====

Because each page of a print job uses a form feed (FF) control to advance to the
next page, the printer driver does not send a line feed (LF) at the end of the
last line of text on the page. When you are using the Continuous-No Page Break
paper source for the Generic Text-Only driver, the FF to advance to the next
page is not used. If the bottom and top margins are 0 (zero), the lack of a FF
or LF means that the first line of text on the next page starts printing on the
same line as the last line of text printed on the previous page.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set a top margin size that is equivalent to the space that a line of text
occupies. This causes the first line of text on a page to be printed directly
under the last line printed from the previous page.
