SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a file with a .wri extension from cc:Mail version 2.1, WordPad
starts automatically, and the cc:Mail window is minimized, but you are unable to
restore the cc:Mail window after closing WordPad.

CAUSE
=====

When you run a .wri file from cc:Mail, cc:Mail attempts to run the program that
the .wri extension is associated with, and the cc:Mail window is minimized. Even
after you upgrade to Windows 95, the following line, found in the [extensions]
section of the Win.ini file, causes .wri files to be associated with Write.exe:

     wri=write.exe ^.wri

However, in Windows 95, Write.exe has been replaced with a program stub that
starts WordPad (Wordpad.exe). Therefore, when you open a .wri file from cc:Mail
in Windows 95, Write.exe starts, which in turn starts WordPad. When you then
quit WordPad, the Write.exe stub remains in memory. Because the original program
run from cc:Mail, Write.exe, has not been closed, the cc:Mail window is not
automatically restored. In fact, the cc:Mail window cannot be restored until the
Write.exe program is closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the [extensions] section of the Win.ini file so that the line that reads

     wri=write.exe ^.wri

reads:

     wri=c:\progra~1\access~1\wordpad.exe ^.wri

NOTE: Changing the program that .wri files are associated with in Windows
Explorer does not correct this problem.
