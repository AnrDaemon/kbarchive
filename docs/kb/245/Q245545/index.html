-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange Notes Connector, two processes
in the Exchange Connectivity Administrator do not start, and the browse logs
have an entry that shows the following:

  LME-NOTES-NTSMEX(0130) 1 41220:Error: no Notes Session Open

CAUSE
=====

The connector account is not connected to the Lotus Notes server, for either of
the following reasons:

- Cause 1. The Notes.ini file that the connector is configured to use does not
  point to the Connector.id file.

- Cause 2. Connectivity cannot be established to the Notes server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve Cause 1, ensure that the Notes.ini file is referring to the
Connector.id file:

1. Open the properties for the Exchange Notes Connector and click the Advanced
  tab.

2. Open the Notes.ini file indicated in the "Notes INI file location" field, and
  check for a line of text containing "keyfilename=". Make sure that this line
  refers to the correct .id file for the connector.

To resolve Cause 2, verify that a regular Notes client can connect to the
server.

In both cases, you can use the "show users" command from the Notes server console
window to return a listing of users currently connected to the Notes server. For
proper connectivity, the connector.id must be connected.

If the Connector.id file is connected and the 41220 message is still written to
the log, make sure that the Connector.id file has proper access rights.
