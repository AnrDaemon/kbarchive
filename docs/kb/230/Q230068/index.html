SYMPTOMS
========

When migrating large Notes mailboxes, using the Microsoft Exchange migration
utility for Lotus Notes, the migration process may not complete. The migration
utility, however, reports that it finished successfully, and the statistics of
migrated data will not be equal to the initial data. For example, a user with
7,000 messages may find statistics that reports success with only 3,500 messages
migrated. This problem may occur with either one-step or two-step migration.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this, use the Microsoft Importer for Lotus Notes Mail. It has a
higher success rate with large notes mailboxes. This tool is available for
download from:

  http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/downloads/2000/NotesImporter.asp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5 for
Service Packs 1 and 2.
