-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows 95 client service pack revision is not reported in Systems
Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2.

The Windows NT client service pack revision is not reported in Systems Management
Server versions 1.0 or 1.1, but is reported correctly in version 1.2.

CAUSE
=====

Currently, Systems Management Server inventory does not check for Windows 95
service packs. The reporting of Windows NT service packs in Systems Management
Server 1.2 is an enhancement.

WORKAROUND
==========

If it is necessary to determine whether clients have a service pack installed,
and Systems Management Server inventory does not report it, the following
procedure may help to produce a machine group of clients who do not have the
service pack:

1. Create an Inventory Package to look for any identifiable service pack file
  (for example, Ntoskrnl.exe 808,256 3/6/96).

2. After the inventory has been updated, run a query against the inventory
  package.

You can then create a machine group from the query results.

For information on creating Inventory Packages, queries, and machine groups,
please refer to your Systems Management Server documentation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
