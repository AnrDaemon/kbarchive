The following NMAKE file does not produce the correct results when
using NMAKE Version 1.00, which is supplied with the Microsoft QuickC
compiler Version 2.00. The file replaces the user-defined macro in the
second command line with the predefined macro in the first command
line. The workarounds are as follows:

1. Remove the "!" at the beginning of the first command line, which
   causes the command to be executed for each dependent file if the
   command uses one of the special macros $? or $**.

2. Do not use a predefined macro for the first command.

3. Do not use the predefined macro $**, a complete list of dependent
   files, for the dependent files in the first command line.

4. Do not use a user-defined macro in the second command line.

5. Update to the Microsoft QuickAssembler package, which is shipped
   with NMAKE Version 1.01, in which this problem is corrected.

More information on the NMAKE utility can be found starting on Page
155 of the "Microsoft QuickC Toolkit" manual. The following is the
NMAKE file that fails:

SOURCE=test.c

test.exe: $(SOURCE)
    !$(CC) $**
    copy $(SOURCE) new

This produces the following output:

cl test.c
copy cl new

The following is the NMAKE file with the first workaround:

SOURCE=test.c

test.exe: $(SOURCE)
    $(CC) $**
    copy $(SOURCE) new

This produces the following correct output:

cl test.c
copy test.c new

The following is the NMAKE file with the second workaround:

SOURCE=test.c

test.exe: $(SOURCE)
    !cl $**
    copy $(SOURCE) new

This also produces the correct output.

The following is the NMAKE file with the third workaround:

SOURCE=test.c

test.exe: $(SOURCE)
    !$(CC) $(SOURCE)
    copy $(SOURCE) new

This also produces the correct output.

The following is the NMAKE file with the fourth workaround:

SOURCE=test.c

test.exe: $(SOURCE)
    !$(CC) $(SOURCE)
    copy test.c new
    copy $(SOURCE) new

This produces the following output:

cl test.c
copy test.c new
copy test.c new
