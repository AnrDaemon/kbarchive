A call to Quarterdeck Office Systems has confirmed that their
Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager (QEMM) driver is responsible for
the following error message reported by several customers:

    Exception #13 at xxxx:xxxx
    Error code 0
    Terminate, Reboot or Continue?

This message indicates that an error was detected by the Quarterdeck
memory manager. This error is essentially the same as a general
protection fault in OS/2 and typically indicates that a stray pointer
is involved.

The error may occur either while the program is executing or after
execution has ended and the program is returning to DOS. A technician
at Quarterdeck stated that they generally use CodeView to track down
such errors, and that while the address printed in the error
diagnostic does not necessarily indicate the precise location of the
error, it does indicate the location at which the error was first
detected.
