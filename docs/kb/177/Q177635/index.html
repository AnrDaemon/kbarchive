SUMMARY
=======

You may need to set up a Microsoft Exchange Server computer to recover
information from the Exchange directory service contained in the Dir.edb file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Dir.edb file is Windows NT machine name specific and thus it can only be
restored to a server with the same computer name.

NOTE: The following steps will allow you to construct a server offline. The
resulting server will not be usable in your production Exchange environment.

Steps to build a Dir.edb recovery server:

1. In the production domain where the Exchange service account resides, install
  a computer as a backup domain controller (BDC) with the same version of
  Microsoft Windows NT Server and service pack level as the production Exchange
  Server computer.

2. Make sure that the recovery server computer has enough free disk space and
  any other devices that are necessary, such as a tape drive or CD-ROM drive.
  Take this computer offline by isolating it from the production network on a
  hub.

3. Promote this server to a primary domain controller (PDC) and reboot the
  computer.

4. Go to Control Panel, and in the Network tool, click the Identification tab.
  In the Network Settings dialog box, click Change button next to the computer
  name. Type the new name in the Computer Name dialog box, and then click OK,
  first verifying that you are not on the production network. Restart the PDC
  for the name change to take effect.

5. Reboot the server. Now the recovery server is running the same version of
  Windows NT Server as the production Exchange Server computer.

6. Install Microsoft Exchange Server as a new site, but use the same
  organization and site name as the production Exchange environment. Make sure
  to select the same service account as the production domain to use for the
  Exchange services.

7. Update to the same service pack level as the production Exchange Server
  computer.

8. Restore from backup the previous Microsoft Exchange directory store and/or
  the Microsoft Exchange information store.
