SUMMARY
=======

When you install Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows on a computer where Microsoft
Word for Windows is installed, you may be able to use features that integrate
the two products.

Due to the design differences between 16-bit and 32-bit programs, 16-bit versions
of Bookshelf can only be integrated with 16-bit versions of Word for Windows,
and 32-bit versions of Bookshelf can only be integrated with 32-bit versions of
Word for Windows.

Because Word 2000, Word 97 for Windows, and Word for Windows 95 are 32-bit
programs, you can only integrate these programs with the following 32-bit
versions of Bookshelf for Windows:

- Bookshelf 2000 for Windows
- Bookshelf 99 for Windows
- Bookshelf 98 for Windows
- Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows
- Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95

Because Word for Windows, versions 6.0 and 2.0, are 16-bit programs, you can only
integrate these programs with the following 16-bit versions of Bookshelf for
Windows:

- Bookshelf for Windows, 1995 Edition (Word for Windows 6.0 only)
- Bookshelf for Windows, 1994 Edition
- Bookshelf for Windows, 1993 Edition
- Bookshelf for Windows, 1992 Edition

  NOTE: Because of integration design changes in the 16-bit version of Bookshelf
  95, you cannot integrate Word for Windows, version 2.0, with any version of
  Bookshelf 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you own the 16-bit version of Bookshelf 95, you can request a copy of the
32-bit version of Bookshelf 95 while supplies last. To do so, dial the following
telephone number:

  (800) 360-7561

You can determine if you have the 16-bit version or the 32-bit version of
Bookshelf 95 by looking at the label on your Bookshelf 95 CD-ROM. The 16-bit
version of Bookshelf 95 has a "Microsoft Windows Compatible" logo on the cover
of the CD-ROM jewel case booklet, and the 32-bit version of Bookshelf 95 has a
"Designed for Windows 95" logo on the cover of the CD-ROM jewel case booklet.
