SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Word for Windows, Word asks you to insert the Bookshelf compact
disc.

CAUSE
=====

Word and Bookshelf work together to display Bookshelf Quote Of The Day or
Bookshelf Daily when you start Word for Windows. These features are provided to
Word by Bookshelf. This is normal behavior, but you can disable it if you
desire.

NOTE: Bookshelf Daily is not provided by Bookshelf 1992, 1993, or the standalone
edition of Bookshelf 1994. Also, please note that this article does not apply to
Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95; these features are not included with the 32-bit
version of Bookshelf 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following methods to disable Quotation Daily or Bookshelf Daily
from automatically starting when you launch Word.

Method 1
--------

1. On the View Menu in Microsoft Word, click either Quote Of The Day, Daily
  Update, or Bookshelf Daily. Note that to complete this task you will need to
  insert the Bookshelf compact disc one last time.

  -or-

  On the Tools menu in Bookshelf 1994 (Office Professional or Word packages
  only), click Bookshelf Daily.

2. In the dialog box that opens, clear the check box next to any of the
  following options to disable it:

  - Display Quotation Daily
  - Display Bookshelf Daily
  - Show Bookshelf Daily At Startup

3. Click OK.

Method 2 - Word And Quote Of The Day
------------------------------------

To disable the Quote Of The Day function, change the [Bookshelf] section of the
Win.ini file so that it reads as follows:

  LastQuote=0

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.

To enable the Quote Of The Day function, change the [Bookshelf] section of the
Win.ini file so that it reads as follows:

  LastQuote=1
