-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Opening a sample script file with the Windows 95 Batch Setup tool (Batch.exe)
may cause unexpected results. The sample scripts included with the Windows 95
Resource Kit and on the Windows 95 CD-ROM cannot be opened in the Batch.exe
tool.

CAUSE
=====

The sample scripts are incompatible with Batch.exe. These scripts are
incomplete, and they contain comments explaining the different sections of the
files.

RESOLUTION
==========

You cannot open the sample scripts with Batch.exe. You can open any file that
was created with Batch.exe itself.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Readme.txt file in the Scripts folder states that you can use any text
editor or Batch.exe to open the sample scripts. However, if you try to open a
sample script with Batch.exe, you receive error messages.

You can use the Windows 95 Batch Setup tool to help automate Windows 95 Setup by
creating an .inf file that is used by Setup. Batch.exe is located in the
Admin\Nettools\Netsetup folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. You can install this
tool using the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. You can also install
Batch.exe as part of the Windows 95 Resource Kit.

The sample scripts are located in the Admin\Reskit\Samples\Scripts folder on the
Windows 95 CD-ROM. You can copy these files to your hard disk. They can also be
installed from the Windows 95 Resource Kit.

REFERENCES
==========

For information about creating batch setup files with Batch.exe, please see the
online Help system in the Windows 95 Batch Setup tool.
