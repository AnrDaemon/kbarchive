-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Internet Mail service that is included with Microsoft
Plus! and you try to use the Remote Mail feature of Microsoft Exchange to
transfer mail or update mail headers, the following error message may be
displayed:

  You could not be logged on to mail server.

  Be sure your account information for the server is accurate. If this problem
  persists, contact your Internet Service Provider.

This problem may occur even when the Internet mail server, account name, and
password that the Internet Mail service is configured to use are correct. In
addition, you may experience any of the following symptoms when you attempt to
transfer mail or update mail headers:

- Messages that you already downloaded and deleted may be downloaded again.

- Microsoft Exchange may not download any new messages, even though you have
  new messages on the server.

- Microsoft Exchange may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

These problems can occur when you attempt to connect to your POP3 mail server
with Microsoft Exchange if you are already running a Windows sockets program
that is connected to the mail server. Microsoft Exchange does not recognize that
another program is already connected to the mail server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before you connect to your Internet mail server with Microsoft Exchange, make
sure that no other program is already connected to the mail server. This
includes third-party mail programs and other Internet connectivity programs that
you use in Windows 95.
