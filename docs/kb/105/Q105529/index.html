- Microsoft Multimedia Mozart, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice some focus anomalies in Mozart when the Help or Glossary windows
are open. For example, if you click the main window or a hotspot (jump) item in
the main window, Mozart will advance to the next page, but the Help or Glossary
window will remain open and in front of the main window. The expected behavior
would be for the Help or Glossary window to be placed behind the main window.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mozart version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the main Mozart screen, choose The Instruments.

2. Progress to page 2 of The Instruments. This page contains three photographs,
  depicting a violin, a cello, and a viola.

3. Press the Help button. The Help window appears, mostly obscuring the main
  Mozart window.

4. Click the exposed part of the violin picture (the picture on the left).

The main Mozart window switches to page 3, but the Help window stays on top. The
Help window should move behind the main Mozart window.

This occurs when the pointer is a hand. You may also notice that if you move the
cursor over the exposed area of a picture, it turns into a hand, and then when
you move it back over the Help window, it remains a hand instead of reverting to
an arrow.
