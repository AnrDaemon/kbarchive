MORE INFORMATION
================

DirectX 6.0 is composed of the following five components:

- Direct3D is used for 3-dimensional rendering.

The new features in Direct3D include:

- Significantly faster performance due to overall improvements in the run-time
  components of Direct3D.

- A completely rewritten geometry engine, which is responsible for transforming
  and lighting operations and includes processor-specific performance
  optimizations that take advantage of features in the latest generation of
  processors.

- All-new software rasterizers, which enable developers to compare the visual
  quality of output on 3-D hardware accelerators to a reference standard.

- Support for many new hardware features, including single-pass multitexturing,
  bump mapping, texture compression, stencil buffers, w-buffers and much more.

DirectPlay
----------

The new features in DirectPlay include:

- New lobbying services.

- Support for firewalls.
