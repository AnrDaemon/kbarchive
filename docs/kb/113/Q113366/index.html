The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0 
- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert text into a card or banner on any page, text always appears in
the upper-left corner of page one, not on the page where you clicked the mouse.

RESOLUTION
==========

To insert text in a banner or a card, do the following:

1. Open a new card or banner.

2. Click the document. A blinking cursor appears in the upper left corner of
  page one. In Creative Writer 2.0, you won't need to click the document for
  the blinking cursor to appear.

3. Press "ENTER" (without the quotation marks) ("RETURN" (without the quotation
  marks) on the Macintosh) until the blinking cursor appears on the page where
  you want to start typing text.

After following the above steps, you will be able to type text anywhere in your
card or banner by just clicking where you want the text to begin.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Paragraph marks (returns) were inserted in the sample cards and banners when
they were created. This gives the illusion that you cannot click anywhere on the
document to add text.

In Creative Writer 1.x, stickers behave differently than text, they can be moved
from page to page with the Transformer Tool, rather than using the ENTER or
RETURN key method.
