The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Apple PowerBook 180C running Microsoft Creative Writer or Fine
Artist for the Macintosh, you may experience random crashes if you are running
Sound Manager, version 2.0.

The PowerBook 180C appears to crash in 1 to 15 minutes while running either
Creative Writer or Fine Artist under Sound Manager 2.0 with sounds enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, choose Sounds Off in the Control Room of Creative
Writer or Fine Artist, as follows (if both applications are running, choose
Sounds Off for both programs):

1. From within the application, press "COMMAND+SHIFT+A" (without the quotation
  marks). This will put you into the Control Room.

2. Click OK in the Control Room dialog box.

3. From the Tools menu, choose Sound Control. Choose Sounds Off.

4. From the File menu, choose Return To Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

After following these steps, the program should run without crashing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, update to Sound Manager version 3.0, which is available
from Apple Computer at (800) 767-2775.
