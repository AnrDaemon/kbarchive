-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you are installing the service pack, a message appears stating that the
MAPI32.dll file is in use by another application and then gives you the options
to Abort, Retry, or Ignore.

If you choose Ignore, the Setup process completes with no other error messages
and gives you the message that the Setup completed. However, when you start the
directory, the clock will continue to turn.

In the Event Viewer Application Log, the most recent events are Event ID 11,
"Database engine stopped", and Event ID 10, "Database engine started". No other
significant events are listed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem usually occurs with the Exchange services when the upgrade
encounters errors during the process, mainly when files involved in the upgrade
are in use. This prevents a graceful upgrade.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure that ONLY the necessary services are running
in Control Panel/Services. Make sure all third-party programs are stopped,
including SNMP, backup software, e-mail clients, virus software, Systems
Management Server, and SQL Server. After this is done, reapply the Exchange
Server Service Pack; it should go through cleanly. After it does, the Exchange
services should start in normal fashion, with a consistent database.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only way to get out of this process is to "kill" it with Kill.exe. Microsoft
recommends not stopping any Microsoft Exchange process while it may be writing
information to the database, for this may lead to inconsistencies in the
database. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services before continuing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The installation of new Service Packs should complete error-free; if not, the
actual messages or pop-up errors should be viewed as important and may indicate
an installation failure.
