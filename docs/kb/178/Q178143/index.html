-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
- Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Repackage option in the Installation Expert or add
script lines manually in the Systems Management Server Installer script editor,
you may receive an access violation error if the script exceeds 8,192 lines
displayed in the script editor. An IPF script file of 1,141,000 bytes contains
approximately 8,192 lines.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Installer has a design limit of 8,192 script line
items imposed in version 1.0. This includes the number of lines in the Mainline
script in combination with the lines from all Include scripts. It may be
difficult to assess how many lines a Repackage is actually adding to a script.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 (Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0). We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an access violation error does occur during a repackage, use the following
steps to troubleshooting the problem:

1. When you attempt to repackage the application again, click the Change button
  on the Repackage Application dialog box to display the Repackage Advance
  Settings dialog box.

2. Attempt to ignore files (or directories) if the application may try to create
  a large number of files.

3. Repackage the application.

If the repackage is successful, use the script editor to modify "Install File(s)"
actions which installs a single file, and where possible, change them to use
wildcards to install multiple files. This will reduce the number of files the
script uses.
