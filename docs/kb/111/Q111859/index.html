Product(s): Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
Version(s): WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): 
Last Modified: 17-DEC-1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you connect to a Novell NetWare or Microsoft LAN Manager server without
establishing a drive letter to that connection, use Schedule+ to open another
user's calendar on that server, and then close that calendar (or exits
Schedule+), the attachment to that server no longer exists.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ does not distinguish between a newly created attachment or universal
naming convention (UNC) style connection and an old, pre-existing connection.
Thus, when you close another user's appointment book or exit Schedule+, the
connection is terminated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure you map a drive letter to your network connection before you open an
appointment book.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 and 1.0a of
Schedule+. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem for NetWare Environments
---------------------------------------------------

1. Log in to a NetWare file server (ServerA, for example).

2. Either in a login script, or from the an MS-DOS command prompt, connect to
  another NetWare server using the NetWare ATTACH command (ATTACH ServerB, for
  example). Do not establish a drive mapping to this second server.

3. From Schedule+, open an appointment book for a user on ServerB.

4. Close the calendar on ServerB.

5. Go to an MS-DOS command prompt and type the NetWare command WHOAMI.

You are only attached to ServerA, the server you originally logged in to.

Steps to Reproduce Problem for LAN Manager Environments
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Connect to a LAN Manager server and establish a connection with a drive
  letter designated for the Mail postoffice on ServerA (NET USE M:
  \\ServerA\&lt;share&gt;, for example).

2. Establish a UNC connection to another LAN Manager server without specifying a
  drive letter (NET USE \\ServerB\&lt;share&gt;, for example).

3. From Schedule+, open an appointment book for a user on ServerB.

4. Close the calendar on ServerB.

5. Go to an MS-DOS command prompt and type the LAN Manager command NET USE.

You are only attached to ServerA, the server you originally logged in to.
