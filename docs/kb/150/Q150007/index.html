-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Login.exe file from Microsoft File and Print Services for
NetWare (FPNW) version 3.51 and 4.0, and you fail in an attempt to log on to a
Novell server, the failed attempt will root map the Novell server's login area
to F:\. This becomes a problem if a Novell login script expects to be in and at
a certain drive and directory prompt, such as F:\LOGIN.

Normally, Novell NETX shell behavior is not to root map the login area, even in
the case of logon failure. With a Novell NETX shell running on a DOS 6.x
computer, Novell's Login.exe would normally, in the event of a logon failure,
leave the user at the login area prompt, usually F:\LOGIN. You would then be
able to change out of this directory to another directory, such as F:\PUBLIC.
However, this is not how FPNW'S Login.exe file operates.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of this problem is currently under investigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that all logon attempts using FPNW'S Login.exe program supply a valid
user name and password to avoid a possible failure in the execution of the
user's Novell logon script.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
