-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The call forwarding feature of Microsoft Phone does not work properly after you
enable it.

CAUSE
=====

Some telephone exchanges activate call forwarding immediately after the call
forward code and phone number are entered. Other exchanges activate call
forwarding after someone answers the called phone or after call forwarding to
the same number twice.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft Phone's call forwarding feature works the same way as a physical phone
works on these exchanges, except that the call is hung up automatically after
dialing. In essence, the number must be dialed twice for forwarding to be
enabled.

NOTE: You must have subscribed to call forwarding from your phone company in
order for Microsoft Phone's call forwarding features to work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is a default 5 second delay after the modem finishes dialing and hangs up.
This delay is needed for the telephone system to respond to the call forward
request before hanging up. If the timeout is too small, the call forwarding
feature will not work.

For additional information, please contact your modem manufacturer about
obtaining an updated *.inf file.
