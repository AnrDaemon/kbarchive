SUMMARY
=======

Local security is not for casual use. It should be used to protect data on
production servers from unauthorized access by people who have physical access
to these production servers.

Do not install local security on a production server without first installing it
on a test server to ensure that the usage and implications of local security are
clearly understood.

How much security is required in your situation is something you must decide;
however, it is expected that in the majority of cases local security is more
security than is needed.

Local security was added to OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.0 to meet the specialized,
more stringent security needs of what is expected to be a small minority of OS/2
LAN Manager customers. Therefore, we expect that for most OS/2 LAN Manager
customers, the additional planning and administration required to run local
security will not be necessary.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.1a 2.20 local security
