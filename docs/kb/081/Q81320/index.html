-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Windows version 3.0 is installed with a serial mouse on the
following machines

  KLH 386 Model 215
  KLH 286 Model 195
  Premier 286 Model 1400

the following problems may occur:

- If the Microsoft Or IBM PS/2 option is selected for the pointing device, the
  mouse pointer remains frozen in the middle of the screen.

- If the MouseSystems Or (VisiOn On ComX) option is selected for the pointing
  device, the mouse pointer will disappear as soon as it is moved.

CAUSE
=====

These problems occur because the above computers have a built-in bus mouse port
and the motherboard is set to access this port by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disabling the built-in bus port by setting DIP switch number 3 to OFF on the
motherboard of these machines corrects the above problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a bus mouse is being used, no problems should occur.

The three machines above are referred to as "Revision 1" machines and are no
longer in production.

For additional information on these machines, contact Entertainment Marketing
(Distributor).
