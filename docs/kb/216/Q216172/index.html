The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set up an NNTP pull feed from Netscape to Microsoft Exchange
Server, you get the following error messages: On Netscape:

  [99/01/11 17:04.52] innxmit:Unknown reply to "mode stream" -- 501 usage: mode
  reader

On Exchange Server:

  Event ID 11106
  MSExchangeNNTP
  Warning
  - An NNTP client connected from (IP Address) issued too many invalid commands.
  Dropping the connection.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server 5.5 does not support the Mode Stream command but does support
the Mode Reader command.

WORKAROUND
==========

At this time, Exchange Server does not support the Mode Stream command. You can
set up an NNTP push feed from Exchange Server to Netscape, which eliminates this
problem.
