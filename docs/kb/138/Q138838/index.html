The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the PowerPoint Viewer that comes with Office for Windows 95 or
PowerPoint for Windows 95 to show a PowerPoint for Windows 95 presentation, the
slides may look different than if you use PowerPoint to show the same slide
show.

Only the features that are supported by PowerPoint 4.0 are available when you use
the Viewer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following list describes the limitations of Viewer:

- Builds are limited to one level of bulleted text in the body text object. Any
  builds produced using the Animation settings are ignored. The objects that
  the Animation settings were applied to are visible on the screen all the
  time.

- Sound effects applied to an object's builds or transitions are ignored.

- Semi-transparent fills are changed to solid colors.

- Textured fills are changed to the default fill color of the current color
  scheme.

- Features such as Meeting Minder, Slide Navigator, Slide Meter, and Slide
  Conferencing are not available.

- Interactive settings (creating hot spots with associated actions that play
  when the hot spot is clicked) are ignored.

The PowerPoint Viewer that ships with the Windows 95 version of Office and
PowerPoint is essentially the same as the 16-bit version of Viewer that shipped
with PowerPoint 4.0c. It will run on Windows 95, Windows 3.1, and Windows NT.
When you show a presentation with Viewer, Viewer translates the presentation to
PowerPoint 4.0 format. Therefore, only the features that are also supported by
PowerPoint 4.0 are retained.

NOTE: These changes to the presentation are not saved; so, if you open the
presentation in PowerPoint for Windows 95, you'll see that the new features are
retained.
