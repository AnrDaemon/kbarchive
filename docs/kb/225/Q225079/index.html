-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x document in Microsoft Word, select text
that includes WordPerfect font special characters, and change the font, the
special characters may change to different characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do the following to obtain the best possible results when opening WordPerfect
documents in Microsoft Word:

- Install the WordPerfect fonts on your system. For more information about how
  to install the WordPerfect fonts, please contact WordPerfect.

  For information about how to contact Corel WordPerfect, click the appropriate
  article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

- If your document was created in Corel WordPerfect 5.1 or 6.0 for Windows,
  open the document in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

  If your document was created in Corel WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 for DOS, open
  the document in Corel WordPerfect 5.1 or 6.0 for Windows, save it in the
  WordPerfect for Windows format, and then open it in Microsoft Word 97 for
  Windows.

Additional Notes
----------------

- If the WordPerfect typographical symbol font does not exist on the system,
  the converter cannot make the symbol into something meaningful. The symbol
  will become a dash.

- You can insert special characters in WordPerfect by pressing ALT+W and then
  picking a character number such as 4,4. Many of these WordPerfect special
  characters are only contained in the fonts shipped by WordPerfect. If your
  system does not contain these fonts, there is no way to create these
  characters.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
