SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Service does not start and causes inbound mail to stop
flowing. You may find that there is plenty of disk space. Restarting the
Internet Mail Service temporarily resolves the issue until the mail stops
flowing again. The application event log may report the following error messages
from the MSExchangeIMC service:

  4070: An error occurred while opening a temporary message file. Verify that
  the message spool directories are configured correctly and are readable by
  the Internet Mail Service.

  4131: An unexpected error occurred in the Internet Mail Service. Information
  about this error is stored in the data portion of this event.

CAUSE
=====

An application or a user may have deleted the Exchsrvr\Imcdata\In directory.
When permissions on the C:\Exchsrvr\Imcdata\In directory are not set to Read
Only, the directory may be deleted or renamed by any outside agent during
Internet Mail Service operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Verify that the C:\Exchsrvr\Imcdata\In directory exists before restarting the
  Internet Mail Service.

2. Recreate the directory if necessary.

3. Set the Everyone group's access level to the Imcdata directory to Read Only,
  and restart the Internet Mail Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you notice that the directory is being deleted, you may want to enable
auditing to determine the source of the activity. For additional information,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
