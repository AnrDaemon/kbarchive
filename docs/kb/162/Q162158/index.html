-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type "NET ACCOUNTS /SYNC" (without the quotation marks) at the command
prompt, you may receive either of the following error messages:

  System error 1717 has occurred.
  The interface is unknown.

-or-

  System error 50 has occurred.
  The network request is not supported.

All the other NET ACCOUNTS switches may generate the following error:

  The request will be processed at the primary domain controller for domain
  &lt;domain_name&gt;. Could not find domain controller for this domain. More
  help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2453.

When you type "NET NELPMSG 2453" (without the quotation marks) you may receive
the following error message:

  Could not find domain controller for this domain.

CAUSE
=====

You receive the first error message above (system error 1717) when the Netlogon
service is not running correctly on the computer from which the command was run.
The NET ACCOUNTS /SYNC command is supported on a primary or backup domain
controller. Although it is not supported on a member server or a workstation,
the same error can occur if the Netlogon service has been stopped.

NOTE: All NET ACCOUNTS switches, other than /SYNC, can be successfully run on the
primary domain controller (PDC), even when the Netlogon service is not running.

The second error message above (system error 50) can occur when the NET ACCOUNTS
/SYNC command is run on a member server or workstation. The /SYNC switch is only
supported on a domain controller.

The third error message above may result when the NET ACCOUNTS command is run on
a backup domain controller (BDC), a member server, or a workstation if the
Netlogon service is not running correctly on the PDC. Unlike the /SYNC switch,
the other switches do not require the Netlogon service to be running on the
computer from which the command was run.

The fourth error message above occurs if Windows NT cannot find the domain
controller for the domain. The task cannot be completed unless the domain
controller runs in the domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve these problems, start the Netlogon service on the domain controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the NET ACCOUNTS command to synchronize the user account database
within a domain, and to set some policies. For all of the switches of the
command to work properly, the Netlogon service must be running correctly on the
primary and backup domain controllers.

The following is the syntax of the NET ACCOUNTS command:

  NET ACCOUNTS [/FORCELOGOFF:{minutes | NO}] [/MINPWLEN:length]
               [/MAXPWAGE:{days | UNLIMITED}] [/MINPWAGE:days]
               [/UNIQUEPW:number] [/DOMAIN]
  NET ACCOUNTS [/SYNC]
