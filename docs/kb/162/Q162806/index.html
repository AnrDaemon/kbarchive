MORE INFORMATION
================

There are five different game-play commentaries available in Golf 3.0; Classic,
Default, Attitude, Tournament, and Comedy. The following is a description of
each commentary type:

- Classic: This commentary features the sounds from Microsoft Golf versions 1.0
  and 2.0.

- Default: This standard commentary closely resembles the Classic sounds but is
  a little more traditional.

- Attitude: This dialog consists of amusing catch phrases, wisecracks, and
  snappy retorts.

- Tournament: This narration has a whispering announcer who critiques every
  shot, while the gallery reacts in the background.

- Comedy: For this commentary, put your ego aside as a comedic announcer tees
  off on your game.
