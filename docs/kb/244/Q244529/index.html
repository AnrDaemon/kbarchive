SUMMARY
=======

The Find Recipients tool in the Exchange Server Administrator program does not
use standard wildcard characters to perform wildcard searches on recipient
attributes.

For example, if you look for recipients that have the last name of Smith by using
"smi??" or "smi*" as criteria in your search, your search does not return the
expected results. Instead, use "smi" without wildcard characters as the
criteria. The Find Recipients tool uses ambiguous name resolution to find
recipients with last names that begin with "smi."

Because of this, you cannot search for recipients by checking for the existence
of an attribute when you use the Find Recipients tool. For example, you cannot
use an asterisk in the Last box to search for recipients who have data in the
Last Name box.

MORE INFORMATION
