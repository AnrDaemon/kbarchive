  Exception c0000005 has occured with parameters 404762 and 0 (Internal ID
  1101093). Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for
  assistance.

  1025
  MSExchangeIS Private
  Warning
  An error occurred. Function name or description of problem:
  EcGenerateReadReport: Error: 1244

CAUSE
=====

These problems occur when the maximum size paged of non-paged pool that can be
allocated by one process has been limited on the Microsoft Exchange Server
computer.

The non-paged pool is an area of system memory reserved for objects that must
remain in physical memory as long as they are active. The paged pool is an area
of system memory reserved for objects that can be paged to disk when they are
not being used.

The maximum amount of space that can be allocated by one process in the paged and
non-paged pools is controlled with the following registry keys:

  PagedPoolQuota
  NonPagedPoolQuota

These registry keys are located in the following registry path:

  HKEY_LocalMachine\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
  Manager\Memory Management

The default value of these registry keys is 0. If a nonzero value between 1 and
128 has been specified, no single process can allocate more space in the pool
than the specified amount.

When value of these registry keys is set to 0, there are no pool quotas.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure these registry keys are set to the default value of 0.
