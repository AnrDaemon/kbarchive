-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an ODBC application makes a certain sequence of calls to connect to an ODBC
driver, a memory loss on the order of a few hundred bytes may occur due to a
memory leak in the Driver Manager. The sequence that results in the memory leak
is as follows:

     SQLAllocEnv&lt;BR/&gt;
     SQLAllocConnect&lt;BR/&gt;
     SQLConnect or SQLDriverConnect&lt;BR/&gt;
     SQLDisconnect&lt;BR/&gt;
     SQLFreeConnect&lt;BR/&gt;
     SQLFreeEnv

This leak affects only those applications that connect and disconnect frequently
without ever exiting the application. For SQL Server replication users, this
problem is encountered when a distribution server connects to subscription
servers as an ODBC client.

WORKAROUND
==========

An application can share connections. If an application needs to connect and
disconnect frequently, you can shut down the application periodically. For
example, if an application is running as a Windows NT service, you can
periodically shut down and restart the service in order to clean up the memory
leak.


Under Windows NT and Windows 95, each application has its own memory address
space. After the application is shut down, Windows NT and Windows 95 will clean
up the application's memory space, including the memory leak.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Open Database
Connectivity version 2.5.x. This problem has been corrected in Microsoft Open
Database Connectivity version 3.0.x.
