SUMMARY
=======

When you delete an address from your Personal Address Book (PAB) and that
address was a member of a personal distribution list (PDL), the deleted address
remains in the PDL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by product design; it is intended to give the ability to have a personal
entry in a PDL without having the entry in the PAB.

You may want someone with the friendly (display) name of Jack Frost to be
included in your PDL, but not to be listed in your PAB. This would be useful
when performing Ambiguous Name Resolution (ANR) against the Global Address List
(GAL) if there was another Jack Frost in the GAL. This way, the Jack Frost in
your PAB is not accidentally matched when you Check Names.
