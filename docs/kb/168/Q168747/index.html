-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Microsoft Windows 95 (all releases) using the Microsoft
TCP/IP protocol, the following error message may occur when certain data is
received over the network:

  Fatal exception 0E at 0028:&lt;address&gt; in VxD MSTCP(01) + 000041AE.
  This was called from 0028:&lt;address&gt; in VxD NDIS(01) + 00000D7C.

After this error message occurs, the computer may not receive further network
data until Windows is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if certain, very specific, "out-of-band" data
packets are deliberately sent to the server during a TCP/IP session.


RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated files for Windows 95 (all
releases):

- Vtcp.386 version 4.00.0954 (dated 05/20/97) and later

- Vnbt.386 version 4.00.0959 (dated 05/15/97) and later

To install these updated files, follow these steps:

1. Download the Vtcpupd.exe file to an empty folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Vtcpupd.exe file you
