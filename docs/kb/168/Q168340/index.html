The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After moving a Systems Management Server NetWare Logon Server from site A to
site B, you may see some extraneous .tmp files in the Sms\Logon.srv directory of
that logon server.

CAUSE
=====

When clients log on to a NetWare server that has been moved from one site to
another and run the Systems Management Server script, the inventory will not be
taken for three times (or however many times InvAgtFalseLogonCount is set for).
On the third logon, the clients write a .tmp file in the
Sms\Logon.srv\Inventry.box directory on that NetWare logon server. The .tmp file
is a small file, and does not contain all the inventory information. The .tmp
file will not be converted to a .raw file, and therefore is not moved by
Maintenance Manager to the site server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually delete the .tmp files. Be sure to only
delete those files that are affected by this problem, and do not delete any new
.tmp files that are waiting to be converted to .raw files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
