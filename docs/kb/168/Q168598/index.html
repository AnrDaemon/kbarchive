-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running the Systems Management Server logon script and the operating
system finishes loading, a NetWare client will get the message "Verifying
Microsoft Systems Management Server client installation...". This indicates that
the client software has not been completely installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Nwnetapi.dll file is missing. This file is a NetWare file, and is not
distributed with Systems Management Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the file from your NetWare installation or
directly from Novell. The file is available for download from Novell's Internet
Web site,

  http://www.novell.com/.

Place a copy of the file on your Systems Management Server site server in the
Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin directory. The Maintenance Manager
service will copy the file to each of the NetWare logon servers. When this is
done, the clients will download it the next time the Systems Management Server
script is run and will then complete the client installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Systems Management Server logon script is run on the client, it shows
the message "Verifying Microsoft Systems Management Server client installation"
and then continues with the inventory collection. The operating system finishes
loading. If the message "Verifying Microsoft Systems Management Server client
installation" appears again, the Systems Management Server client software is
not completely installed.

If you examine the [WorkstationStatus] section of the Sms.ini file, you will see
the following line:

     FilesNotDownloaded=NWNETAPI.DLL

Also, the [Local] section of the Sms.ini will have the following line:

     SetupPhase=verify_files


Additional query words: prodsms win95 win16 wfw
