The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using Microsoft Plus! For Kids Protect It!, you will normally see a user
named ".Default" in the Protect It! list of family members. ".Default" is the
exact name that will show up in the listing of family members inside Protect
It!

NOTE: Do not confuse the ".Default" user with a user named "Default".

The ".Default" user is automatically created by Windows 95/98. Your computer uses
this user for the following two things:

1. The restrictions assigned to the ".Default" user are applied when a family
  member bypasses the standard logon by clicking the ESC key or by clicking
  Cancel.

  If you want to make your computer more restrictive, assign the
  full/appropriate restrictions to the ".Default" user. A ".Default" user with
  no restrictions allows any user (or newly created user) who bypasses logon
  full access to your computer.

2. The ".Default" user is a template for creating new users.

  When you add a new user to Protect It!, all of the Start menu entries and
  Document entries from the ".Default" user are initially assigned to your new
  family member. You can then customize each new family member based on the
  standard ".Default" user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to designate the word "Default" as a family member. This is the
exact name (without the initial period) within the family members listing in
Protect It!.

Do not confuse the "Default" user with the ".Default" user described in the
section above. If you see a "Default" user, designate restrictions as you would
with any other valid family member.

Additional query words: restrict profile
