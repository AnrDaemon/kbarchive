SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to set up Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
replication between two or more WINS servers in separate, untrusting domains.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to set up WINS replication between one or more WINS servers in
untrusting domains without having a valid user account in the untrusting
domain.

To configure replication, the administrator for each WINS server must use WINS
manager and set their respective server(s) to allow replication with the WINS
server in the remote domain(s). (Note: The following steps must be performed at
each WINS server.)

To configure replication, perform the following steps:

1. Start WINS manager and select the IP address of the WINS server that you
  administer.

2. On the Server menu, click Replication Partners, and then click Add.

3. Type the IP address of the remote WINS server (with which replication will
  occur).

4. Click OK, and a Validate WINS Server message will appear. Type the computer
  name of the opposite WINS server, and then click OK.

5. Select the IP address of the computer just added (with which replication is
  desired).

6. Set the Replication options at the bottom of the screen (Set as Push, Pull
  partner, or both), and then click OK.

7. After each administrator has configured their respective WINS server and
  clicked OK, it is possible to use the Replicate Now option to start
  replication.

NOTE: Replication will occur and the remote WINS server's database will be
viewable under the Show Database option. However, without an account with proper
permissions in all domains or servers involved, it is not possible to use WINS
manager to make changes to the remote WINS database.

Replication can also occur between two separate stand-alone servers that
participate in a workgroup by using the procedures listed above.

Additional query words: Replicate Domain trust relationship push pull partner untrusted replication
