- Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to install The Puzzle Collection to a floppy disk instead of the
computer's hard disk, the Setup program will stop or appear to hang. The only
way to close the program is by using the Close Program window.

NOTE: Depending on which operating environment you are using, the computer will
need to be rebooted after you close the program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following information to return you computer to a normal state, and then
reinstall The Puzzle Collection.

The Puzzle Collection under Windows 95
--------------------------------------

If you are running Windows 95 and you attempt to install The Puzzle Collection on
a floppy drive, when you click OK the computer appears to hang.

To end Setup, do the following:

1. Use the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination to open the Close Program window.

2. Select The Puzzle Collection Setup, and then click the End Task button.

3. Once you have completed steps 1 and 2, the computer will stop responding
  (hang) and you will be required to reboot the computer.

Once the computer has been rebooted and Windows 95 is running again, you will
need to re-run Setup for The Puzzle Collection.

NOTE: Do not select a floppy disk drive letter as the installation point.

The Puzzle Collection under Windows NT 4.0
------------------------------------------

If you are running Windows NT 4.0 and you attempt to install the product on a
floppy drive, when you click OK you will receive the following error message:

  The destination folder: A: does not exist. Do you want setup to create it?

Nothing happens when you click Ignore or Abort.

To end Setup, do the following:

1. Use the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination to open the Windows NT Security window.

2. On the Task Manager tab, select The Puzzle Collection Setup and close the
  program.

After you have ended the Setup program, you will need to re-run Setup for The
Puzzle Collection.
