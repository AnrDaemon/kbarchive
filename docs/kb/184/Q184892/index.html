SYMPTOMS
========

When you change settings in the DirectX tool in Control Panel, you may
experience unexpected behavior. Note that the Directx.cpl file is the DirectX
tool in Control Panel

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you change any of the original settings in the
DirectX tool.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, restore the original settings in the DirectX tool, and
then restart your computer.

NOTE: It is impossible to determine what the original settings were unless you
noted them. If you do not know the original settings, Microsoft suggests that
you restore your system from a known good backup. If you do not have a backup
copy of your system, you may need to install Windows into a new folder, and then
install your programs again to re-create affected registry entries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DirectX tool is available only when you install the Microsoft DirectX
Software Development Kit (SDK). It is designed only for developers to test
DirectX programs under a variety of conditions. For example, it is used to turn
off DirectX features to test games under "problem" conditions.


The DirectX tool is not designed to solve problems with DirectX. It is designed
to review and alter DirectX configuration settings as DirectX- based programs
are being developed. The original settings in the DirectX tool are based on
installed hardware and drivers, and vary from computer to computer.

For more information about how to troubleshoot DirectX issues, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
