-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the following conditions exist:

- The Internet Mail Service is configured to forward all messages to a
  particular Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) host

- The routing is configured with either the "Do not Reroute incoming STMP Mail"
  or "Re-route incoming SMTP Mail" option set and the SMTP domain accepted as
  incoming

- A custom recipient exists in the global address list for a user in that
  domain

when Internet mail arrives for that user with a null From address, the From
address is changed from "Mail From:&lt;&gt;" to the following:

  Mail From:&lt;unknown&gt;

For example, if the following conditions exist

- The SMTP host is smtp.microsoft.com with a user called user@microsoft.com

- A Custom Recipient (Internet mail) is created on the Exchange Server computer
  for user@microsoft.com

- In the Internet ConnIMC properties, on the Connection tab, "Forward all
  messages to host" is selected with the value "smtp.microsoft.com," and on the
  Routing tab "Do not Reroute incoming SMTP Mail" is selected

when Internet mail arrives with a null From address as "Mail From:&lt;&gt;" to
user@microsoft.com at the Internet Mail Service connector, the Internet Mail
Service accepts the mail and attempts to forward the mail to smtp.microsoft.com,
but the From address is changed from "Mail From:&lt;&gt;" to the following:

  Mail From:&lt;unknown&gt;
