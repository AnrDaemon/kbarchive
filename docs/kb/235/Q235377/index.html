The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the command line for a program contains a space, the advertisement does not
work. You receive the following error message after clients attempts to run the
advertisement:

  10003
  An error occurred while preparing to run the program for advertisement
  &lt;Advertisement_ID &gt;&lt;Advertisement_Name&gt;.The operating system
  reported error 2: The system cannot find the file specified

  Additional program properties:
  Command line: &lt;Command Line&gt;
  Working directory: &lt;Working Directory&gt;
  Drive letter (? = any):
  Possible cause: This message most commonly occurs when the program's
  command-line executable file could not be found, when a required drive letter
  connection to a distribution point could not be established, or when the
  program is configured to use the Windows NT Client Software Installation
  Account but the account is not specified, could not be found, or does not
  have the appropriate permissions. Solution: Check each of the items listed
  above.

CAUSE
=====

When APM attempts to run the command line, it looks for only the string value
that precedes the space. For example, if you rename Notepad.exe to "Run
Notepad.exe", APM looks only for the "Run" string to start.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rename the program file to one contiguous name without any spaces.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
