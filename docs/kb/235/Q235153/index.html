SYMPTOMS
========

When a Software Metering Client Agent is unable to contact a software metering
server, the Software Metering Client Agent goes into the Retry mode. However,
the attempted retry may not occur.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur because the default configuration settings prevent the
retry from occurring. By default, the settings in the Configuration Polling
Interval box and the Delay Before Retrying box are both set to 240 minutes.
These settings disable the attempted connection retry as the polling interval is
activated before the retry can occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, the setting in the Delay Before Retrying box must
be set to a value which is less than the setting in the Configuration Polling
Interval box.

NOTE: It is recommended that you configure the preceding settings before you
install any clients.

If these settings had not been configured before you enabled the Software
Metering Client Agent, the new configuration settings cannot be updated until
the next successful connection of the Software Metering Client Agent to the
software metering server.

An example of a configuration:

Retries = 5
Delay Before Retrying = 60
Configuration Polling Interval = 240

With the preceding configuration, the Software Metering Client Agent can make
five attempts to connect to the software metering server every 60 minutes. The
setting in the Configuration Polling Interval box ensures that a polling
interval occurs every 240 minutes.
