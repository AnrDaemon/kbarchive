SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to mount a Unix NFS volume on a computer running Windows NT 4.0
Server or Workstation and you are running the Microsoft Windows NT Services for
Unix NFS Client, you may not be able to connect and you may receive the
following error message:

  The network path was not found.

NOTE: You may receive this error message if you attempt to map a drive to a Unix
NFS host using the Map Network Drive graphical interface or the NET USE command
from a command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when the default NFS access permissions are not in effect,
and the Windows NT client host has not been given explicit permission to mount
the NFS share on the computer running Unix.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, give the Windows NT host explicit permission to gain
access to the share or allow all clients to gain access.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In most versions of Unix, the /etc/exports file (/etc/dfs/dfstab in Solaris
Unix) controls the accessibility of local file systems to network clients. By
default, Unix NFS shares are exported with Read/Write permissions for all hosts.
However, if an NFS file system is shared with explicit permissions given to one
or more hosts, the default permissions are superceded, and only specified hosts
can gain access.

For example, if you export the file system /reports in /etc/exports as

  /reports

then /reports is shared with the default permissions of Read/Write for all
hosts.

However, if you export /reports as

  /reports host1 host2

then /reports can only be mounted by host1 or host2. No other remote hosts can
gain access to the share.
