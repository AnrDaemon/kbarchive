The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Cluster service attemtpts to bring one or more resources with an IP
address online, the following event may appear in the System Event log:

  Cluster IP address "IP address" could not create the required TCP/IP
  Interface.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Cluster service tried to bring an IP address
online. The resource properties may specify an invalid network or malfunctioning
adapter. This event may be registered if you replace a network adapter with a
different model and continue to use the old or inappropriate driver. As a
result, the IP address resource cannot be bound to the specified network.

This event message may also be displayed if you are using an OEM-provided driver
with the same name as the normal retail version of the adapter and choose to
update the driver with the non-OEM version when applying a service pack.

Mismatched versions of SSDs or other drivers requiring some form of
synchronization between nic cards can also cause this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, resolve the network adapter driver issue or change the
properties of the IP address resource to reflect the proper network for the
resource. This problem may also be caused by a malfunctioning adapter or a
conflict between similar network adapters and accompanying drivers. You may want
to eliminate adapters from the configuration in an attempt to determine which
adapter may be causing the problem.
