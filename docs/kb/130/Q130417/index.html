SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the SMS Remote Control functions and Remote
Access Service (RAS) to control a Windows for Workgroups client.

NOTE: The Windows for Workgroups client must not have the network card software
loaded. If it does, Systems Management Server records the NIC in the database
and tries to make the connections that way. Systems Management Server must see
the remote client as a RAS connection.

To setup Remote Control for a successful connection:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. From the Windows for Workgroups client:

  a. Reconfigure the Windows for Workgroups client network setup so that RAS is
     the only network adapter, and NetBEUI is the default protocol.

  b. Delete the existing SMS.INI file and the existing MS\SMS directory tree.

  c. Remove the SMSRUN16.EXE from the LOAD= line in the [windows] section of
     the WIN.INI file.

  d. Reboot the Windows for Workgroups client. Do not log on to the Systems
     Management Server server yet.

2. From the Systems Management Server server:

  a. Delete the existing client from the Systems Management Server database.

  b. Run Registry Editor and add some new LANAs and increase their timeouts:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE
          \Microsoft\SMS\Components\SightNT\Lana
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE
          \Microsoft\SMS\Components\SightNT\TimeOut

  c. Delete the Machine name if it is present.

  d. Make sure that an NdisWAN driver is the first protocol for the RAS server.
     To do this, run Control Panel, choose Network, select NetBIOS Interface,
     and then choose Configure.

  e. If any changes were made, re-boot the server.
