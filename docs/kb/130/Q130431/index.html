The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a time of 11:30 P.M. in the schedule window, the appointment
will end at 12:00 A.M. (midnight) the next day and not 11:59 P.M. the same day.
This affects appointments that are archived before the next day's date.

For example, a 30-minute appointment exists for 9/1/95 from 11:30 P.M. to 12:00
A.M. (9/2/95). If you choose to archive appointments before 9/2/95, the 11:30
P.M. appointment will not be archived because it does not end until 9/2/95.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design. All appointments start and stop on exact boundary
values. When you click the mouse pointer on a specific time slot, Schedule+
displays the date and length of time of the area you have selected. An 11:30
P.M. appointment will end at 12:00 A.M, in order to be consistent with
appointments created at other times during the day.

Additional query words: 7.00 schedule plus
