SYMPTOMS
========

Selecting the Form, New Property option while a control is highlighted does not
add a property to a control. The new property is added to a form.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. When a form is created with the CREATE FORM or MODIFY FORM
commands, a form object is instantiated, and instances of objects are
manipulated in design mode. Generally, a property cannot be added to an object
once it is instantiated, and to modify a visual class, it is necessary to use
the Class Designer. However, a special case has been made to the Form designer,
where the form is subclassed to allow the creation of form properties and
methods at form design time. This feature is not available for controls.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Class Designer to modify the class definition of a control. For more
information about using custom objects in a Form, refer to the 'Adding User
Defined Objects' paragraph in the Visual FoxPro "Developer's Guide," Chapter 9,
"Creating Forms."

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
