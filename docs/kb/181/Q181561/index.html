-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Logging on to a local Windows NT domain takes very long, about an hour. In a
network monitor trace, you will see many calls like lsarpc: LsarLookupNames with
names like administrators, administrateurs, and beheerders in the hex part of
these calls.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The symptom above can be observed with the following configuration:

- Systems Management Server Remote Control software installed on the clients

- Novell intraNetWare software (which includes a third-party GINA) installed on
  the clients

- The logon domain has +/- 15 bi-directional trusts

The default configuration of Systems Management Server Remote Control client sets
up workstations in a way that allows many international administrator groups
access to the Systems Management Server Remote Control clients. Examples of
international administrator groups are administrators (English), beheerders
(Dutch), and administrateurs (French). The complete list contains about 10
different groups and LsarLookupNames is called for each group separately to
determine the corresponding security descriptor. If the group name is not found
locally, all trusts are queried to find a specific group.

If Microsoft Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) is used for NetWare Connectivity,
the problem does not occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

One of the following workarounds can be used if Systems Management Server Remote
Control Software and Novell Connectivity are needed:

- Use Microsoft CSNW.

- Change Systems Management Server Remote Control client configuration to allow
  only specific international administrator groups access to the Systems
  Management Server Remote Control clients.

- Do not use a high number of trusts in the logon domain of the Systems
  Management Server Remote Control clients.
