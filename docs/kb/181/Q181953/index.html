-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message with a MIME attachment from an Exchange client and have
configured an Internet recipient to "Always send to this recipient as RTF", and
that recipient uses a POP3 client, the recipient will not receive the
attachment.

CAUSE
=====

The MIME-encoded attachment is still present but is not accessible by the POP3
client (depending on the receiving client). This problem only happens when
sending an attachment as MIME.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two ways to work around this problem:

1. Disable the option "Always send to this recipient as RTF" when sending an
  attachment to an Internet recipient using a POP3 client.

2. Do not include an attachment in an RTF message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most POP3 clients do not understand Rich Text Format (RTF) used by Microsoft
transport-neutral encapsulation format (TNEF). Consequently, the sender must
turn off the option "Always send to this recipient as RTF", in order for the
POP3 client to see the attachments.
