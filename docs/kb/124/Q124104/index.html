SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete a program item icon from a Program Manager group, if you hold
down the left (primary) mouse button while you press the DEL key, the following
message is displayed:

  Are you sure you want to delete the group &lt;groupname&gt;?

If you choose Yes, the icon is deleted. However, the moment you move the mouse
pointer into the group window, the next program item icon attaches to the
pointer as if a drag function is being performed, even if the mouse button is
not being held down. Program Manager continues in this drag mode until you click
or release the mouse button. At that point, it drops the icon at the current
location, as long as it is valid; otherwise, it is dropped into its original
group.

If you choose No, the screen returns to normal; however, the moment you move the
pointer into the group window, the item icon that had been selected attaches to
the pointer as if a drag function is being performed, even if the mouse button
is not held down. Program Manager continues in this drag mode until you click or
release the mouse button. At that point, it drops the icon at the current
location, as long as it is valid; otherwise, it is dropped into its original
group.

If the group is empty, the deletion works correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups versions
3.10 and 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. At this time, no
workaround is available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 3.x delete
