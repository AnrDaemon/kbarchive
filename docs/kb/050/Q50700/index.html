Question:

I am writing a DLL with a start-up routine written in C.

The start-up routine is getting a protection violation within a
sprintf call (the first call to a C run-time function).

Can the start-up routine call the C Run Time Library?  Why is this
bombing?

This works correctly if I link the .DLL with LLIBCDLL.LIB and use the
appropriate .OBJ files.

Response:

In general, you cannot call the run time library from a multithreaded
.DLL initialization routine (one that uses CRTLIB.DLL).

The reason is that C_INIT() doesn't completely initialize CRTLIB.DLL;
this is not initialized until the .EXE start-up code is executed.

You still must call C_INIT() from within your .DLL initialization
routine in order to perform other necessary initializations.

There are two possible workarounds:

1.  Write your own functions to replace sprintf().

2.  Don't use user initialization; instead, call an initialization
    routine in your .DLL from the beginning of your .EXE. Since
    your code in your .EXE does not execute until after the .EXE's
    start-up is executed, CRTLIB.DLL will be initialized by the time
    you attempt to initialize your .DLL.
