-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual Basic, when you run the SourceSafe CheckOut Command, the following
error message displays in Visual Basic:

  All available files have already been checked out.

CAUSE
=====

The project was open in Visual Basic when it was moved or renamed in the Visual
SourceSafe Explorer. Because the project was moved or renamed, the SourceSafe
Add-In in Visual Basic can no longer can find it.


RESOLUTION
==========

In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, when you run SourceSafe commands that impact
a project open in Visual Basic, click Refresh File Status on the Add- Ins /
SourceSafe menu. By refreshing the project file status, Visual Basic is able to
get in sync with Visual SourceSafe.

If you run Refresh File Status after the series of steps listed in the "Steps to
Reproduce Behavior" section of this article, this message appears:

  Project &lt;old VSS project location&gt; has been moved or renamed to
  &lt;found VSS project location&gt;. Would you like to connect to this
  project?

This project location may or may not be the project you want. In most cases, it
probably is, so you can click OK and you continue on with your work.

If you click Cancel, the following error message displays:

  Project &lt;old VSS project location&gt; was not found. Would you like to
  browse for the project?

If you know the new location or new name for the file, click Yes, and select the
new project location or name. If you click No, the following error message
displays:

  The project "&lt;old VSS project location&gt;", &lt;VSS Database File&gt; no
  longer exists in SourceSafe. You must either recover or re-create the project
  before you can use this project with source code control.

At this point, there is no longer any link between any Visual SourceSafe project
and the project you currently have open in Visual Basic.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual Basic, open a sample project, and add it to Source Code control.

2. In Visual Basic, run the SourceSafe Explorer. (On the Add-Ins menu, click
  SourceSafe and then Run SourceSafe.

3. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, move the project to another location, such
  as into a subdirectory.

4. In Visual Basic, check out the files. The following error message displays:

  All available files have already been checked out.

Of course, you know the files are not checked out, neither in Visual Basic nor
the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.
