SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Notes Configuration utility with the Lotus Notes 5.0.2b client,
you may receive the following error message which prevents you from creating the
connection document:

  You have insufficient access to perform this action

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Notes connector ID tries to create a domain entry
in the Public Address Book on the Lotus Notes-based server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, assign the ID file that is being used to create the
configuration document the roles of both "NetModifier" and "NetCreator" in the
Notes Public Address Book.

STATUS
======

This a problem with the Lotus Notes 5.0.2b client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a Notes connector on an Exchange Server-based computer, having
manager access to the Notes Public Address Book is not sufficient enough access
to complete the procedure. You must give the connector ID specific roles on the
Notes Public Address Book database.
