SUMMARY
=======

On Friday March 26, 1999, several corporate networks across the world were
stricken with a Microsoft Word macro virus referred to as "Melissa." Because of
its unusual ability to propagate itself through electronic mail, the virus
forced companies to disable portions of their e-mail systems to prevent further
propagation both within and outside of their firms. Besides self-propagation,
the virus sent inappropriate e-mail to addresses that it found in personal
address books on Microsoft Outlook mail clients. A similar subsequent virus
recently targeted data destruction.

MORE INFORMATION
