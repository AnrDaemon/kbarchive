SUMMARY
=======

Many applications use Int 21 to create unique temporary files. However, a
problem has been discovered with HPFS.386 that can result in an infinite loop
within this process.

PROBLEM ID: PR9301001

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to create a new file in an HPFS386 directory that is read-only,
the error returned is "file exists." If Int 21 is trying to create a temporary
file and it receives that error, it will increment the temporary file name by
one and repeat the request.

There are two symptoms this creates. First, the client PC will hang or go into
"beeping death." Second, the server will slow down as it is processing repeated
attempts to create the file. Typically the disk light will stay on, and you will
notice performance degradation with other clients until the offending client PC
is rebooted. This behavior has been observed by users of Microsoft Word and
PowerPoint, but the potential for problems extends to any application that
creates temporary files on LAN Manager 2.1 servers.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by an incorrect return code from HPFS.386.

RESOLUTION
==========

HPFS.386 should return extended error 65 (access denied). It has been modified
to correct this problem. If you are hanging while attempting to save documents
to read-only directories, replace HPFS.386. Replace
&lt;lanroot&gt;\NETPROG\HPFS.386 with a patched version dated 7/23/92, available
from Microsoft PSS (CSD00.050).

Additional query words: 2.10 hang
