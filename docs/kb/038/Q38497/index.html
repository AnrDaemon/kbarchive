It has been reported that when using a LogiTech mouse and QB.EXE in
EGA 43-line mode, the mouse cursor disappears below the 25th line. The
mouse is active even though invisible, i.e., it can place the cursor
at any location on the screen, or make selections in dialog boxes.

When using the Microsoft Mouse and the mouse driver that is included
with QuickBASIC Version 4.50, the mouse operates properly in 25-line,
43-line, and 50-line modes.

Microsoft does not claim compatibility of QuickBASIC with the LogiTech
mouse, or any mouse other than the Microsoft Mouse. QuickBASIC
requires you to use the Microsoft Mouse with the mouse driver that
comes on the QuickBASIC disk (or a later version of the Microsoft
Mouse driver).

Although Microsoft does not claim compatibility, QuickBASIC should
work correctly with the latest Logitech mouse drivers (such as
Versions 3.42 and 3.43). Earlier versions such as LogiMouse driver
Version 3.2 will not work correctly with QuickBASIC. If QuickBASIC
does not work with your version of the LogiMouse driver, you should
contact Logitech to determine if an upgrade driver is available.
Logitech's phone numbers are as follows:

   LogiMouse (415) 795-8500
   LogiTech, Inc. (415) 795-0427 Technical Support Line
