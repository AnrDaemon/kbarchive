SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to make simple calls to an XML Web
service by using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Toolkit version 2.0.

Create an Application in Visual Basic
-------------------------------------

1. Download and install the SOAP Toolkit from the following Microsoft Developer
  Network (MSDN) Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=/code/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/580/msdncompositedoc.xml

  This includes downloads for the Toolkit, the Toolkit samples, and a merge
  module for redistributing the underlying objects that you can include with
  the setup program for your application.

2. Make a local copy of the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file.

NOTE: Although this step is not required, you should make a copy on your local
computer. It is possible to specify the URL for the WSDL on the remote server,
but it can be more convenient to copy the file locally.

3. In your Visual Basic project, add a reference to the Microsoft SOAP Type
  Library. To do this, select References on the Project menu, and then be sure
  that Microsoft Soap Type Library is selected in the list. Click OK.

4. Create an instance of the SoapClient object, as follows:

  Dim oSoapClient As New MSSOAPLib.SoapClient

5. Initialize the SoapClient object with the WSDL file that you copied in Step 2
  by using the mssoapinit method, as follows:

  oSoapClient.mssoapinit "C:\CLIENTWSDLS\CALC.WSDL", "Calc", "CalcSoapPort"

  The first parameter is the path to the WSDL file. The second parameter is the
  value of the name attribute for the service element in the WSDL file that
  corresponds to the XML Web service that you want to call. The third parameter
  is the port type for the service element that corresponds to the XML Web
  service that you want to call. This parameter indicates the type of
  connection that will be made to the XML Web service.

6. Call the XML Web service method by using the SoapClient object as if it were
  a method that is exposed by the SoapClient object itself. For example, if you
  attempt to call an XML Web service method called Add that takes two integers
  as parameters, your code may resemble the following:

  Dim Sum As Integer
  Sum = oSoapClient.Add(3, 4)

7. Build and run the program.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the methods require complex parameters, you may need to handle them
differently. For more information, see the "Handling Complex Types" topic in the
online documentation for SOAP Toolkit 2.0.
