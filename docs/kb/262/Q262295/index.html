-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Client Component Installation Manager (CCIM) shuts down and does not restart
when you run Smsman.exe on an installed client that is running Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) and Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack
1 (SP1).

CAUSE
=====

CCIM shows a shutdown request. This happens just after you start Smsman.exe. It
reports that CCIM is successfully registered; CliSvc reports that CCIM is
already running. The CCIM shutdown prevents the SetEvent or any other CCIM
requests from being run.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use the Services tool in Control Panel to stop and
restart SMS Client Service.

Or, wait for one hour. CCIM wakes up on its own as part of its next polling
cycle.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
