SUMMARY
=======

Problems have been reported when using a mouse connected to the built-in mouse
port on IBM PS/2 computers with Flight Simulator Version 3.00. The program will
load successfully, but after a few minutes the mouse will begin moving the yoke
erratically and executing commands from the menus.

A workaround is to configure the mouse as a serial mouse and connect it to an
available serial port. This method will work only if the mouse is not an IBM
mouse, which must be connected to the built-in PS/2 mouse port.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Flight Simulator Version 3.00.
This problem was corrected in Version 4.00.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The built-in PS/2 mouse port is a 6-pin plug located adjacent to the keyboard
port on the back panel of the PS/2.
