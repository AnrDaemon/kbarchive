SUMMARY
=======

A private information store only server, also known as a dedicated mailbox
server, is a server that the public information store has been removed from.
This article provides steps to bring back the public information store to a
private information store only server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To re-create the public information store:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click New on the File menu, and
  then click Other.

2. Click Information Store, and then click Public.

3. In the Server list, click the server on which you want to re-create the
  public information store. Only servers in the site that do not have a public
  information store are displayed in the list.

4. You may receive the following message:

  The public folder server property on the Private Information Store of
  &lt;server_name&gt; has not been adjusted to point to the newly created
  Public Information Store. You should not change this property until the
  public folder hierarchy has been replicated to the new Public Information
  Store. To verify that replication is complete, establish a new connection to
  &lt;server_name&gt;, and view the Folders hierarchy.

5. Click OK.

6. Run Performance Optimizer and click to select the Public Store check box.

7. Quit the Administrator program, and then restart the Administrator program
  and connect to the server on which you created the new public information
  store.

8. In the Administrator program, make sure that the public information store
  object has been re-created.
