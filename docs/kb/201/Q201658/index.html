SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation of a secondary site that is initiated from a parent
site, the installation status may stop at "Pending." When this occurs, the
site's status may show that the installation did not succeed. The Bootstrap
service on the secondary site may be started, or may not have started
successfully.

CAUSE
=====

If a problem occurs when the Bootstrap service is starting or in the running of
the Bootstrap service tasks during the secondary site creation process, no
status message is sent to the parent site. An entry may or may not be written to
the Bootstrap log file (Sms_bootstrap.log) to indicate a problem. When this
occurs, the primary parent site shows the secondary site in a pending state.

This behavior occurs because after the Bootstrap service has been installed and
an attempt has been made to start it, the Sender thread at the parent site is
disconnected and no communication path exists between the parent and child site
until the child site installation is complete.

If the Bootstrap service cannot install the site during the secondary site
creation, it records that information in the Bootstrap log on the secondary site
server. The Bootstrap service then quits. No status message is sent to the
parent site server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information about the secondary site installation process, see

document is part of Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit version 4.5.
