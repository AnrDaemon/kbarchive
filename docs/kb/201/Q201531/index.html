The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you send a free and busy request to a nonexistent Novell GroupWise domain or
nonexistant post office through the Novell API Gateway, the Novell NetWare
server may stop responding (crash). This is caused by a bug in GroupWise and its
API Gateway in handling non-delivery reports (NDRs).

The Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector transfers free and busy information
between Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 and Novell GroupWise mail systems.
For more information on this connector, please refer to the Calcon.rtf file,
which is located in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Calcon\Doc folder, after you install
the connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GroupWise message transfer agent (MTA) is not handling free and busy NDRs
properly. After the GroupWise MTA receives the request by means of the API
gateway, the GroupWise MTA responds with a mail-based NDR. The API Gateway picks
up the mail NDR and attempts to match it with the original free and busy
request. The following error message is displayed:

  Message does not contain Orig-Msg-ID property.

The API Gateway goes into an unstable state. The next free and busy request
causes the server to crash.

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
