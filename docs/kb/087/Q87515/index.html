-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2 
- Microsoft NMAKE Utility for OS/2, versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an NMAKE version 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2, or 1.21 INCLUDE macro, which can be
used to modify the include environment variable, is created from other macros,
the text substitution will not be done when there is an implied use of the
include environment variable with the !INCLUDE directive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not use macros to redefine the include
environment variable. For example, change the assignment from

     INCLUDE=$(INCLUDE1);$(INCLUDE2)

to

     INCLUDE=C:\DIR1;C:\DIR2

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in NMAKE versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13,
and 1.2 for MS-DOS and versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, and 1.21 for OS/2. This
problem was corrected in NMAKE version 1.3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following example, the INCLUDE macro is created from the INCLUDE1 and
INCLUDE2 macros. When the !INCLUDE is executed, NMAKE will search the
directories pointed to by the include environment variable for the file
TEST.INC.

However, at this point the INCLUDE macro is still equal to
$(INCLUDE1);$(INCLUDE2) and has not been expanded out to C:\DIR1;C:\DIR2, so the
include environment variable has not been modified yet. If the file TEST.INC is
not in the current directory, NMAKE will generate the error:

  fatal error U1052: file 'test.inc' not found

If the INCLUDE macro is explicitly used in a command line, it will be expanded
correctly.

Sample Makefile
---------------

  /* Command line options needed: None
  */ 

  INCLUDE1=C:\DIR1
  INCLUDE2=C:\DIR2

  INCLUDE=$(INCLUDE1);$(INCLUDE2)

  !INCLUDE &lt;TEST.INC&gt;

  ALL:
   @ECHO Made it!
