The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the online Help and on page 618 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler
Programmer's Guide" for MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b, the ALIAS keyword is
listed as a word that is reserved for future use. While the feature was actually
implemented in the assembler, it was not documented as such.

The ALIAS directive was not documented because Microsoft recommends using LINK
5.3 or later and LIB 3.2 or later when producing .EXEs, .DLLs, or library
modules that use this directive. These utilities did not ship until Microsoft
C/C++ 7.0; therefore, because the tools were not available at the time that MASM
6.0 shipped, the directive was not documented.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This feature is useful to map names used in one version of a product to names
used in another version of that product when they have changed. The library
OLDNAMES.LIB that ships with Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 was created to map C
6.0 names to C/C++ 7.0 names and uses this technology.

The syntax for the ALIAS directive is as follows

  ALIAS &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;actual-name&gt;

where the angle brackets are required, alias is the alternate or alias name, and
actual-name is the actual name of the function or procedure. Note that the new
utilities, LINK 5.3 and LIB 3.2, should be used.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.00a 6.00b s_c
