SUMMARY
=======

If you change from a non-Microsoft golf game to Microsoft Golf for Windows, you
may have a problem with the Microsoft swing control. Most other manufacturer's
controls use three mouse clicks: one to start the swing, one to set the power,
and one for the snap. The following instructions are in the Golf Help file.

To take a full swing:

1. Move the pointer onto the Swing button in the Swing Control window. Press and
  hold down the left mouse button to start the swing.

2. When the indicator within the Swing Gauge reaches the green line at 12:00,
  release the left mouse button. A white line marks the release point, and the
  indicator continues to the end of the gauge.

  Note: The point at which you release the mouse button determines the power
  level of the swing. If you release before, or on, the 12:00 mark, your swing
  will be softer and more controlled, making the snap (the second part of the
  swing) more likely to be accurate. If you release in the red area (after the
  12:00 mark), your swing will be more powerful than normal and your snap will
  need to be almost perfect to avoid severely hooking or slicing the shot.

3. The indicator goes to the end of the Swing Gauge, then bounces back around.
  When the indicator reaches the green line at 6:00, click the mouse button
  again. A second white line marks the release point.

  Note: The point at which you click here determines how straight the shot is.
  This is called the snap. If you click before the 6:00 mark, the shot will
  hook to the left; after the 6:00 mark, the shot will slice to the right. The
  severity of the hook or slice depends on both how close you get to the 6:00
  mark, and, how powerfully you swing. The more powerful the swing, the greater
  the hook or slice.
