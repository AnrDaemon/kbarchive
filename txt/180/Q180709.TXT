TITLE   :Code in Main Thread Still Executes After Issuing CTRL+C Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you press CTRL+C, a significant amount of code may still be executed in
the primary thread before the program quits.

CAUSE
=====

If there is a read outstanding to a console device and CTRL+C is pressed, the
Input/Output is cancelled and the read is completed. The thread that issued the
read then continues to run. Sometime later, the CTRL+C event is delivered (in a
different thread) to the Control Event handler which usually causes the process
to exit. The problem is that various amounts of code can execute in the primary
thread before the process ever exits. The amount of code that is executed
depends on the platform speed and processor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
