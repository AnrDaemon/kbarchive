======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server 3.0 Manager does not show which 3270 LUs have not been assigned
to an LU pool. This makes it difficult to determine which LUs are not being
used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the 3270 Pool name appears in the Assigned To field when a
3270 LU is assigned to a Pool. In addition, the Assign To context menu allows
3270 LUs to be assigned to Pools as well as to Users and Workstations.
