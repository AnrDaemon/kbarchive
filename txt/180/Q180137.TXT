======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the SnaNls API to convert data to/from Simplified Chinese, incorrect
character conversion may occur.

CAUSE
=====

The following mapping combinations are duplicated in the Snadbcs.tbl file for
Simplified Chinese, which causes conversion problems for the following
characters:

   ANSI     EBCDIC
   A1E4 <-> 4450
   A3BF <-> 4345
   A3BF <-> 435B
   A3BF <-> 445C

A new conversion table was created for SNA Server, and the duplicate mapping
combinations listed above were removed. The following file was changed to
correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\system\snadbcs.tbl

for Windows NT, Windows 95 and Windows 3.x clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
