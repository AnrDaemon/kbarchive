TITLE   :Access Violation in SNA Manager When Editing DLS Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Remote Link Services and Alternate Link Services fields of the Distributed
Link Service Properties dialog box allow strings longer than 256 characters to
be entered. With SNA Server, 3.0 SP1, SNA Manager generates an Access Violation
if any of these fields are edited with more than 256 characters. With SNA 3.0
SP2, SNA Manager generates an Access Violation if the "Alternate Link Services"
field is edited with more than 256 Characters.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server uses a 255-character long array to handle those fields but the
properties dialog box does not check for the length of the typed string.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION

Each list can have a maximum of 127 remote link services.
