TITLE   :An ATTACH May Fail When Using Set_CPIC_Side_Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When calling Set_CPIC_Side_Information xcmssi(), the parameter Security_User_Id
is 8 bytes long but the APPC layer uses 10 bytes to store the same information.
This means it will carry the last two bytes with a value of 0x0000. In the
ATTACH (FMH-5) message, trailing spaces (0x40 EBCDIC) will be removed and the
actual length of the Security_User_Id value will be set on the Information
Field.

If Security_User_Id is less than 8 bytes, it will be padded with spaces and the
APPC layer will carry <Security_User_Id> + Space(s) + 0x0000. What this
means is that the ATTACH will carry all bytes BEFORE the first space and it will
be accepted by the remote end.

If Security_User_Id is equal to 8 bytes, there won't be any padding and the APPC
layer will carry <Security_User_Id> + 0x0000. The ATTACH will carry all
bytes BEFORE the first Space, in that case <Security_User_Id> + 0x0000.
Because this won't match the user id on the remote end, the ATTACH will fail.

When using the SNA Server Manager to configure CPIC Symbolic Destination Names,
the User ID and Password parameters are correctly padded with spaces up to 10
bytes before passing them to the APPC layer.

CAUSE
=====

The Set_CPIC_Side_Information (xcmssi) function accepts an 8 byte user ID and
password and these needed to be blank padded to 10 bytes before handing to the
APPC layer.

STATUS
======

SP1, and 3.0 SP2.
