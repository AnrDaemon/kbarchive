TITLE   :Scale Font Option Not Working for SNA Server Print Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Print jobs that had printed with the correct font size with SNA Server 3.0 or
3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) may starting printing with a different font size after
you apply SNA Server 3.0 SP2 or upgrade to SNA Server 4.0.

The "Scale Font Size to Fit Printable Page" option in the Print Session Overrides
property page is supposed to scale the font so that the print job always prints
66 lines on an 11-inch page. After you apply SNA Server 3.0 SP2 or install SNA
Server 4.0, this option scales the font based upon the specified font size shown
in the "Use Font Size" box even though this box is unavailable when the "Scale
Font Size to Fit Printable Page" option is selected. If the "Use Font Size" box
is blank, this does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

A regression in SNA Server 3.0 SP2 and SNA Server 4.0 causes the Print Server to
use the font size specified in the "Use Font Size" box when scaling the font
instead of using the LPI (Lines Per Inch) and MPP (Maximum Print Position)
values to determine the font size.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the

MORE INFORMATION

This problem has a noticeable effect for LU3 and 5250 printing, but not for LU1
Printing.
