TITLE   :BUG: Code Outside of Procedures Executes on Application Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Code placed outside of procedures or functions is executed on application
startup.

CAUSE
=====

Neither compiler warnings nor errors are generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not place code other than declarations outside of subs, functions, or event
procedures.

Although this could be used for the same purpose as a SubMain or the Form Load
event, it is strongly recommended that this behavior be avoided to provide
future compatibility.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place the following code in the code module for Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Dim myMessage
         myMessage = "Hello from the Declarations section of Form1."
         MsgBox myMessage

         Private Sub Form_Click()
             MsgBox "Hello from the Form Click event."
         End Sub

         MsgBox "Hello from somewhere else."

         Private Sub Form_Load()
             MsgBox "Hello from the Form Load event."
         End Sub

3. Press F5 to run the project, and note that the message boxes outside of the
   event procedures are executed before the Form Load event.
