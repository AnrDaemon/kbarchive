TITLE   :APPC Partnership Changes May Cause SNA Manager to Disappear
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you are using SNA Server on the Windows NT platform.
After you add or remove several static APPC partnerships from any APPC Mode
Definition within SNA Server Manager, and you save the configuration, you may
get an access violation. This access violation occurs either when you save the
configuration or later when you close the subdomain.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused when Snaadmin.dll fails to properly release the temporary
configuration records it created while editing APPC partnerships.

Some of the functions used to support APPC static partnering create a temporary
edit copy. These functions do not get deleted when cleaning up the records;
Snaadmin.dll ends up with bad pointers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with SNA Server 3.0 Manager
included in Microsoft SNA Server version 3.0 Service Pack 2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
