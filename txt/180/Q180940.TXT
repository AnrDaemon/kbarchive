TITLE   :Unable to Use Host Print Transform After Applying SP2
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The 5250 print server Host Print Transform option does not work correctly after
you apply SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2.

CAUSE
=====

The new PRINTSESSIONAPPC record written when the Host Print Transform is enabled
is not properly setting the PAEXTRA_EXTENDED bit in the dwExtra flag. Therefore,
the 5250 print service creates a 5224 device instead of a 3812 device on the
AS/400.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
