SUMMARY
=======

By default, the 5250 applet displays a vertical bar (|) for the Column
Separator. However, you can change the 5250 applet screen image for a Column
Separator (Screen Attributes) from a vertical bar (|) to an underline (_) by
setting the MapCSMode parameter to 1 in the Win5250.ini file. This capability is
only supported with the 5250 emulator included with SNA Server version 3.0 (or
later).

Additional query words: vertical bar
