SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program when you run the Clean Mailbox
command from the Tools menu, there is a data entry field for deleting all
messages older than a certain number of days. When counting the number of days
for this field, Exchange goes by the time stamp for the mail receipt date, not
the last modified date.

For example, if a particular mail message was received a month ago and is just
modified today by the recipient, the mail message will still be deleted if the
Clean Mailbox command is performed by the administrator with "All messages older
than <number of days>:" set to "10."
