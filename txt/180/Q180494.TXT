TITLE   :BUG: Private Variables in a Module Are Public
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a variable is declared in a module as Private, it is seen throughout the
project as if it were declared Public.

RESOLUTION
==========

Take care when declaring form variables and module variables so that the wrong
variable is not inadvertently addressed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Windows CE project in either eMbedded Visual Basic or Visual
   Basic 6.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a module to the project.

3. In the module, add the following line of code:

    
         Private myMessage

4. Add a command button to Form1.

5. Paste the following code into Form1:

         
         Option Explicit 
         
         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             myMessage = "myMessage is set"
             MsgBox myMessage
         End Sub

6. Press F5 to run the project and note that the Click event has full access to
   the module's private variable. The expected behavior is to get the message
   "Variable not defined."
