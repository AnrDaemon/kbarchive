PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdisplay

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta 98 Research Organizer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Netscape Navigator to browse the contents of the Encarta 98 Research
Organizer CD-ROM, the introductory video clip may be loaded very slowly. In
addition, the instructions describing how to play the introductory video clip do
not apply if you are using Navigator.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Navigator must retrieve an entire video clip
before it can play it. Navigator may take a long time to retrieve the
introductory video clip in Encarta 98 Research Organizer because the size of the
video clip is about 32 megabytes (MB).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The instructions describe how to play the introductory video clip in Microsoft
Internet Explorer, which uses streaming technology to play the video clip as it
is retrieved from the Encarta 98 Research Organizer CD-ROM.

If you want to use Navigator to browse the contents of the Encarta 98 Research
Organizer CD-ROM, you must wait for Navigator to retrieve the entire
introductory video clip from the CD-ROM, and then double-click the video clip to
play it.

Navigator requires about 55 seconds to retrieve the introductory video clip from
a 4x CD-ROM drive, but it can retrieve the video clip from a 12x CD-ROM drive in
less than 18 seconds under ideal conditions.

Netscape Navigator is manufactured by Netscape, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
