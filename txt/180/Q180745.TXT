BUG #: 17795 (6.5)

SYMPTOMS
========

If you perform a join on a multitable view and it exceeds the 16-table limit,
including worktables, an ODBC client will receive the error message:

   MessageText = "[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]The query and
   the views in it exceed the limit of 16 tables."

Any additional query on the same statement or on a new statement using the
version 3.50.305 SQL Server driver will generate the error message:

   MessageText = "[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Connection failure"

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, drop the current connection and reconnect the
client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server Driver
versions 2.65.0252 and 3.50.305. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
