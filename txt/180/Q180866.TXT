TITLE   :Persistent Verification Support for APPC Sessions
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 3.0 does not include support for Persistent Verification (PV), a
method for managing conversation level security on an APPC session. Without PV
support, a sending LU cannot send a password on the first ATTACH and set the PV
bit. The PV bit signals the receiving TP to check the security credentials by
verifying the password.

CAUSE
=====

Persistent Verification support was not implemented in SNA Server 3.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0SP1,
and 3.0SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

PV changes were implemented in SNA Server 4.0 but were not fully retrofitted to
the SNA Server 3.0 product. In addition, modifications to the APPC interface
(Wappc32.dll) were needed to provide correct interaction between PV and Already
Verified (AV) support, which is a second method for managing APPC conversation
level security. With the hotfix applied, if the host will accept AV and PV, and
the APPC application specifies "security = AP_SAME", SNA Server does the
following:

1. If it does not detect that the user is signed on to the host, it sends an
   ATTACH with the AV bit set and the PV bits set to "sign-on requested". A
   password is not included.

2. If it does detect that the user is signed on, it sends an ATTACH with the AV
   bit set and the PV bits set to "already signed on". Again, a password is not
   included.

The most basic way to keep an APPC conversation secure is to send a user_id and
password on each ATTACH, which can then be verified by the receiving LU. The
problem with this is that the password is continuously passed in messages,
increasing the likelihood of its being intercepted. PV and AV both provide a
mechanism for reducing (or removing altogether) the number of messages that
contain the password, and thereby improving security.

For AV the password is never sent on any ATTACH. The receiving LU trusts the
sending LU to have done all of the security checking. If a receiving LU trusts a
sending LU, the sending LU can avoid including the password on any ATTACH by
setting the AV indicator bit instead. The AV bit tells the receiving LU that the
sending LU has already verified the TP's credentials (by some private method)
and the receiving LU does not have to worry about doing any checking itself.

For PV, the password is sent on the first ATTACH, and is never sent again. On the
first ATTACH, the PV bit is set, and a password is included. This signals the
receiving LU to check the password and then add the user_id to a list of users
who do not need to be verified again. On the second and subsequent ATTACHes the
PV bit is set, but no password is included. This signals the receiving TP that
it just needs to check that the user is in the list of users it has verified in
the past.
