TITLE   :XADM: EDB File Size Not Updated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the file size and properties of an Exchange Server database stored
on an NTFS partition, the file size does not reflect the current size, date, or
time until the database service (directory, information store, or directory
synchronization) is stopped and restarted.

CAUSE
=====

Because the *.edb files are locked open, the file properties cannot be updated.
The properties of the drive are reported correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop and restart the corresponding service
(directory, information store, or directory synchronization).


STATUS
======

This is a known problem with Windows NT NTFS partitions and the following
Exchange Server databases:

   Dir.edb, Priv.edb, Pub.edb, and Xdir.edb.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even though the size of the file in question is not updated, the free space on
the drive is updated.

If you are monitoring the file size to determine low disk space conditions, it is
recommended that the free space on the drive be monitored and not the size of
the Exchange Server database files.
