======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a menu is created with the menu editor with an ampersand character (&)
to indicate a shortcut key for the menu, the menu shortcut key does not work in
the emulator. Additionally, the menu shortcut keys will not work on the remote
device unless the form contains a control that can receive focus (such as a
CommandButton).

An example of a shortcut key would be "ALT-F" to access a menu with the caption
of "&File."

NOTE: This problem only exists in the emulation environment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
