PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg osr2 win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you specify a screen saver password that contains more than 14 characters,
one of the following symptoms may occur:

 - If the password contains 15 to 19 characters, the Windows Screen Saver dialog
   box does not appear when you try to stop the screen saver. As a result, you
   can stop the screen saver without typing the screen saver password.

 - If the password contains more than 19 characters, your computer stops
   responding (hangs), or you receive the following error message when you try
   to set the screen saver password:

   MPREXE caused an invalid page fault in module
   MPRSERV.DLL at <address>.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the screen saver password is copied into an improperly
sized internal buffer. If this occurs, internal status code values and values
that are currently stored in memory may be damaged, leading to the symptoms
described earlier.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
