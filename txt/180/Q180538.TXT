TITLE   :SNA Server SDLC Connection Fails to Reactivate After Host IPL
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1,2.11 SP2,3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An SDLC connection from SNA Server to a front-end processor (FEP) remains in a
pending state after the host performs an IPL. The only means of recovery is to
stop and restart the SNA Server service.

SNA Server may post an Event 23 in the Windows NT application event log with a
qualifier of 00A1 or 0025 as a result of these symptoms.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server is erroneously handling the non-activation XIDs sent from the FEP on
an SDLC connection and treating this as a connection outage.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA
Server version 3.0 and 4.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining
these Service Packs, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the Ibmsdlc.DLL interface allows for the correct handling
of SDLC non-activation XIDs.

The SNA Server Ibmsdlc.dll (SDLC Link Service) file supports a "dumb card" driver
interface that is published in the appendix of the SNA Device Interface
Specification (SNADIS) guide. This link service will work with any dumb card
implementation, such as Ibmsync.sys (the IBMSDLC driver), Microgate, DCA ISCA,
Attachmate SDLC, as well as others.

Other SDLC link services implement the full SNADIS interface so the Ibmsdlc.dll
is not used. Some examples of these link services include Eicon SDLC and Barr
SDLC.
