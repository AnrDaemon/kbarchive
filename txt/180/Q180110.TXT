TITLE   :XADM: Directory Export Does Not Append to Existing File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you select Directory export in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program
and specify an existing file as the Export file, the Export function of the
Administrator program overwrites this file without any warnings.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the export process, you may choose to only export mailboxes to the export
file. However, if you then select the same export file and choose to export
Distribution Lists (DL), the DL entries are not appended to the export file as
you may expect. The existing export file is overwritten with the DL exports, and
the original mailbox export file is renamed to filename.Cxx , where "xx"
represents how many times an export has been attempted to the existing filename.
