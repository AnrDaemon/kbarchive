            Command1.Value = False ' Set the Value property back to False.
            MsgBox "Command1.Value = " & Command1.Value
         Else
            Command1.SetFocus   'Set focus to Command1.
         End If
      End Sub

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two CommandButtons to Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
             Command1.Value = False
             MsgBox "Command1.Value = " & Command1.Value
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
             Command1.SetFocus
             MsgBox "Command1.Value = " & Command1.Value
         End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the project.

5. Click Command2 and note that a message box appears that indicates that the
   Value property of Command1 has been set to True.
