======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the WindowState property of a form to '0 - Normal' has no effect.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the form's height and width before changing the WindowState property (such
as Maximizing), and then restore the height and width when desired as follows:

      Option Explicit
      Dim FormHeight
      Dim FormWidth

      Private Sub Form_Load()
         'initialize form size, could be set at design-time also.
         Form1.height = 2000
         Form1.width = 3000
         'Save the form's height and width.
         FormHeight = Form1.Height
         FormWidth = Form1.Width
         Command1.Caption = "Maximized"
         Command2.Caption = "Normal"
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
         Form1.WindowState = 2 'Maximized
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command2_Click()
         'Restore the form's original height and width.
         Form1.Height = FormHeight
         Form1.Width = FormWidth
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Windows CE HPC Pro Project in either eMbedded Visual Basic or
   Visual Basic 6.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two command buttons to Form1, placing them in the upper-left-hand corner
   of the form so they will be visible when the form is resized by the Load
   event of the form.

3. Paste the following code into Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
              Command1.Caption = "Maximized"
              Command2.Caption = "Normal"
              'initialize form size, could be set at design-time also.
              Form1.height = 2000
              Form1.width = 3000
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
              Form1.WindowState = 2 'Maximized
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
              Form1.WindowState = 0 'Normal
         End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the project.

5. Click on Command1 and note that the form is maximized.

6. Click on Command2 and note that the window does not return to its normal
   state.
