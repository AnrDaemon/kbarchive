The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b

SYMPTOMS
========

When the ControlSource property of a text box control is set to the custom
property of a form and the custom property is .NULL., the text in the control
cannot be changed. If the text in the control is edited, the text changes to
.NULL. when the control loses focus.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the class definition in the code below to add the KeyPress method as
follows:

      DEFINE CLASS NewTextBox AS textbox
         PROCEDURE KeyPress
         LPARAMETERS nKeyCode, nShiftAltCtrl
                 *-- Once the text has changed, set the custom
                 *-- property of the form to the text box.
            ThisForm.custom_prop = This.Value
         ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program using the code below that creates a form with a custom
   property and two text boxes. The ControlSource of the first text box is set
   to the form's custom property.

         frmMain = CREATEOBJECT("frmBase")
         frmMain.Show
         READ EVENTS

         DEFINE CLASS frmBase AS Form

              *-- Set the property to a character type.
              custom_prop = ""

              PROCEDURE Init
                  ThisForm.custom_prop = .NULL.
              ENDPROC

              PROCEDURE Unload
            CLEAR EVENTS
         ENDPROC

             *-- Create the text box that gives the problem.
             ADD OBJECT text AS NewTextBox WITH ;
                Left = 100, ;
                Top = 0, ;
                Width = 250, ;
                Name = "txtText",;
                NullDisplay = ".NULL.",;
                ControlSource = "thisform.custom_prop"

            *-- Create another text box to give you something to tab into.
            ADD OBJECT text2 AS TextBox WITH ;
               Left = 100, ;
               Top = 50, ;
               Width = 250, ;
               Name = "txtText2"
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS NewTextBox AS textbox
         ENDDEFINE

2. Run the program and enter text into the first text box.

3. Tab to the next text box.

   The text in the control changes to .NULL.
