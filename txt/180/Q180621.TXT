KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 3.0, including Service Pack 1 (SP1) and SP2, does not include the
Symbol files for the bundled 5250 Applet. Symbol files for the 5250 Applet are
only needed to help troubleshoot application exceptions and Dr. Watson errors
that occur with the 5250 Applet.

SNA Server 3.0 does include Symbol files for all of its other components
including the 3270 Applet.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, and 3.0 SP2. All future versions of SNA Server 3.0 will include the Symbol
files for the 5250 Applet. SNA Server 4.0 already includes the symbol files for
the 5250 Applet.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
