TITLE   :Allocation of Print Server Threads May Cause Delays
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Host Print service's method of allocating threads may result in poor
printing performance if a network printer is extremely busy or becomes
unavailable for some reason.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Print service currently allocates one thread for every 32 print
sessions. In this case, if one printer is slow to respond or is unavailable, the
other print sessions running on the same thread may experience performance
degradation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server Versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, thread allocation is changed to allow for Print Server to
run 1 thread per session for up to 32 sessions. The next 32 sessions will be run
at 2 sessions per thread increasing up to 32 sessions per thread. By running
fewer sessions per thread, potential delays will be minimized.
