======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Help topics for eMbedded Visual Basic (eVB) and Microsoft Windows CE
Toolkit for Visual Basic (VBCE), the description for the "For Each ... Next"
statement is as follows:

"Repeats a group of statements for each element in an array or collection."

However, this is not true for collections because you cannot declare a collection
in either eVB or VBCE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unlike the information presented in the Help documentation, the following code
will not work in either eVB or VBCE because the New keyword is not supported:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
         Dim col As New Collection
         Dim vnt
         col.Add "Item1"
         col.Add "Item2"
         col.Add "Item3"
         col.Add "Item4"
         For Each vnt In col
             MsgBox vnt
         Next
      End Sub
