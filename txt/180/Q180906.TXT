TITLE   :Dial-Up Networking Cannot Dial Local Area Code
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface) 2.1 and
configure a Dial-Up Networking connection to use the local area code when you
dial a phone number, the 10-digit phone number to be dialed may be changed to
contain random or unintelligible characters.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Tapi32.dll file that is installed with the TAPI
2.1 software cannot correctly handle the 10-digit local area code and phone
number.

RESOLUTION
==========


To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Double-click the Dial-Up Networking connection you want to use, and then
   click Dial Properties.

2. Type "000" (without the quotation marks) in the Area Code box, and then click
   OK.

When you type "000" (without the quotation marks) in the Area Code box, the
correct local area code is dialed, but the number to be dialed does not contain
any invalid characters.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
