TITLE   :XCON: Erroneous Deletion of SMTP & SNADS Routes During Routing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience some non-delivery reports (NDRs) when you send messages to
SNADS or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) addresses.

CAUSE
=====

During recalculation of the local routing table, routes that are imported from
other sites may be dropped. This concerns routes of the form "SNADS =" or "SMTP
=" where no routing value is configured.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can temporarily create a LOCAL route that will not be replicated in other
sites.
