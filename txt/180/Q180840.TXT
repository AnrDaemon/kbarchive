======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle (Build 2.06325), version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to create an ODBC data source with the SQLConfigDatasource API
and the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle version 1.0 (Msorcl10.dll), you get one
of error messages listed below.

On Windows 95:

   <APPLICATION.EXE> has caused an invalid page fault in module
   MSORCL10.DLL at 0137:61016bae.

On Windows NT 4.0:

   The instruction at "0x61016bae" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory
   could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

This is a known bug in the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle, version 1.0.
SQLConfigDatasource fails when provided with any invalid attribute string
name/value pair.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use only the proper ODBC data source attribute string values found in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base article listed in the REFERENCES section or get the
updated Oracle ODBC driver version 2.0 that ignores invalid attribute strings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in the Microsoft ODBC for
Oracle driver, version 2.0.

                              "DSN=MSORCL10_DSN\0"     // This is valid.
                              "BOGUS=Yada-Yada-Yada\0" // This is invalid.
