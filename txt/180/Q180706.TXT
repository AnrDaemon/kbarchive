TITLE   :Incoming X.25 Host Connection Indicates Primary Link Role
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an SNA Server X.25 connection is configured for Remote End: Host and
Allowed Directions is configured for Incoming or Both Directions, the SNA Server
notifies the X.25 link service that it has a primary link role when it should
have indicated a secondary link role.

The incorrect X.25 link role is reported to the X.25 link service in the SNA
Server's Open(Link) request. This problem was found by Eicon Technology, though
may occur with any X.25 link service supported by SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server configuration DLL (SNACFG.DLL) was incorrectly defaulting the
X.25 link role when the X.25 connection is configured to support incoming calls.
This caused the SNA Server to indicate a primary link role in error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1), 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SnaBase service must be stopped in order to apply the updated SNA Server
configuration DLL (<snaroot>\system\SNACFG.DLL). Once the updated
SNACFG.DLL is applied, the SNA Server Manager program must be run and the
configuration file must be resaved.
