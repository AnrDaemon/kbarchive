SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to set up permissions using the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program so users can track messages, but not add, modify, or
delete objects in the Exchange directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure a "Message Tracking Only" account, perform the following steps:

1. Run the Microsoft Exchange Program, preferably logged onto Windows NT as the
   Exchange Service Account.

2. From the Tools menu, select Options.

3. Go to the Permissions property page.

4. Select the following options:

    - Show Permissions page for all objects.

    - Display rights for roles on Permissions page

   Click OK to close the property page.

5. Get properties on the Organization object, and select the Permissions page.

6. Select the Windows NT account or group that you want to assign permissions
   to.

7. In the Rights list, deselect all the options.

8. Click OK.

9. Get properties on the Site object, and select the Permissions page.

10. Select the Windows NT account or group that you want to assign the right to
   track messages.

11. From the Roles list, select "View Only Admin."

12. Click OK.

The desired users should now be able to track messages. Because these users have
View Only Admin privileges, they will not be able to add, modify, or delete any
objects in the Exchange directory.
