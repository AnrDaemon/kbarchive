TITLE   :Reg.exe DELETE and UPDATE Functions Do Not Work as Expected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Registry Manipulation Utility (Reg.exe) 1.0 included with the
Microsoft Windows NT Server Version 4.0 Resource Kit, Supplement Two, the
following symptoms occur:

 - When you use the DELETE function with the /F or /f parameter, the program
   prompts you for deletion even though the online help states that these
   parameters provide for the creation of batch files for automating the
   deletion of registry entries without user confirmation.

 - When you use the UPDATE function to modify a DWORD or BINARY registry value,
   you receive the following error message:

   DWORD Value:

   BUGBUG: Need to deal with 32 bit numbers

   BINARY Value:

   BUGBUG: Need to deal with binary data

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, obtain Registry Manipulation Utility 1.05 from the
following Microsoft FTP site:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/i386

NOTE: Registry Manipulation Utility 1.05 is contained in the self- extracting
archive file, Reg_x86.exe.

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. At a command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER

   " cd <drive>:\<ntreskit>" (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the drive letter on which Windows NT Server Version 4.0
   Resource Kit, Supplement Two is installed, and <ntreskit> is the folder
   in which Windows NT Server Version 4.0 Resource Kit, Supplement Two is
   installed.

2. At a command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER:

   " edit confirm.txt" (without the quotation marks)

3. Type the letter Y, and then press ENTER.

4. Press ALT+F, press S (to save), and then press X (to exit).

5. At a command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER:

   " reg delete hklm\Software\MyCo\MyApp\Timeout < confirm.txt" (without the
   quotation marks)

This causes the prompt to delete the registry key or value to be automatically
answered "Yes."

MORE INFORMATION
