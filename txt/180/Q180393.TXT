KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Data Replicator, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: WINDOWS NT :174 (1.0)

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Replication History Log Limit Field is set to a number less than the
number of subscriptions, but greater than zero, CPU usage will increase to 100
percent. This high CPU usage will continue until the Replication History Log
Limit Field is set to a number greater then the number of subscriptions or to
zero.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a Replication History Log Limit that is greater
then the number of subscriptions. Alternatively, zero can be used to disable the
History Log.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Host Data Replicator version
1.0.
