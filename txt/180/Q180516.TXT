PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a master document to a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, the
subdocuments are not saved to the server. Only the master document is saved to
the FTP site.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the master document to a local or network drive and copy the files to the
FTP server.

   -or-

Save the document in Rich Text Format (RTF). This forces Word to write out each
member of the master document to disk, starting with the master document and
proceeding with each subdocument.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Master Document feature in Word allows you to have one master document
containing many subdocuments. When you save the master document, a unique name
is created for the subdocuments in the same directory as the master document.
