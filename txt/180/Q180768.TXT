1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a Label to Form1, set its BackColor to blue, and its BackStyle to "0 -
   Transparent."

3. Add the following code to the form module:

         Private Sub Form_Click()
            Form1.BackColor = vbRed
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Form1.BackColor = vbGreen
         End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the project and note that the Label BackColor is set to the
   form's BackColor, green.

RESULT: Click the form and note that the form's BackColor changes to red, whereas
the label's BackColor remains green.
