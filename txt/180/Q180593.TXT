======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 4.2b, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 4.2b, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While Visual C++ is running, renaming a project's directory fails even though
the project has been closed.

CAUSE
=====

The project .ncb file remains open even after the project is closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Open another project, or close Visual C++ Developer Studio.

If renaming the directory still fails, and Visual C++ previously crashed [general
protection (GP) fault], consult Task Manager for a running process named
Msdev.exe and end the process.

If renaming still fails, another task may have a file open in that directory or
one of its subdirectories. Find and close that task.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a directory named C:\MyTest.

2. In Visual C++, on the File menu, click New and start a new MFC AppWizard
   project located in C:\MyTest. Click Finish, then click OK.

3. On the File menu, click Close Workspace.

4. Using Windows Explorer, try to rename C:\MyTest.

RESULTS: Windows Explorer reports a sharing violation.
