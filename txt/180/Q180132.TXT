Users tool is added to Control Panel. You can use this tool to remove a family
member's user profile in Windows 95, which also removes the family member from
Protect It!.

NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows 98, Internet Explorer 4.0 is already
installed.

Internet Explorer version 4.0 is available free of charge from the following
Microsoft Web site:

After you install Internet Explorer, you can remove a family member by following
these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Users.

3. On the User List tab, click the name of the family member you want to remove,
   and then click Delete.
