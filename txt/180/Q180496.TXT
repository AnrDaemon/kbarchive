TITLE   :BUG: Lines Drawn on Form Disappear After Menu Covers Them
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a menu drops down and covers lines drawn directly on a form, the line that
is covered will not be repainted correctly. This behavior also occurs with the
CommandBar and MenuBar controls.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, redraw the line in the Click event of the submenu. For
example, if you have a File menu with a submenu named "New," add the following
code for the "New" submenu Click event:

      Private Sub mnuNew_Click()
         'Normal New menu code here
         Drawline 0,0,1000,1000   'Redraw line.
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE Handheld PC Pro Project in either eMbedded Visual
   Basic or Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Components and select the CommandBar control.

3. Add a CommandBar control and a Command Button to Form1.

4. Add the following code to Form1:

       Option Explicit

          Private Sub Command1_Click()
              DrawLine 0, 0, 1000, 1000
          End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Dim mnuMain As CommandbarLib.CommandBarMenuBar
       Dim mnuFile As CommandbarLib.Item
       
       Set mnuMain = CommandBar1.Controls.Add(cbrMenuBar, "MainMenu")
       
       'add File menu items
       Set mnuFile = mnuMain.Items.Add(1, "File", "File")
           mnuFile.SubItems.Add , "Open", "Open"
           mnuFile.SubItems.Add , "Add", "Add"
           mnuFile.SubItems.Add , "Update", "Update"
           mnuFile.SubItems.Add , "Delete", "Delete"
   End Sub

5. Press F5 to run the project.

6. Click on the CommandButton to draw a line.

7. Select an option on the submenu and note that either all or part of the line
   does not get repainted.
