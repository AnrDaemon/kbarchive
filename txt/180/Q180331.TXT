SYMPTOMS
========

If you change folders to a folder with a long file name using quotation marks
(") to specify the long file name in an MS-DOS prompt session and then attempt
to redirect (>) a file in that folder to the printer port (LPT1), you may
receive the following error message:

   File Creation Error

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, change folders to the folder with the long file
name by using the folder's short file name alias. For example, to change to the
C:\My Long File Folder folder, use the following command:

   cd mylong~1

Then, use the redirect command. For example:

   type myfile.fil > lpt1

Additional query words: send copy
