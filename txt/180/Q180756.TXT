TITLE   :PRB: Alignment Property of TextBox Always Aligns to the Left
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the Alignment property of a TextBox, it has no affect on the
justification of the text placed inside a TextBox. The text always appears
justified on the left. This happens both on the Windows CE device and within the
emulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the MultiLine property of the Textbox to True.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ES_RIGHT and ES_CENTER edit styles in Windows CE are only supported when the
MultiLine property is set to True.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. On Form1, draw three TextBoxes (Text1, Text2 and Text3).

3. Set the Alignment properties of the Textboxes as follows:

    - Text1 = 0 - Left Justify
    - Text2 = 1 - Right Justify
    - Text3 = 2 - Center

4. Press F5 to run the application and note that the default text in each
   textbox appears on the left.
