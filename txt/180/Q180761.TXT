OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbOSWinCEsearch kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Windows CE version 2.11 for the Handheld PC 
    - Microsoft Windows CE version 2.11 for the Palm-size PC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A line control can be drawn on a frame control at design-time, but it is not
visible at run-time.

RESOLUTION
==========

One workaround that affects only horizontal and vertical lines is to use a frame
control instead of a line control. The caption property of this frame should be
removed.

When creating a horizontal line, set the height of the frame to 90 and the width
of the frame to the desired width of the line needed. For vertical lines, set
the width of the frame to 15 and the height of the frame to the desired line
length.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE HPC Pro Project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded
   Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a frame control to Form1.

3. Draw one or more line controls onto the frame control.

4. Press F5to Run the project and note that the line control(s) is not visible.
