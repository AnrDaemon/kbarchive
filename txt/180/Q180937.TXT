TITLE   :Reset Button Problems in Print Session Properties
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Reset button included on the Printing tab of the Print Session Properties
page is always available (not grayed out). This option is only used when a print
session is configured to print to a file and if the "Unique Filename Extension:"
option is selected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1
and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the Reset (unique file extension) button is enabled only
if:

 - Print To File is selected.

 - The "Unique Filename Extension" option is selected.

 - The current extension is non-zero.

The reset button is available (not grayed out) once the following value in the
registry becomes non-zero:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNA Print Server
   \Sessions\FileExtension 0

Selecting Reset sets it back to zero. The print service will increment this value
every time it prints a job on this session.
