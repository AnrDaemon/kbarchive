TITLE   :HTMLA: Host Header Name Information Not Kept in New Web Site
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a Virtual Web Server on a computer running Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0, using the Internet Service
Manager (HTML), the interface indicates that the information was saved with no
error, but when you try to start the Web, the following error message appears:

   The service could not be started because it is not correctly
   configured. Make sure its server bindings do not conflict
   with other servers running on the same machine. (-2147023843-).

or a shorter message saying there is a problem with bindings.

CAUSE
=====

The above message indicates that this Web's definitions conflict with those of
an already existing Web. Analysis shows that the Host Header Name field is now
empty, even though the information was saved in an earlier step.

When you use the Microsoft Management Console-based Internet Service Manager
(ISM), this same procedure works fine. The Host Header name entered using this
tool works fine.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the Microsoft Management Console-based ISM,
which does not exhibit this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your client connection is exhibiting any of these types of behavior, please
obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.

This fix should have the following time stamp:

   IIS 4.0
   02/06/98 12:38p      14,495   Iivs.asp (Intel)
   02/06/98 12:38p      8,727    Iimltihd (Intel)

After you apply the fix, shut down your system properly and restart it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 4.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix.

Please contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
