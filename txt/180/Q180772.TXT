PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the WindowState property of a form to "2 - Maximized," you can move
the form by clicking on the titlebar and dragging it.

RESOLUTION
==========

The standard for Windows CE applications is to have no titlebar on maximized
forms. To do this, set the BorderStyle property of the Form to "0 - None" and
the Windowstate property to "2 - Maximized." Be sure to include a button, menu,
or some other means of closing the form (for example, using the Hide method or
the App.End method).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
