feed character in an LU3 print job, based upon IBM specifications for LU3
printing.

SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To suppress the space that is inserted after a form feed in LU3 printing, follow
these steps:

1. Apply the hotfix.

2. Start the Windows NT Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and find the following
   key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaPrint\
   Parameters\ Add the following entry to this key: Value Name: NoSpaceAfterFF
   Data Type: REG_SZ String: TRUE

NOTE #1: The String is case-sensitive and must be set to TRUE for it to

            function correctly.


NOTE #2: If this registry parameter does not exist or if it is set to anything
other then TRUE, a space will be added after all form feeds contained in the LU3
print data.
