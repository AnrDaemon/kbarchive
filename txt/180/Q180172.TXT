PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When calling the SignOn method of the MAPISession control, the following error
may occur:

   Run-Time Error '32003' Login has failed.

CAUSE
=====

The LogonUI property of the MAPISession control is set to False and the UserName
property of the control contains an invalid profile name or is empty.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the UserName Property of the MAPISession control equal to a profile name
that exists on the machine before the SignOn method of the control is called.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MAPI 1.0 specification requires a profile to log on to a messaging session.
The MAPISession control was written before the MAPI 1.0 specification was
established. In order to use this control to establish a MAPI 1.0 session and
prevent the Choose Profile dialog box from being displayed, the Username
property must be used to pass the name of the profile needed to sign on.
