KEYWORDS:word97 kbtable

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Keep Lines Together paragraph formatting does not work for paragraphs within a
table if "Allow Row to Break Across Pages" is also selected.

NOTE: To locate the "Allow Row to Break Across Pages" option, choose Cell Height
And Width from the Table menu.

WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this problem, remove the "Allow row to break across pages" option
for either the specific table row or the entire table. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. With the insertion point inside the table, click Select Table on the Table
   menu.

2. On the Table menu, click Cell Height And Width, and click the Row tab.

3. Click to clear the "Allow row to break across pages" check box.

For more information about changing how a table breaks across pages, click the
Office Assistant, type "break table row," click Search, and then click to view
"Prevent a table row from breaking across pages."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Keep Lines Together formatting prevents a page break from occurring within a
paragraph. In effect, if all of the lines of a single paragraph will not fit on
a page, then all of the lines of that paragraph are moved to the next page of
your document. However, this functionality is ignored in a table when the "Allow
row to break across pages" option is selected.

For more information about how to apply Keep Lines Together formatting, click the
Office Assistant, type Keep Lines Together, click Search, and then click to view
Keep Lines Together.

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
