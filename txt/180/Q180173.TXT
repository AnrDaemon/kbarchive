TITLE   :PRB: "The profile name is not valid" with MAPISession Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When calling the SignOn method of the MAPISession control, the following error
may occur:

   The profile name is not valid. Enter a valid profile name.

CAUSE
=====

The LogonUI property of the MAPISession control is set to True and the UserName
property of the control contains an invalid profile name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either set the UserName property of the MAPISession control equal to a profile
name that exists on the machine before the SignOn method of the control is
called, or leave the UserName property empty.

If the UserName property is empty and the SignOn method is called, a Choose
Profile dialog box may appear. This dialog box contains all the profiles
currently available.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MAPI 1.0 specification requires a profile to log on to a messaging session.
The MAPISession control was written before the MAPI 1.0 specification was
established. In order to use this control to establish a MAPI 1.0 session and
prevent the Choose Profile dialog from showing, the UserName property must be
used to pass the name of the profile needed to sign on.
