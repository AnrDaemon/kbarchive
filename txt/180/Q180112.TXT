SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use the Import/Export feature in the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program to export the creation date of directory objects
such as mailboxes, custom recipients, and distribution lists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To export the creation date, follow theses steps:

1. Create an export file (for example, Test.csv) with the following header:

         Obj-Class, Directory Name, When-Created

2. From the Administrator program, go to Tools and select Directory Export.

3. For the export filename, select the file created in Step 1 (Test.csv).

4. Select the desired container and export objects, and then click Export.

The program should now export the creation date for each object in the selected
container.

Note: The date/time exported is in universal time and is not formatted; for
example, 980120211543Z corresponds to 1/20/98 3:15PM CST.

To export the date when an object was last changed, add "When- Changed" to the
header of the export, and then export.
