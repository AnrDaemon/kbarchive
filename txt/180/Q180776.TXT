TITLE   :Windows Messaging Does Not Change Addresses to Hyperlinks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: In this article, the term "Windows Messaging" refers to both
Microsoft Windows Messaging and Microsoft Exchange.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type a Web, Mailto, file transfer protocol (FTP), Gopher, or shell
folder address in a Windows Messaging e-mail message, nothing happens when you
click it.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Windows Messaging does not change these types of
addresses into hyperlinks.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Use one of the following e-mail programs instead of Windows Messaging:

 - Microsoft Outlook

 - Microsoft Exchange Server Client (retail version)

 - Microsoft Internet Mail (included in Microsoft Internet Mail and News)

 - Microsoft Outlook Express

Method 2
--------

Use a word processor (such as Microsoft Word 97) that provides this functionality
as your default e-mail editor. For information about whether your word processor
provides this functionality and can be configured as your default e-mail editor,
consult the documentation included with your word processor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A shell folder is a resource on your local hard disk or local area network (LAN)
that can be accessed using the "File:" protocol (for example,
"file://c:\windows" or "file://\\<path>\webpage.htm," where <path>
is the full universal naming convention (UNC) path to the Webpage.htm file).
