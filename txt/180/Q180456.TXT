The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

When a Variant array is passed as a parameter, one of the following errors might
occur:

   Subscript out of range.

   File1.WriteFields sData

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in eMbedded Visual Basic or Visual Basic 6.0.
   Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, click Components, select "Microsoft CE File System
   Control", and click OK.

3. Add a File control and a Command Button to Form1.

4. Paste the following code in to Form1:

         Dim sData()
         Dim iLoop

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            On Error Resume Next
            'Build Array
            ReDim sData(3)
            For iLoop = 0 To 3
                sData(iLoop) = "Some Text" & iLoop
            Next
            File1.Open "\test.txt", 2
            File1.WriteFields sData()   'This line generates an error.
            MsgBox Err.Number & " " & Err.Description
            File1.Close
        End Sub

5. Press F5 to run the project and note that a message box appears indicating
   that error 9 "subscript out of range" occurred.
