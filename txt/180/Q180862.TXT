SYMPTOMS
========

A single form feed (FF) that is sent by the host on a LU3 printer session is
ignored by the SNA Print Server.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Print Service is designed to execute a form feed (FF) included in
an LU3 print job when any of the following conditions are met:

 - If the FF is inserted as the first character after the WCC in a 3270
   Erase/Write or Erase/Write Alternate command.

 - If the FF is located after a valid NL (New Line) order.

 - If the FF is located after the last printable character position of any print
   line.

This is by design according to IBM's 3270 Information Display System manual.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack and the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the following

Add the following entry to this key:

   

   Value Name: DoAllLU3FFs

   String: TRUE

this registry entry is to remove it.
