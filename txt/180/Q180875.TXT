TITLE   :Russian Clients May Have File I/O Problems on an FPNW Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Services for NetWare version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If your MS-DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, or Windows NT client uses a
Russian version of the operating system, or if the Russian system default locale
is installed, you may experience one or more of the following problems while
accessing a Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) server:

 - After you create a directory with Russian characters using a Novell NetWare
   redirector and refresh the view in Windows NT Explorer, all directories that
   do not contain Russian characters disappear.

 - If you create a directory containing Russian characters on an FPNW server,
   you may see a name similar to "3c5a8~1". This name disappears if you refresh
   the screen and the correct directory name is displayed.

 - You cannot create a new directory on an FPNW server because, if you try to
   rename the default folder name ("---------") to any other name, you receive
   an error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
