When you attempt to create a phonebook entry to dial another country, you may
find that the country you want to call is not in the Country Code list.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this issue you can add new country codes using the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe).

2. Go to the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ 
   Currentversion\Telephony\Country List

3. Create a new key named for the country code that is provided by your
   telephone provider.

4. Within the new key you created in step 3, create the following values:

   Value Name: CountryCode
   Data Type : REG_DWORD
   Data      : <country code in decimal>

   Value Name: Name
   Data Type : REG_SZ
   Data      : <Country name>

   Value Name: SameAreaRule
   Data Type : REG_SZ
   Data      : <provided by telephone provider>

   Value Name: LongDistanceRule
   Data Type : REG_SZ
   Data      : <provided by telephone provider>

   Value Name: InternationalRule
   Date Type : REG_SZ
   Data      : <provided by telephone provider>

5. Restart your computer for the new country to appear in the Country Code list.
