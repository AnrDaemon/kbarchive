The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a message via the Internet Mail Service (Internet Mail
Connector in version 4.0), you may receive the following non-delivery report
(NDR):

   A mail message was not sent due to a protocol error.
   554 (not a type writer)
   Input line to submit longer than 254 characters

   "Unable to deliver the message due to a communications failure"

CAUSE
=====

This error has been reported when a message has been sent to a distribution list
containing hundreds of names. The message destined for another Exchange Server
computer was being routed through another SMTP host called Secure Message Guard,
that was unable to handle more than 254 characters on the To: line. The error is
due to a limitation of the Secure Message Guard host.

WORKAROUND
==========

Limit the character length on the message To: line to fewer than 254 characters.
