PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.0;win95:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbide kbVC kbVC500bug kbVC600fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The AppWizard, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the New Projects dialog box, the Platforms box is empty both initially and
after you click Back from the next step in the wizard.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Select another project type. The appropriate platform options will appear.

2. Re-select the project type you wish to use.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the AppWizard creates a project configured for the Win32 platform.
The platform type for project configurations specifies the operating
environment. It also specifies the default settings required by the selected
platform, including settings that the compiler uses for the source files, the
default locations for output files, and so on. And, it specifies the tools
required to build the final output files for that platform.

After creating a new project with the wizard, the active configuration will be
Win32 Debug. Select Settings from the Project menu to change the configuration
settings. Select Set Active Configuration from the Build menu to choose the
default configuration for the build.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual C++ select New from the File menu.

2. Click on the Projects tab.

   NOTE: The Platforms box is empty. (The first wizard, ATL COM AppWizard, is
   selected by default).

3. Choose MFC AppWizard(exe).

4. Type a project name.

5. Click Ok.

6. Click Back.
