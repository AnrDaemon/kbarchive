TITLE   :XADM: Remote Monitoring Increases Open Handles on Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Performance Monitor and connect to a remote Microsoft Exchange
Server computer, the number of handles open on the server increases. When you
quit Performance Monitor, the number of handles open on the server decreases,
but it may still be higher than before you connected to the server. If you
repeatedly start and quit Performance Monitor remotely, the increase in the
number of open handles may be significant.

This problem also occurs with other programs that are used to remotely monitor
the performance of a Microsoft Exchange Server computer. The problem does not
occur when you use Performance Monitor locally.

CAUSE
=====

When a program connects to the registry on a remote server to obtain information
about the server's performance, multiple handles are opened by one or more
Microsoft Exchange Server dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). When the connection
ends, the DLLs do not properly close the handles.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, use Performance Monitor locally instead
of remotely.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a program connects to a remote registry to obtain performance information,
it uses a different method than it uses to connect to the local registry. The
problem described in this article only occurs when the remote method is used.
