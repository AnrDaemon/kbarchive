TITLE   :TPs Can't Be Invoked On Windows 95/NT Clients if One TP Ends

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If multiple instances of the same invokable APPC/CPI-C TP are running on a SNA
Server Client for Windows 95 or Windows NT, the active TPs cannot be invoked if
one instance of the TP ends for any reason.

SNA Server will log the following event in the Windows NT Application Event Log
when attempting to invoke one of the remaining active TPs on the Windows 95 or
Windows NT client:

   Event ID: 60
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Failed to invoke APPC TP <TP Name>, sense data = 084C0000

The 084C0000 refers to AP_TRANS_PGM_NOT_AVAIL_NO_RETRY.

CAUSE
=====

When an invokable APPC TP is started on a client, SnaBase sends an update
message to the client's sponsor SNA Server. The SNA Server adds the TP to its
local service table; this entry is used for routing incoming DLOAD messages to
the client. When the TP ends, the client SnaBase sends another update message to
the sponsor server asking the SNA Server to remove the TP from its service
table. These messages, both add and remove, are sent for each instance of the TP
running on the client. The SNA Server only keeps one instance of the TP in its
service table no matter how many instances are running on the client. When one
instance of the TPs ends, the SNA Server marks the TP listed in the service
table as inactive, which means none of the other TPs on the client can be
invoked by the partner TP.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.0, 2.1,
2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the SNA Server Clients for Windows 95 and Windows NT are
updated so that the update message to remove a TP from the service table on the
SNA Server is only sent after the last instance of the TP ends.

NOTE: There are other possible causes for this event, which are not related to
this particular issue. For additional information, please see the following
