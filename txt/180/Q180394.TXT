PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Data Replicator, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: WINDOWS NT:196 (1.0)

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a subscription while the destination connection is down, you will
receive an error. The error occurs when you select the destination. Host Data
Replicator tries to fill in the destination table information.

After the destination connection is resolved, backing up to the Criteria dialog
box and then moving forward to the Destination dialog box will not update the
destination table information. If the destination table information is not
updated when you click the Next button, you will receive the following error
message:

   Please Enter A Table Name

CAUSE
=====

The Next button in the Criteria dialog box does not request destination table
information from the destination system.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two ways to request destination table information.

 - Double-click the destination server icon. Choose the destination DSN. Verify
   that the password is correct, and then click OK.

 - Click modify. Choose the destination DSN. Verify that the password is
   correct, and then click OK.

After the destination table information is filled in, you will be able to
continue creating the subscription by clicking the Next button.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Host Data Replicator version
1.0.

NOTE: Effective immediately, Microsoft has granted exclusive marketing and
distribution rights to StarQuest Software for Host Data Replicator 1.1, a
