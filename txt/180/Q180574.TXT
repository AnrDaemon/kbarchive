TITLE   :Client Fails if WNAP Started Using /User: and /Pwd: Options
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows 3.x SNA Server client fails to get an application session if you start
Wnap.exe with /User: /Pwd: specified on the command line. When this occurs while
you are using the 3270 Applet included with SNA Server, the following message is
displayed on the 3270 Applet status bar:

   No SNA Server Found in Domain.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 3.x client is not storing the password specified in the /Pwd:
command line parameter for use after WNAP initializes. Because the password is
not available when the application session starts, the user account cannot be
validated by SNA Server. This prevents the application session from opening.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Start Wnap.exe without using the /User and /Pwd: options.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 Service
Pack 1 (SP1) and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
