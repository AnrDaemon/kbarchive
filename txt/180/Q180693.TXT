TITLE   :IPX Clients Fail to Obtain A Sponsor Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading an SNA Server 2.11 Windows NT or Windows 95 client workstation
(attached via Netware IPX/SPX) to SNA Server 3.0, 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or
SP2, the workstation may fail to obtain a sponsor connection to an SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

An SNA Server 3.0 Windows NT or Windows 95 client may issue a Get General Server
query in an attempt to locate a sponsor SNA server. When the client workstation
receives the query reply, it will attempt to contact the first server in the
list that is provided. The client will then create an IPX connection to the
remote server and query the bindery for the address of the sponsor server. In
certain situations, possibly due to SAP filtering strategies, the remote bindery
based server will not have the IPX address and SAP type (0x444) registered for
the intended SNA Server and the connection attempt will fail.

STATUS
======

A correction has been made to the SNA Server client IPX interface (SNANCP.DLL)
which forces the SNA IPX client to query with a Get Nearest Server request first
before attempting to use a Get General Server query.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1,
and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

This problem is fixed in the original retail release of SNA Server 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With this SNA Server client update applied, the following registry entry can be
used to force the client to use only Get General Server queries if required. It
also works with SNA Server version 4.0.

Subtree:   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 Key:       \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters\SnaSpx
