PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a custom ActiveX control using Microsoft Visual Basic, you get the
following error when setting the CanGetFocus of the UserControl object to
False:

   Can't have child controls capable of receiving focus on a UserControl whose
   CanGetFocus property is False.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

 - Remove all controls that can receive focus.

-or-

 - Set the UserControl's Enabled property to False instead of setting the
   CanGetFocus property.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Microsoft Visual Basic, create a new ActiveX Control project.

2. Add a Textbox to the form.

3. Click on the background of the UserControl to select it, and then change the
   CanGetFocus property from True to False. The following message will be
   displayed:

   Can't have child controls capable of receiving focus on a UserControl whose
   CanGetFocus property is False.

   NOTE: If you try step 3 prior to step 2, all controls in the ToolBox capable
   of receiving focus will be disabled so you will be unable to add the textbox.
