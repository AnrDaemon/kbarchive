PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft SNA Server is trying to dial out too quickly and not giving the
MicroGate SDLC adapter and modem time to reset the interface leads. The SDLC
link service should implement a hold-down timer after dropping DTR before it
raises it. SNA Server will log an event similar to the following when this
problem occurs:

   Event ID: 175
   Description: Modem shows DSR before dialing, for connection <connection
   name> through link service <link service name>.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once the update is applied, SNA Server will have a default delay of 5,000 ms (5
seconds) once DTR is dropped to allow time for the SDLC adapter and modem to
reset the interface leads. To configure this delay:

1. Apply the hotfix.

2. Start the Windows NT Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and find the following
   key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet \Services\SnaSDLC1\Parameters\

3. Add the following entry to this key:

   Value Name: DropDTRDelay
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   String: <delay in milliseconds>

The MicroGate SDLC adapter is manufactured by MicroGate, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
