PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:8.0; :8.0,8.01,8.02,8.03
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Outlook client to view a nested replica of a public folder, you
may not be able to view the information even though you have proper permissions
to the folder. The following error may occur:

   Unable to expand the folder. The Set of folders could not be opened.
   The contents of this public folder are currently unavailable. Either
   the Microsoft Exchange Server computer servicing this public folder
   is down or the public folder has not been replicated to this site.
   See your Administrator.

WORKAROUND
==========

To be able to view and use the public folders properly, you may use either of
the following methods:

   Install and use the Exchange client to view and post messages to the nested
   public folder(s). The Exchange Server client allows access to the nested
   replica of the public folder(s), assuming permissions are correct.

   -or-

   From the Exchange Administrator program, replicate the entire public folder
   hierarchy that contains the nested public folder(s) from the original
   Exchange site to your other Exchange site(s). This will allow Outlook clients
   in this Exchange site to access the nested public folder(s) replicas.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
