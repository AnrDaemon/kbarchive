TITLE   :APPC Printing Misinterprets ASCII Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During printing, the parser prematurely terminates the ASCII Transparent
section, and begins to interpret the data as SCS codes. When this occurs, the
SNA Print service may log the following event in the Windows NT Application
Event Log:

   Event ID: 4101
   Source: PPV5250
   Description: SCS parser has detected a parameter error.

CAUSE
=====

The Closeprinter routine is not setting a pointer to NULL, which may cause calls
to open a print session to fail at a later time. This results in Print Server
losing track of its position in the datastream, causing some of the data to be
misinterpreted as SCS codes instead of transparent data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
