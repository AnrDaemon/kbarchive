SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to print from an Active Document (DocObject) server
while the server is in-place activated in an Active Document container.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Active Document server provides a mechanism for viewing the contents of a
document within a single container, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or
Microsoft Office Binder. Active documents are displayed in the entire client
area of the container, are involved in menu merging, and are always in-place
active.

Microsoft Visual C++ provides an AppWizard that can help you create an Active
Document server implemented using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC).

When an Active document is in-place activated, a user may want to print the
contents of the document using the Print menu item available on the container
File menu. To provide this functionality in an MFC Active document server,
perform the following steps:

1. Declare an OLE command map in the declaration file for your
   COleServerDoc-derived class as follows:

         class CMyOleServerDoc : public COleServerDoc
         {
            ...
         protected:
            DECLARE_OLECMD_MAP()
         };

2. Implement the OLE command map in the implementation file for your
   COleServerDoc-derived class as follows:

         BEGIN_OLECMD_MAP(CMyOleServerDoc, COleServerDoc)
            ON_OLECMD_PRINT()    // Implements OLE printing
         END_OLECMD_MAP()
