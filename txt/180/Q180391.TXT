TITLE   :PRB: ScrollBars Appear Incorrectly in Run-Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you place a horizontal or vertical ScrollBar on a form and make it small,
the ScrollBar may either appear or not appear with arrows, depending on the size
of the control and the device that is targeted.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs because of the way that Windows CE handles the painting of
the control.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in eMbedded Visual Basic or Visual Basic 6.0.
   Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a Vertical ScrollBar to Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            VScroll1.Height = 450
         End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the project, and note that no arrows appear in the ScrollBar.

5. Change the code above to read:

        Private Sub Form_Load()
              VScroll1.Height = 250
        End Sub

6. Press F5 to run the project, and note that the ScrollBar is longer drawn on
   the form.
