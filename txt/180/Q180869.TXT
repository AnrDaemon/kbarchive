TITLE   :Unable to Start Print Sessions Until Print Service Restarted
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Print sessions defined in the SNA Server Print Service may go to an Inactive or
Pending state requiring the print server be restarted to reactivate the
sessions. This may occur with both LU1 and LU3 printing. The SNA Server Print
Server may send a badly formatted Open PLU Response to the SNA Server service
that the SNA Server will reject.

CAUSE
=====

An uninitialized field in the SNA Server Print Service could cause the sending
of a badly formatted OPEN PLU RSP to the SNA Server service, which logs an error
and rejects it. This causes the print session to fail to activate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1), 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
