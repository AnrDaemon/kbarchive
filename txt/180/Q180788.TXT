KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you move a user from one Windows NT group to another, SNA Server does not
recognize the change made to the user's group until the SNABase service is
stopped and restarted. This can cause unexpected user connectivity problems if
access to SNA Server 3270 or APPC resources are controlled through membership
within Windows NT user groups.

CAUSE
=====

SnaBase only maintains SID information for the specific User Account in its
internal SID Cache within the SnaBase service. The SID Cache does not maintain
SID information based on groups that users may belong to.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack




SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

   S E R V P A C K

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0
Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The update corrects the problem by allowing the SID Cache to store either the
User SID or the Group SID.
