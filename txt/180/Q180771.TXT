TITLE   :PRB: Enabled Property of Label Does Not Change Appearance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the Enabled property of a Label control to False does not change the
appearance of the label (grayed out) as expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to add code to handle the appearance of the label control
whenever setting the Enabled property to False, and also to add code to restore
its appearance when setting the Enabled property to True. For example:

   'To disable a label:
   Label1.ForeColor = vb3DShadow
   Label1.Enabled = False

   'To enable a label:
   Label1.ForeColor = vbWindowText
   Label1.Enabled = True

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Changing the Enabled property of a control causes two actions: a change in
availability to the user and a change in visual appearance.

When a control-Enabled property is set to False, the control is not available
(cannot receive the focus) and the appearance becomes grayed out to indicate
unavailability.

Changing the Enabled property of a Label control affects the availability of the
control, but it does not change the appearance to match. The code in the
RESOLUTION section of this article correctly alters the appearance and
availability.
