TITLE   :Start Button Not Disabled Using Snap-in Interface
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following problem occurs when you use the SNA Server 4.0 snap-in
administrative interface to the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). If the start
button in SNA Server version 4.0 is used to start a service, the start button
will remain disabled after the service has been started. If you use the mouse to
click on another location and then back, the button will reflect the correct
status.

Starting an already started service leaves it pending indefinitely. The same
situation applies when stopping a service and when using the Save Config button.
This problem does not occur when you use the SNA Server 4.0 Manager interface.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
