TITLE   :APPC or CPIC Performance Is Degraded When Using Host Security
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an APPC or CPIC application uses LU6.2 conversational security with the SNA
Server host security integration feature, performance may be degraded in
unexpected ways. For example, when measuring transaction throughput with
multiple concurrent requests, a single LU6.2 conversation may take longer to
complete than multiple concurrent LU6.2 conversation requests.

This problem was initially found while beta testing SNA Server 4.0's COM
Transaction Integrator (COMTI), when configured to use LU6.2 conversation
security in conjunction with the SNA Server Host Security integration feature.

NOTE: While this problem was fixed in the SNA Server 4.0 general release, the
problem can occur with other APPC or CPIC applications which run over SNA Server
3.0 (including 3.0 SP1 or 3.0 SP2).

CAUSE
=====

When the SNA Server communicates with the Host Security Integration service, to
retrieve a replicated or mapped username or password, the SNA Server's callback
function is not being signalled properly, leading to an average 2.5 second
delay.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0, 3.0 SP1,
and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
