TITLE   :XFOR: Unable to Send Bitmap in Body of Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message with a large bitmap in the body of the message from
Exchange Server 5.5 to Lotus Notes 4.5, using the Exchange Notes Connector, when
the message reaches the Notes user, the pasted bitmap is missing from the body
of the message. In the Notes Inbox, the message shows a paper clip indicating an
attachment, but the attachment is nowhere to be found.

The following eight errors are logged in the Browse Log of the Exchange
Connectivity Administrator:

   Message Number: 31500
   Message: Sender: Test User - Exchange, size 160152, Message ID: c=US; a=

   message failed.

   Message Number 41360
   Message: Error {Invalid syntax}; adding COMPOSITE BODY item to Notes
   Message failed.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is the result of a previous version of Lotus Notes API being exposed
to a store OLE2 object that was less than 64 KB. If you attach small bitmaps in
the body of the message, then you will not experience the problem.

This problem is fixed in the Lotus Notes Client version 4.5.2 and later.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, upgrade the Lotus Notes client on the Exchange
Connector server to version 4.5.2 or later. It is also recommended that you
upgrade the workstation Notes client to version 4.5.2 or later.
