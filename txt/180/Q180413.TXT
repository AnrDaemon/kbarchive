SUMMARY
=======

The TN5250 Server on an SNA Server computer may use local and remote LUs from
another SNA Server computer in the domain instead of the LUs defined on the SNA
Server computer where the TN5250 Server is running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Configuration of the TN5250 Server requires local and remote LU aliases to be
entered. If these LUs are available on the local computer, they will be used.
However, if the LUs are not available on the local SNA Server computer (such as
when the local SNA Server service is not started), another SNA Server computer
in the SNA domain with the required LUs can be used. Thus, the TN5250 Server can
be dependent on another SNA Server system in the SNA domain. Failure of either
of these SNA Server computers causes the TN5250 Server to fail.

To prevent this dependency from occurring, configure LU aliases for use by the
TN5250 Server that are unique in the SNA domain. For example, use "local1" for
the local LU alias on the first server, "local2" for the local LU alias on the
second server, and so on. Note that this only applies to the local and remote LU
aliases used by the TN5250 Server. Duplicate LU aliases must be used for the
purpose of hot backup, as explained in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q128244,
"SNA Server Load Balancing and Hot Backup."
