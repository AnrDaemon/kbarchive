TITLE   :DHCP Clients Unable to Obtain IP Lease from DHCP Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When your Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) clients attempt to lease or
renew IP lease information, they may receive the following error message:

   No DHCP server available.

NOTE: Your DHCP server is correctly configured and operating. A network trace
captured at your DHCP server shows it is receiving the DHCP discovery packets
from the clients but it does not offer any leases.

CAUSE
=====

Your DHCP server is configured to be a DHCP Relay Agent in addition to a DHCP
server. This causes the DHCP server to forward any DHCP Discover packets to
another server without responding directly to the DHCP client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the DHCP Relay Agent configuration using the
following steps on your DHCP server:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network, click the Protocols tab, and double-click TCP/IP
   Protocol.

3. Click the DHCP Relay tab.

4. Remove all IP addresses listed in the DHCP Servers list by clicking each
   address and then clicking Remove.
