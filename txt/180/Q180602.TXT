The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer running both Windows NT Server and Routing and Remote Access
Service (RRAS) may fail to start and one or more of the following events are
logged in Event Viewer:

   Event ID   : 20103
   Source     : Router
   Description: Unable to load C:\WINNT\system32\ipxrtmgr.dll.

-or-

   Event ID   : 20133
   Source     : IPXRouterManager
   Description: The description for Event ID (20133) in Source
                (IPXRouterManager) could not be found.  It contains the
                following insertion string(s):.


-or-

   Event ID   : 7024
   Source     : Service Control Manager
   Description: The Routing And Remote Access Service service terminated
                with service-specific error 1003.

CAUSE
=====

When RRAS is installed on a multihomed server (one that has two or more network
interfaces) and Auto Frame Type Detection is enabled for the NWlink IPX/SPX
Compatible Transport, the bindings may not be correctly enumerated for the
IPXRouterManager in the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following steps:

1. Manually set the internal network number and specify Manual Frame Type
   Detection for the properties of the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport.

   For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q150546
   TITLE : NWLink IPX/SPX: Network Number vs. Internal Network Number

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Network, click the Services tab, and click Routing and Remote
   Access.

4. Click Update and specify the location of the RRAS folder.

   NOTE: By default, this folder is C:\Program Files\Routing.
