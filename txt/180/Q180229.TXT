TITLE   :Calling CONVERT Before RECEIVE_ALLOCATE May Lead to Event 60
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If WinAPPCStartup() is not included at the beginning of a Windows-based
invokable transaction program, and if the TP first calls the CONVERT API, the
TP's call to RECEIVE_ALLOCATE may subsequently stop (hang) and not complete.

CAUSE
=====

By first calling the CONVERT API prior to calling RECEIVE_ALLOCATE, the SNA
client APPC interface was being confused, causing it to fail to properly match
the incoming attach request to the application's RECEIVE_ALLOCATE call. If a
Windows-based transaction program does not begin with WinAPPCStartup(), SNA
Server automatically calls WinAPPCStartup() when the application calls the first
APPC function. However, if this call is preceded by a Common Service Verb
function (such as CONVERT), this can confuse the APPC interface.

WORKAROUND
==========

The application can work around this problem by explicitly calling
WinAPPCStartup prior to calling any Common Service Verb functions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
