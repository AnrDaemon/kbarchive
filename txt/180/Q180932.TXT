-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server Manager may prevent a user from making changes to the configuration
file even though the user has been granted WRITE permission through the Config
File Security folder in the SNA subdomain properties.

WORKAROUND
==========

In addition to granting a user WRITE permissions, the users must also be granted
the right to MANAGE AUDITING AND SECURITY LOG within the Windows NT User Manager
Policy/User Rights folder, which can be found under Policies in the User
Manager. This must be done on both the user's local Windows NT computer (if the
SNA Server resides on a Windows NT standalone or member server) and in the
Windows NT domain.
