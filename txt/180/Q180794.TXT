SUMMARY
=======

When you delete zones from DNS Manager, the Domain Name Service (DNS) in Windows
NT Server does not actually delete the zone files.

When you create DNS zones using DNS Manager, the information is stored in .dns
files located in your %SystemRoot%\System32\DNS folder. When DNS Manager deletes
zones it does not remove these files; they still exist in the DNS folder. To
recover the original zone information, re-create your zones using the exact
names for the zones and the zone files. DNS Manager will load the .dns files and
all of the previous information will appear.
