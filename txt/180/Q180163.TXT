TITLE   :INI/CFG Files Corruption w/ Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:_IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user application is installed using the Add/Remove Programs tool in
Control Panel, the application-specific INI and CFG files are copied to the
Windows folder.

If the application is installed using the "All users begin with common
application settings" option the application-specific INI and/or CFG files are
propagated to each user's personal Windows folder
(%SystemRoot%\Profiles\<user name>\Windows).

If any of the INI or CFG files have a line containing more than 512 characters,
the files may not be copied correctly, resulting in the destination files
containing corrupted data. When this happens, the application works as normal in
Install mode (change user /install) but may not work correctly in Execute
(default) mode.

CAUSE
=====

Terminal Server does not properly handle a line having more than 512 characters
in INI and CFG files. The designed limit for line length is 1,024 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
