TITLE   :SGCINST.EXE Appears to Execute but SGC Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.0,4.0,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Sgcinst.exe appears to execute but SGC does not work.

CAUSE
=====

VeriSign used to include the certificate, the intermediate certificates, and the
root certificate. They stopped sending the root certificate since it was
redundant and ignored. Sgcinst.exe fails because it believes the intermediate
certificate was really the root certificate.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) update. For
more information on how to obtain the updated version of Schannel.dll, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
