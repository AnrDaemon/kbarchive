-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Word 2000 
 - Microsoft Word 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you enter a large number of AutoCorrect entries (for example, 7000 entries),
you may receive an "Out of Memory" or other memory error.

CAUSE
=====

AutoCorrect entries are stored in an index file attached to the Normal.dot file,
and use a minimum of 4 bytes per entry. Because the AutoCorrect feature uses the
64K local memory heap allocated to Word, inserting large numbers of AutoCorrect
entries may result in an "Out of memory" error message. For example, when you
create 7000 AutoCorrect entries, you use approximately 28K of memory--almost
half the available local memory. This could also result in other memory-related
error messages because the local memory is used by several other operations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AutoCorrect feature automatically corrects common typing mistakes as you
work. For example, if you type "adn," AutoCorrect replaces it with "and" as soon
as you press the SPACEBAR.

You can also use AutoCorrect to quickly insert words or phrases that are long or
difficult to type. For example, use AutoCorrect to automatically replace "FYI"
with "For Your Information." AutoCorrect entries are stored in the Ms097.acl
file.

The operating limits of the AutoCorrect feature for Microsoft Word are listed in
the following table.
