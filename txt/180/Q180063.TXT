SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to add a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) Server to WINS

   The WINS Server whose IP address you have specified below cannot be
   validated.

If you type the NetBIOS name of that WINS Server and then click OK, you may
receive the following error message:

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the account you are using does not have administrative
permissions on the remote WINS Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Have the Administrator of the remote WINS Server add you to its local
adminstrators group

Method 2
--------

Make a connection to the IPC$ share on the remote WINS Server using an account
that has administrative permissions on the remote WINS Server.


NOTE: If your WINS Servers need to communicate across a router, an Lmhosts file
may be necessary. For additional information, see the following article in the
