TITLE   :SBS WinNT Workstation Client Has Server Service Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup sbs

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Microsoft Small Business Server client setup disk on a
workstation running Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3, the following error
message may be displayed on restarting:

   Service Control Manager
   -----------------------
   At least one service or driver failed during system startup.
   Use Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

The event viewer may have two logs pertaining to this error as follows:

   Event ID: 7023
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Description: The Server service terminated with the following error:
                Not enough server storage is available to process this
                command.

   Event ID: 7001
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Description: The Computer browser service depends on the server
                service which failed to start because of the following
                error:  Not enough server storage is available to
                process this command.

CAUSE
=====

After the client setup procedure finishes, the user is prompted to reinstall
Service Pack 3. Failing to reinstall SP3 when prompted following the Windows NT
Workstation client setup will prevent Computer Browser and Server services from
starting thereafter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, reinstall Service Pack 3 on the Windows NT
Workstation client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft BackOffice Small
Business Server Version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post
additional information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
