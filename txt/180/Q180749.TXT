======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Form in a project has been disabled (Enabled property = False) the Shortcut
keys to the last menu item of the first top-level menu are not disabled. Note
that this happens only in emulation mode and not on the device itself.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

NOTE: The Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 provides a command bar control
that does not have this problem.

Steps To Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE (HPC) Project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. When the Project Properties dialog window appears, keep all the default
   properties and click OK.

3. On the Tools menu, select Menu Editor.

4. In the Menu Editor dialog, enter the following properties:

   Caption: File
   Name: mnuFile

5. Click Next, and then enter the following properties:

   Caption: Open
   Name: mnuFileOpen
   Shortcut: CTRL + Q

6. Click the RIGHT ARROW key to make mnuFileOpen a submenu item to mnuFile.

7. Click Next, and then enter the following properties:

   Caption: Close
   Name: mnuFileClose
   Shortcut: CTRL + W

8. Click the RIGHT ARROW key to make mnuFileClose a submenu item to mnuFile.

9. Click OK to dismiss the Menu Editor.

10. Add the following code to Form1:

         Private Sub mnuFileOpen_Click()
            MsgBox "mnuFileOpen"
            Form1.Enabled = True
         End Sub

         Private Sub mnuFileClose_Click()
            MsgBox "mnuFileClose"
            Form1.Enabled = True
         End Sub

11. Set the Enabled property of Form1 to False.

12. Press F5 to run the project.

13. Press the shortcut key for the File...Close menu (CTRL+W), and note that the
   menu item select event fires.
