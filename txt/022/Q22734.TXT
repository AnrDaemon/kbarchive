SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a dot-matrix printer that is not connected to your personal computer,
and you first print Microsoft Windows files to an output file on a disk and then
you use the standard Print command on the computer connected to the printer to
print the files, your files do not print properly.

CAUSE
=====

Because Windows places a dot-matrix printer in graphics mode when it prints, the
print output file you create is a binary file with graphics information.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of using the standard Print command, you should use the COPY command
with the /B option to send the binary print file to the printer.

For example, if your printer was connected to LPT1 and you are trying to send a
binary print file named PR.PRN to the printer, type the following:

   " copy pr.prn lpt1: /b" (without the quotation marks)

Use this same method to print any document when you use the Print to File option
at the application level.

REFERENCES
==========

See your MS-DOS manual for more information on the COPY command.
