SUMMARY
=======

The Windows SDK API NetBIOSCall() is provided as an interface for application
developers using network communication protocols.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NetBIOSCall() translates to an interrupt 5Ch call and is handled by the
Virtual NetBIOS driver under 386 enhanced mode Windows or by the MS-DOS Extender
(DOSX.EXE) under standard mode.

The interface provides for both synchronous and asynchronous NetBIOS commands.

When asynchronous commands are used, there are two rules that an application
developer must follow:

 - The POST routine provided to the network control block (NCB) MUST be in a
   fixed code segment in a DLL (dynamic-link library).

   This is necessary because the asynchronous event could complete while a BIOS
   operation is in progress. Because the BIOS is used to reload segments, if the
   event occurred while in the BIOS, it would not be possible to reload a
   not-present segment. A FIXED code segment in a DLL remains fixed and
   page-locked in memory at all times.

 - The NCB and associated read or write buffer for asynchronous commands must be
   allocated as GMEM_FIXED from within a DLL. This ensures that the buffers will
   be page-locked.

It is recommended that synchronous commands not be used if a comparable
asynchronous command is available. Synchronous NetBIOS() commands cause the
entire Windows system to halt until the command completes.
