The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 2.2, 3.0, 3.11, 3.14, 4.0, 4.01, 4.05, 4.1 
 - Microsoft CodeView for OS/2, versions 2.2, 3.0, 3.11, 3.12, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Debug a program that does EGA, VGA, or SVGA graphics. When you continue from a
breakpoint after the program has painted the screen, the screen appears
differently than before the breakpoint; all colors seemingly have been turned to
black. The program is using the EGA in 640x350, 16-color mode.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is partly related to the size of the buffer that CodeView creates
for storing screen information. If you are running on a CGA, EGA, or VGA board,
this buffer is 16K by default. If you are running on a monochrome board, this
buffer is 4K by default. As you are finding, 16K is not enough memory for a
color image using 640x350 resolution (the maximum resolution supported is
640x200), hence the loss of color after the breakpoint.

RESOLUTION
==========

The best way to work around this limitation is to use a dual-monitor setup for
debugging applications that run in a high resolution graphics mode. Invoke
CodeView with the /2 switch and the CodeView display will appear on the
secondary monitor while the program's graphical output will remain on the main
monitor. Because the output is going to a different screen, CodeView won't have
to worry about changing the video modes or the buffering.
