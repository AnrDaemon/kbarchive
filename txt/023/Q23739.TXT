SUMMARY
=======

To compile a file with any of the Microsoft language compilers listed above,
list any appropriate compiler option switches on the command line before the
names of the source files to which the options apply.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are using a Microsoft 16-bit C/C++ compiler, if you specify an option
at the end of the command line, after the names of all the files, the compiler
does not generate any warnings or errors -- it simply ignores the option because
no source file follows for the option to apply to. In a few cases, a trailing
option causes an error because the option conflicts with a previously specified
option.

Microsoft 32-bit C/C++ compiler supports placing option switches after the names
of source files. If a compiler command line specifies more than one source code
file, specified options apply to all files regardless of the position of the
option switch relative to the source filename. However, if the -link switch is
to be used, it must occur after all source filenames and compiler switches.
