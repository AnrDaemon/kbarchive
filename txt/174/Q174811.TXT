SUMMARY
=======

This article is a pointer to a white paper available for download. The white
paper discusses Windows NT security as it relates to Internet Information Server
(IIS) so that you can effectively troubleshoot security- related problems. It
covers the three forms of authentication, how they differ, several ways of
controlling access to key areas on your Web server, and the important, but
almost universally misunderstood, concept of "delegation." Understanding
delegation is mandatory for anyone building a data driven Web site using IIS.
Understanding how Windows NT handles different "users" will potentially save you
days or weeks of troubleshooting.
