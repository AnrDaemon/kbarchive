SYMPTOMS

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

When you use the Microsoft Exchange X.400 connector over an X.25 card to connect
to another system, you may receive the following error messages when you try to
open an association to another system:

CAUSE
=====

This problem usually occurs when associations over the X.25 WAN adapter are
already open, and the card is simply busy. By default, the Exchange message
transfer agent (MTA) attempts to use up to 20 X.25 two-way virtual circuits.
With the Eicon WAN adapter, the WAN Services for Windows NT software sets the
default two-way virtual circuits to four. Therefore, when the MTA makes four
associations the card will no longer accept open associations.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the MTA from attempting to open an association over a busy X.25 card,
use of the following two methods:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Change the default two-way virtual circuits value for the MTA from 20 to 4 to
   reflect the default setting of the Eicon WAN adapter. To do this, edit the
   Windows NT registry and make the following adjustment:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA
      \Parameters
      Eicon X.25 Connections

   Change the default two-way virtual circuits value for the MTA to match the
   Eicon default of 4 or whatever the Eicon two-way virtual circuits value is
   set to.

-OR-

2. Use the WAN Services for Windows NT to change the WAN adapter to 20 to match
   the MTA default value.
