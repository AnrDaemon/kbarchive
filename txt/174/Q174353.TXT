The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Client and Outlook users who use more than one workstation
can set up an offline storage file (OST) to share between computers. The OST is
usable from either system, but can only be used on one computer at a time. This
can be useful for the individual who works in the office at a desktop system
connected to the local area network (LAN) intermittently, and also works from a
laptop computer at a remote location connected to an RAS server intermittently
or not at all. The same OST file can be used for both systems, which can prevent
problems with synchronization of sent or received items from either computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up an OST to share between computers, follow the steps:

1. On the first computer, install the Exchange Client or Outlook Client.

2. Right click on the Inbox icon and select Properties.

3. Select Add to add a new profile for the client.

4. Follow the Exchange setup wizard to select the information services needed
   for this profile, and indicate the server where your account exists.

5. Select No for the option, "Do you travel with this computer," and finish
   creating the profile.

6. Next, select Properties, and highlight Microsoft Exchange Server.

7. Select Properties on the Advanced tab, and choose Offline folder settings.
   The settings will default to Exchange.ost for the offline file name. This may
   be changed as needed.

8. Click OK, and the new file will be created.

9. Open the Exchange or Outlook Client and select Tools.

10. Synchronize all folders from the Menu toolbar. You may also want to Download
   the Offline Address Book at this time.

11. Exit and log off the client.

12. Copy the OST file that you created to the second computer, which will be
   used remotely. Make sure that Exchange Client or Outlook Client is set up on
   this computer in the same manner as described above, with the Offline
   Storage File settings pointing to the OST file copied from the first
   computer.

13. Connect to the Exchange Server computer from the remote system by opening
   the client and synchronizing one time. This will pass the security
   credentials of the individual's profile to the Exchange Server computer,
   allowing access to the OST on the second computer. This OST can be used in
   whatever manner an OST would normally be used.

14. From the second computer, synchronize the OST before moving it to the first
   computer to ensure that the server copy of messages is current. Then from
   the first computer, the OST file can be copied to the system (overwriting
   the initial OST) and then opened and synchronized to send any messages or
   changes made to it.

Public folders are another popular feature with offline folder users. Favorites
from public folders can be synchronized while online, and then used off-line in
the same manner as the private folders. Using this OST that has been copied from
one computer to another will not affect opening Favorites from public folders.
