SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Server accounts created for custom recipients (CRs) cannot be deleted
with Directory Import. This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Directory Import allows you to create Windows NT Server accounts when you
specify them for custom recipients. However, Windows NT accounts are only
deleted when you delete mailboxes. It is a common scenario that a Windows NT
account and a mailbox are so closely coupled that deleting one implies deleting
the other. However, it is unlikely that the same can be said for a custom
recipient and a Windows NT account, especially in the case where the
relationship is one Windows NT account to many custom recipients. Additional
query word: CR
