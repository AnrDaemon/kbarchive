TITLE   :Detection of IntelliPoint Mouse on Serial Adapter Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT does not detect the IntelliPoint (wheel) mouse if using a serial
adapter. It will detect a serial mouse or a PS/2 mouse, but, if the PS/2-style
IntelliPoint mouse has a serial adapter, Windows NT does not detect it. If a
serial mouse driver was previously installed, Windows NT will use it; however,
the Mouse tool in Control Panel shows the mouse type as Unknown and the Change
button is grayed out.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Plug and Play service is not handling the migration of the mouse and
keyboard devices at each boot properly. Windows NT installs the device as class
Unknown instead of class Mouse. And, after the device type is set to Unknown,
Windows NT stops trying to detect it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix below, or wait for the next service
pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
