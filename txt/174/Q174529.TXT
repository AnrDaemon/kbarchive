======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The newest NetFlex 3 cards that ship with some Compaq computers are not detected
during Windows NT setup. The drivers for these cards have the same name as the
drivers for the old NetFlex 3 cards, and also work with the old NetFlex 3 cards.
Replacing the old NetFlex 3 drivers with the new NetFlex 3 drivers in the
I386\Drvlib.nic folder does not allow the new drivers to be loaded for the old
cards.


CAUSE
=====

The Netoemdh.inf that ships with Windows NT does not support these new cards or
drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Compaq has supplied a new Netoemdh.inf that allows Windows NT to detect and load
the drivers for these new cards, and allows the new drivers to be loaded for the
older NetFlex 3 cards as well. Follow the steps below:

1. Delete the existing Netoemdh.in_ file from the I386 folder on the
   distribution share.

2. Download the new driver files from:

   http://www.compaq.com/support/files/desktops/us/software/791.html

3. Replace the files in the I386\Drvlib.nic\Netflex3 folder with the updated
   driver files from Compaq.
