TITLE   :XADM: Counter Increases While Propagating Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, when you are changing user
rights for a group of public folders and you select the Propagate These
Properties to All Subfolders option on the General tab, a progress indicator
counts from 0 to the number of folders. The following message is displayed
during this process:

   xxx folders to be processed. This could take some time (where xxx is a
   counter)

The counter increases from 0 to total number of folders, whereas the expected
behavior would be a counter that decrements.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. When this message is being displayed, the subfolders are
being counted, which is why the number is increasing.
