The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to explain the steps you perform when you run a
knowledge consistency check (KCC) on a Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run a KCC either automatically or from the directory service general
page of a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, perform the following checks and
steps:

1. Bind to the local server.

2. Determine the names of other Exchange Server computers in the local server's
   site.

3. Bind to another server in the site.

4. Check whether this second server has the same server name as any that were
   obtained in Step 2. If not, synchronize the Configuration naming contexts in
   both directions, and repeat with another server until they are all done or
   one of the server names matches.

5. Search the local server for all the writable naming contexts (NC).

6. For each NC, check that there are Reps-to and Reps-from values for each
   server in the site. Fix any missing links.

7. Search the local directory under the local site's directory-replication
   container for connectors.

8. For each connector found, determine whether there is a corresponding remote
   connector locally. In other words, see whether there is a replica of the
   connector in the other site that points back to your local site.

9. If there is a local copy of the remote connector, update the inbound sites on
   the local connector to match the remote connector's outbound sites.

10. Go through the local connectors and construct a list of all sites replicated
   in from all the connectors.

11. Go through the connectors and ensure that they all replicate out all of the
   inbound sites, plus your local site, minus the sites coming in on that
   connector.

12. Search the local directory service for non-writable replicas.

13. Check that you have all the replicas described by the local connectors, add
   any that are missing, and remove any that you should not have.

14. Search the local directory service for authorizations.

15. Verify that you have all the authorizations as described by the connectors,
   and remove any that you should not have.

16. Check that for each intersite replica that you replicate to this directory
   service, you replicate on to all other servers in the site. Remove any
   replicas to non-existent servers.

17. Take replication responsibility for objects last modified by servers that
   have been removed from the site. This is done on a random basis to avoid all
   the servers in the site adopting the same server's objects at the same time.
