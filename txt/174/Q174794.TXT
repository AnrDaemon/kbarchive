SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Cluster Server provides the ability to change the priority, change the
role, or use configured networks for cluster communications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internal cluster data will be transmitted on the highest priority and available
network. You may designate detected networks for the following roles:

 - Use for all communications

 - Use only for internal cluster communications

 - Use only for client access

Use the procedure below to adjust network priority for internal cluster
communications or to change network designations:

1. Right-click the cluster name. The name is at the top level of the resource or
   group tree in the left portion of the Cluster Administrator window (above the
   Groups folder).

2. Select Properties.

3. Select the Network Priority tab.

4. Adjust network priority for internal cluster communications as needed with
   the up and down arrows provided.

5. To adjust the role of the network, select the appropriate network and click
   Properties. If you do not want to change the role of the network or whether
   it is enabled for cluster use, do not perform this step. Otherwise, adjust
   the network properties as preferred for your configuration.

6. When you are finished, click OK.

NOTE: It is important to allow for internal cluster communications as well as
client communications. A typical configuration with two network adapters would
allow all communications on the system's primary network adapter and internal
cluster communications only on the secondary adapter. The secondary adapter
would have the highest priority for cluster communications and would allow the
primary adapter to assume this role if the secondary adapter fails.
