TITLE   :SMSINST: Use of the RESTART Variable in SMS Installer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup smsinst

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer uses a predefined variable called
RESTART in determining whether or not a system should be restarted at the end of
an installation script. The variable can be set manually in an installation
script or changed automatically by the SMS Installer run- time when certain
conditions are met. Restart variables are case sensitive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The variable RESTART can be set to any of the following values:

 - W (a restart of Windows will be performed)
 - S (a warm-boot of the system will be performed)
 - E <MS-DOS program name> (the MS-DOS program will be executed during the
   restart)

The RESTART variable is set automatically by using a number of script items
including, but not limited to:

 - Add Command to Autoexec.bat
 - Add Command to Config.sys
 - Add Device to System.ini

The RESTART variable is also set automatically if you replace any files in use.
SMS Installer copies the new version of the file into the destination directory
under a temporary filename. After the system is restarted, the original file to
be replaced is deleted and the new file is renamed.

To determine which file is causing the RESTART variable to be set, you can place
a "Display Message %RESTART%" script item after each system file that is being
installed. If a letter S is displayed, a file in use has been marked for
replacement on restart.

To suppress the reboot altogether, include a script item at the end of your
script:

   Script Item:   Set Variable
   Variable:      RESTART
   New Value:     (leave blank, this will set it to null)
   Operation:     Nothing

NOTE: If the system is restarted manually, the files in use will still be
replaced at that time.

Conversely, to force a system restart, you may set the RESTART variable to S.
