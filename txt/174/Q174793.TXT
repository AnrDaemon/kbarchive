TITLE   :SMS: SETLS Domain Enumeration Using Smsls.ini and Win.ini
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you specify domain:sitecode in the [SMS] section of the Win.ini file, SETLS
always enumerates the domain. That is, SETLS does not select a Systems
Management Server logon server from the [Servers] section of the client's
Sms.ini file. This results in a longer delay during the initial logon.

CAUSE
=====

SETLS enumerates the domain when there is a mismatch between the KeyMatch value
set in the [SMSLSIni] section of the client's Sms.ini file and the current
value.

For example, suppose the following is the [SMS] section from a client's Win.ini
file:

      [SMS]
      domain=VIPER_X:Q45

The following is the [SMSLSIni] section of the client's Sms.ini file:

      [SMSLSIni]
      ValidatingServer=\\Servername
      FileName=Z:\smsls.ini
      FileTime=31fa4fc0
      SectionMatch=WIN.INI
      KeyMatch=VIPER_X
      Domain=VIPER_X

Note that the domain name under the [SMS] section is VIPER_X:Q45 and the KeyMatch
value under the [SMSLSIni] section is VIPER_X. SETLS enumerates the VIPER_X
domain as long as those two values are different.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually modify the [SMSLSIni] section and change
the KeyMatch value to equal the same value set for the domain entry under the
[SMS] section in the client's Win.ini file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base

MORE INFORMATION
================

As long as the values in the [SMSLSIni] section of the client's Sms.ini file
match the current values, SETLS should select a Systems Management Server logon
server from the [Servers] section of that file, and should not enumerate the
domain.

NOTE: The behavior of Setls has changed in SMS SP4. For additional information
