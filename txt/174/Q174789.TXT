TITLE   :Perl Script Gets Access Denied Error on IIS
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:2.00 3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a Perl script on a "secure" web page, Internet Information Server
(IIS) returns the following error message:

   Access Denied.

However, the Perl script will work correctly if the page were allowed Anonymous
Access.

CAUSE
=====

If the web server has a "secured" section where only authorized users have been
granted access, and you set up a Perl script to run in that area, it will fail.

The IIS server will first try to access the page as the anonymous user. When the
application or page is denied access, it must return a request to the web server
for the authorized user information. However, the Perl interpreter does not do
this; therefore, the script fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run one copy of the Perl interpreter for the Anonymous Access section of the web
site and another copy of the Perl interpreter for the Secured Access section of
the web site.

1. Create two directories in the \perl5\ directory named \bin-anonymous\ and
   \bin-secure\.

2. Copy the contents of the \perl5\bin\ directory to the \bin-anonymous\ and the
   \bin-secure\ directories.

3. Give the IUSR_machine-name account Read (RX) permissions to the
   \bin-anonymous\ directory.

4. Give the Secured Access user accounts Read (RX) permissions to the
   \bin-secure\ directory.

5. Open your registry and add the following values.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System
   \CurrentControlSet
   \Services
   \W3SVC
   \Parameters
   \Script Map
   .pla, REG_SZ: C:\Program Files\perl5\bin-anonymous\perl300.dll
   "Anonymous Access" scripts will be given this extension.
   .pls, REG_SZ: C:\Program Files\perl5\bin-secure\perl300.dll
   "Secured Access" scripts will be given this extension.

6. Stop and restart your IIS services.

7. Rename the Perl scripts in your Anonymous Access directories to the *.pla
   extension.

8. Rename the Perl scripts in your Secured Access directories to the *.pls
   extension.

9. Modify your links.
