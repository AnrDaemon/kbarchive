TITLE   :XFOR: OLE Objects Larger Than 1 MB Not Migrated into Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are migrating user data from Novell GroupWise into Microsoft Exchange,
messages with OLE objects or links greater than 1 MB in size will not be
migrated. Larger OLE objects (>1 MB) do not migrate at all and register an
error in the Event Log.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard is currently unable to process OLE
objects larger than 1 MB when they originate from Novell GroupWise.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Smaller OLE objects (<1 MB), when imported into Exchange, will act
differently, depending on the client and the operating system you use to view
them.
