TITLE   :WD97: Error Expanding Subdocuments If Network Connection Lost
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you lose your network connection, Microsoft Word 97 cannot find or expand any
subdocuments until you restart the Expand Subdocuments command (by clicking the
Expand Subdocuments button on the Master Document toolbar). If a master document
and its subdocuments are located on a network drive and you lose your network
connection, when you reestablish the connection, Word displays the following
message for each subdocument to be expanded:

   The subdocument \\<path name>\<file name> is missing. Do you want
   to expand the master document without this document?

If you click No, the Expand Subdocuments command stops running. If you click Yes,
Word attempts to expand the next collapsed subdocument, and displays the same
error message again.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this error message after losing your network connection, end the
Expand Subdocuments command to prevent expanding the remaining collapsed
subdocuments. To do this, click No in the error message described earlier.

NOTE: The Expand Subdocuments command will also end after the last collapsed
subdocument in the master document receives the error.

After ending the Expand Subdocuments command, you must reestablish your network
connection before restarting the Expand Subdocuments command. The remaining
collapsed subdocuments should now expand correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
