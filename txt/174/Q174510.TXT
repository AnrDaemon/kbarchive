TITLE   :Print Job Corruption Printing on Fast Hardware Across Slow Link
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When "Start printing immediately" is selected on the Scheduling tab of Printer
properties, print jobs may be corrupted if the client connection speed is slower
when compared to the printing hardware.

CAUSE
=====

Print job data is sent to the print device faster than the client can queue data
to the print spooler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the .spl file is examined, the file size is the same as the source file;
however, a portion of the *.spl file is "padded" with 0x00 instead of only data
received from the client. This may be caused by a flow control problem on the
"slow link" from the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
