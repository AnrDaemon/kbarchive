The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

As with most of the Windows NT services, you can administer a Windows NT Domain
Name Service (DNS) Server remotely from a computer running Windows NT that is
not running the DNS Server. This article discusses the method for accomplishing
this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remotely administer a Windows NT DNS Server, you will need to copy the DNS
Manager, Dnsadmin.exe, to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder of the target
computer where you will do the administration. Dnsadmin.exe can be found in one
of the following locations:

 - In the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder of your current Windows NT DNS Server.

   -or-

 - In the <platform> folder of your original Windows NT CD. To expand the
   DNS Manager from this CD, you will need to insert your Windows NT CD into
   your CD-ROM drive, type the following at a command prompt, and then press
   Enter:

      expand D:\<platform>\Dnsadmin.ex_ C:\Winnt\System32\Dnsadmin.exe

   where D: is the letter of your CD drive and C:\Winnt is the folder your target
   Windows NT installation is located.

NOTE: The computer that you wish to run Dnsadmin.exe from must have the TCP/IP
protocol installed and configured correctly and you must have local
Administrative privileges at the DNS Server that you wish to administer.
