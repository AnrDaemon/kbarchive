SYMPTOMS
========

If an LU3 type print job is submitted to Microsoft SNA Server after an LU1 print
job has completed, the data printed will be corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Print Service was not resetting its 'job is transparent' flag
between LU1 and LU3 print jobs.

RESOLUTION

so that it will correctly print LU3 print jobs after LU1 print jobs have been
printed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and
3.0sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
