TITLE   :XFOR: Message Reprocessed Due to Error 80040C15-F0000000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange Server computer receives a message with a recognized character
set, it reprocesses the message to Message.txt. The following warning is written
to the event log:

   Event ID: 12035
   Source: MSEchangeNNTP
   Type: Warning
   Category: Content Engine
   Message with subject subject text from name had to be reprocessed due to error
   80040C15-F0000000.

CAUSE
=====

It is not possible to assume a default character set (for example, US- ASCII),
because if the message truly contains some characters that do not map to the
chosen default character set, then the message is corrupted. The character sets
here are "x-mac-roman" and "Macintosh."

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create an alias in the MIME database to map the
unknown character sets to a known character set.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

Additional query words: Character set
