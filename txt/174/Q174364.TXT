SUMMARY
=======

When you fly the Bell 206B JetRanger III helicopter with a force feedback
joystick, you do not feel force feedback immediately.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following force feedback is available from Microsoft Flight Simulator 98:

 - Control Surface Forces

 - Stick Shaker

 - Crash Effects

 - Ground Bumps

 - Retractable Gear Thumps

The helicopter does not have retractable landing gear nor does it roll down the
runway, therefore the helicopter will not have force feedback effects for ground
bumps or retractable gear thumps. The helicopter WILL feel feedback when flying
forces become extreme, or when the helicopter crashes.
