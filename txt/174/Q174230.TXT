KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Adding duplicate users and global groups from a trusted domain to local groups
may cause excessive memory usage in Lsass.exe.

CAUSE
=====

Lsass.exe fails to deallocate memory properly when an already existing imported
user or group is re-added to one of the local groups. This problem will most
likely occur when using a command-line utility to perform the add function.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, perform one of the following:

 - If the Netlogon service is stopped and restarted, memory usage by Lsass.exe
   returns to normal.

   -or-

 - Install the updated version of Samsrv.dll.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
