TITLE   :WD97: Invalid Links from Link to Remote File Transfer Protocol
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a hyperlink to a remote FTP site (for example,
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com) in a Microsoft Word 97 HTML document and then log on to
the FTP server, the FTP page is loaded with a directory listing, but all the
hyperlinks on the FTP page are invalid. If you click one of these hyperlinks,
Microsoft Word will display the following error message:

   Unable to open <directory or file name>. Cannot locate the Internet
   server or proxy server.

CAUSE
=====

The hyperlinks on the FTP page assume that the base hyperlink is the local cache
directory.

Internet browsers use the base hyperlink to locate links to other files. A base
hyperlink allows you to insert relative links [or partial Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs)] in your document. For example, if the base hyperlink is

   http://example.microsoft.com.

you can insert

   /images/bullet.gif

in your HTML document instead of the full path:

   http://example.microsoft.com/images/bullet.gif


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
