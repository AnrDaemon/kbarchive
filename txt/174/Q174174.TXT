KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you attempt to configure the MS Mail Connector by specifying an
Administrator mailbox on the Interchange tab, and you then specify a message
size limit on the General tab, you will see the following error message when you
click the Apply button:

   You must specify at least one address space on the Address Space property
   page or at least one site on the Connected Sites property page before this
   connector can be created.

This message is incorrect because there is no Connected Sites property page for
the MS Mail Connector.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a standard error message that is displayed for gateway objects.
