TITLE   :Index Server Queries Return Not Enough Storage Is Available Err.
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you do a query using Index Server, the browser may return an error message
similar to the following:

   Not enough storage is available to complete this operation 0x8007000e.

This error message will appear some of the time, but not necessarily all of the
time.

CAUSE
=====

If the query is using a POST command (in the HTML file), you can get the above
error message. The Index Server is expecting all POST commands to be Null
Terminated.

WORKAROUND
==========

Instead of using the POST command, use the GET command in the HTML code, or
ensure that the data in the POST command is Null Terminated.
