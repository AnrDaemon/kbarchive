KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup kbtlckbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Flight Simulator 98 you may receive the following error
message:

   Flight Simulator 98 requires 4096MB for installation.

The megabyte requirement may be different on your computer, but it will always
remain in the 4000MB (4GB) range. Flight Simulator requires only 100MB of free
hard disk space for installation.

CAUSE
=====

This error message may occur if you do not have enough free hard disk space on
the installation drive of your computer. The error message may also occur if
calculation of free hard disk space during the detection portion of Setup is
incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not have enough free hard disk space on the installation drive of your
computer, free up enough space on your hard disk to allow Setup to complete
successfully. (Approximately 100MB as stated in the system requirements.) If you
have verified that you have sufficient hard disk space, download the Flight
Simulator 98 Setup patch from the following Web address:

   http://www.microsoft.com/games/products.asp?filter=fsim

If you have experienced this problem and are not able to successfully Setup
Microsoft Flight Simulator 98, this patch should resolve the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Flight Simulator 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup may incorrectly determine the amount of free disk space on hard disk
drives that contain partitions. Partitions of 2000MB are particularly affected,
though the error message may appear with any partition.

Additional query words: flightsim 4096 partition setup fs98
