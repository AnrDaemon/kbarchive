======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may be unable to locate and connect to some network resources when
multiple network adapters are installed on the computer running Windows 95.

For example, if Dial-Up Networking is used in conjunction with a Local Area
Network (LAN), you may be unable to connect to resources on the LAN while a
Dial-Up Networking connection is active.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows 95 attempts to resolve a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) Domain Name Service (DNS) network name, only one network
adapter is used to send the DNS name queries even though there may be more than
one network adapter installed. Thus, DNS name queries for a resource on one
network may be sent to the wrong network. The result is that the name is not
known and cannot be resolved.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
