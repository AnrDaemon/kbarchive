SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) provides the ability to replicate designated
registry keys as associated with a Generic Service or Generic Application
resource types.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSCS provides the ability for Generic Service and Generic Application resource
types to specify registry keys below HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE that should be
replicated to all nodes in the cluster.

Some services or applications may update registry information while they are
running by use of Win32 registry functions. MSCS provides registry checkpointing
for noncluster aware applications that may use these functions. Registry
checkpointing for these resources occurs under the following conditions:

 - When you specify a new registry key for the resource, the specified key is
   checkpointed.

 - When the resource goes online, the registry keys are updated with the
   previously checkpointed information.

 - When the resource is brought offline, all the checkpoints associcated with
   this resource are saved.

 - When the resource is online and changes are made to the registry key which is
   registered with the cluster server for replication, MSCS ensures that the
   updates are written to a checkpoint maintained on the quorum device.

If you manually update these registry keys while the application or service is
offline, the changes may not be replicated or may be lost. To prevent this from
happening, make any manual changes while the service or application resource is
online.

Cluster aware applications should make use of cluster registry functions as
provided in the cluster API set when working with registry keys under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster. Consult the MSCS Software Development Kit (SDK) for
more information on this topic.
