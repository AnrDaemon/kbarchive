TITLE   :Delayed Worker Threads Causes a STOP 7A
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Delayed worker threads may cause a STOP 7A - KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR message to
be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

When the browser receives a server announcement, the transport notifies the
browser at the interrupt level. This announcement is queued to a worker thread
by allocating a block of non-paged pool for the work item and queuing that work
item for later processing.

If the announcements arrive very quickly or if the computer running the browser
is very busy, the work items are not processed as quickly as they are received.
In that case, all of the non-paged pool memory is consumed by these queue
entries.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
