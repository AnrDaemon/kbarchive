The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer is unable to read or modify
multi-string registry values. If a value is added or changed, only the first
line of the multi-string data value is written.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Installer currently does not have the capability to
read or write complete multi-string registry values.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use an external utility designed for editing multi-string registry values.
Execution of such utilities can be accomplished within Systems Management Server
Installer by using the Execute Program script item.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer 1.0.

This is fixed in the latest publicly available version of Installer available on
the Microsoft Web site at
http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/downloads/install.asp.
