SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a computer running Windows NT Server from a computer running

such as launching Task Manager or Cheyenne ARCserve, the computer running
Windows NT Server crashes with the following error message:

   UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP

CAUSE
=====

Remotely Possible software has some incompatibility with Floating Point
Emulation software. If the system board is using the faulty floating point error
Pentium processor and you have floating point emulation enabled, your system may
trap.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the floating-point emulation by using the Pentnt.exe utility shipped
with Windows NT.
