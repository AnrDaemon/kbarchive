The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTONS
========

After running import during a manual dirsync, the program fails with an error
message that may appear in the Dirsync.log file:

   ERROR [13] Dirsync import error accessing srvtrans.glb

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when import attempts to read the Srvtrans.glb file and the
file is either locked open or corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

 - If the file is locked open, remove the lock and try import again. It may be
   necessary to complete another full dirsync cycle.

 - If the file is larger than zero bytes or corrupted, rename the Srvtrans.glb
   file and create a new one using TYPE NUL > SRVTRANS.GLB and complete
   another dirsync cycle:
