-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

One of the following errors may occur when you use the ExitWindows API function
declaration from the API Text Viewer.

   Run-time error '453':
   Specified DLL function not found

   - or -

   Run-time error '453':
   Can't find DLL entry point ExitWindows in user32

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is an incomplete declare statement in the API Viewer for the ExitWindows()
function.

To use this function correctly, add 'Alias "ExitWindowsEx" ' to the function
declaration so the declare statement is as follows:

      Declare Function ExitWindows Lib "user32" Alias "ExitWindowsEx" (ByVal _
      dwReserved As Long, ByVal uReturnCode As Long) As Long

You can also change the statement in the file win32api.txt so the next time you
use the API Text Viewer, the Declare statement will be correct.

REFERENCES
==========

To learn more about the API Text Viewer, select the "Books on Line" option from
the Help menu, and in the "Find" text box enter the search criterion "api"
(without the quotes.) The first item under the "Visual Basic Books OnLine" node
will be the topic "Accessing the Microsoft Windows API."
