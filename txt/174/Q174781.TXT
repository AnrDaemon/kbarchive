TITLE   :Key Storage File Invalid Msg. When Try to Recover a Certificate

KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install or reinstall a certificate, you will get the following
error message:

   Key storage file is invalid.

CAUSE
=====

When a certificate is installed on Internet Information Server (IIS), both an
.Req (certificate request) file and a number of encrypted registry entries are
created for the key pair.

When you try to replace a certificate by just putting the .Req file back in
place, you will get the above error message. It is necessary to have a backup of
the complete private key and the request file to successfully reinstall the
certificate.

In order to successfully reinstall a certificate, a current and complete back up
of the registry or a full certificate backup from within Key Manager is
required.

WORKAROUND
==========

To back up a certificate from within Key Manager, click Key, select Export File,
then select Backup. This will generate a warning screen and then allow a
complete certificate back up to be made.

NOTE: The warning concerns the possibility that if someone else gets a copy of
the complete certificate, they will be able to "spoof" or mimic the legitimate
site. Appropriate security measures must be taken to ensure that the copy of the
complete certificate is not available to non-authorized users.
