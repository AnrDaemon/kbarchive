TITLE   :Stop 0x0000000A in Atapi.sys (Post SP2) with DMA Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use DMA Bus-Mastering on a PCI IDE controller using Atapi.sys (Service
Pack 2 or later) you may experience the following blue screen error message:

   Stop 0x0000000A (0x00830830, 0x0000000d, 0x00000001 0x800059f0)
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
   Address 800059f0 has base at 80005000 - ATAPI.SYS

NOTE: The first parameter will vary and the fourth parameter will always fall in
the range of Atapi.sys.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused when the buffer provided to Atapi is in user-mode and the driver
not running in the same context, accesses the buffer. This happens specifically
with the inquiry command using pass-through-direct mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable DMA Bus-Mastering for Atapi or contact the manufacture of the
application for an update or rewrite the application to use
IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH.

TITLE : How to Enable IDE DMA Bus-Mastering using SP2 ATAPI.SYS



MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a design problem that has been seen with applications that use the
SCSIOP_INQUIRY commands to the miniport through the
IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT interface. In order to send
IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT you must be an administrator. This IOCTL should
not be used to send a SCSIOP_INQUIRY.
