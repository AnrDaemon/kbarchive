 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you dial into a Windows NT 4.0 Remote Access Service (RAS) server using a
Windows 95 RAS client with the TCP/IP protocol, you are unable to ping any hosts
on the remote network, including the RAS server's IP addresses, and you may
receive the following error message:

   No domain server was available to validate your password. You may not be able
   to gain access to some network resources.

NOTE: This problem does not occur when dialing with a Windows NT 4.0 RAS client.


CAUSE
=====

One or more services have been added or changed on the RAS server without
reapplying the Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3 (SP3).



RESOLUTION
==========

Reapply SP3 to the RAS server.
