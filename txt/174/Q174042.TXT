TITLE   :XADM: Standard Edition should not be Installed on Cluster System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The Microsoft Exchange Server Standard Edition Setup program will allow you to
point to a shared cluster drive on a Windows NT Enterprise Server running
Microsoft Cluster Services. It will only install on the local node, but if the
Server fails over, the information will be pulled to the other node and the
Exchange Server installation will be destroyed.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server Standard Edition is not a cluster aware
application but the Server setup portion does not have the ability to prevent
you from installing the software on the shared cluster drive.

Microsoft will not support any installation of the Exchange Server Standard
Edition on a cluster aware system.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Enterprise Edition of Exchange Server must be installed on the cluster aware
system to take advantage of the Microsoft Cluster Services and prevent possible
data corruption.
