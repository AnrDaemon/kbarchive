SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to access the Navaids for Europe in Microsoft Flight Simulator
98, you receive an hour glass, and then it appears as if your computer has
locked up or hung.

To access Navaids, click Airport/Facility Directory on the World menu, and then
click a location (Europe) on the world map.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The computer does not actually hang when you access the Navaids in Europe, but
accessing them can take from 3-10 minutes total depending on the computer's
speed and performance.

Once you receive the hour glass, wait for it to return to a pointer, and then you
can access the navigational information.
