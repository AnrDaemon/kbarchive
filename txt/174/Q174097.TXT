SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Internet Explorer has built-in security that you can use to control
what types of software Web sites can download and run on your computer. This
article describes how to configure your Internet Explorer security settings to
specify the types of software you can download and run on your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure your Internet Explorer security settings to specify the types of
software that can be downloaded and run on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the MSN icon on the desktop, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Security tab.

3. Click the appropriate check boxes under Active Content to select or clear
   them, and then click OK. The following settings are available in Internet
   Explorer:
    - Allow Downloading of Active Content: This setting specifies whether
      Internet Explorer should automatically download any active content (for
      example, animations and multimedia files) to your computer.

    - Enable ActiveX Controls and Plug-ins: This setting specifies whether
      Internet Explorer should automatically use items that show active content
      (for example, a vertical marquee, or an animation).

    - Run ActiveX Scripts: This setting specifies whether Internet Explorer
      automatically runs ActiveX scripts from Web sites.

    - Enable Java Programs: This setting specifies whether Internet Explorer
      automatically runs Java programs.

4. Click Safety Level to set your security method, and then click OK. The
   following safety levels for active content are available in Internet
   Explorer:
    - High (recommended for all users): This setting specifies that you want to
      be notified about any potential security problems from a Web site. Active
      content that might pose a security problem is not downloaded, and you are
      not able to view it.

    - Medium (recommended for experts and developers): This setting specifies
      that you want to be warned about any potential security problems from a
      Web site. You can then choose whether or not to download or view active
      content.

    - None (not recommended): This setting specifies that you do not want to be
      warned about potential security problems from a Web site. All active
      content is automatically downloaded to your computer. This option is not
      recommended.

5. Click OK to return to Windows.
