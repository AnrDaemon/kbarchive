SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Cluster Server provides the ability to use or ignore specific
networks. This feature may be useful for networks allocated to specific tasks
not affiliated with cluster operations or cluster resource related clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the procedure below to restrict or enable network use:

1. Right-click the cluster name. The name is at the top level of the resource or
   group tree in the left portion of the Cluster Administrator window (above the
   Groups folder).

2. Select Properties.

3. Select the Network Priority tab.

4. Adjust network priority for internal cluster communications as needed with
   the up and down arrows provided.

5. Select the network to enable or disable and click Properties.

6. Select or clear the "Enable for cluster use" check box as desired.

7. When you are finished, click OK.

NOTE: It is important to allow for internal cluster communications as well as
client communications. A typical configuration with two network adapters would
allow all communications on the system's primary network adapter and internal
cluster communications only on the secondary adapter. The secondary adapter
would have the highest priority for cluster communications and would allow the
primary adapter to assume this role if the secondary adapter fails.

Additional query words: cluster network enable ignore MSCS
