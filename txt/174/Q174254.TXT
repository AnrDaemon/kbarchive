TITLE   :XADM: GroupWise Users must Grant Access Rights to be Migrated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

To migrate Novell GroupWise users, the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard
requires that each user grant read and write access rights to Mail/Phone,
Appointments, Notes, Tasks, and select Read Items Marked Private.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If none of these access rights are selected, an error is detected and recorded
in the Windows NT Server Event Viewer Application log. If partial access rights
are granted (for example, read and write access to Mail/Phone and Appointments
are granted, but no rights are granted to Notes and Tasks), the migration
completes without reporting an error accessing Note and Task information. Only
Mail/Phone and Appointment data is migrated.

Due to GroupWise implementation issues, Exchange Server cannot detect and report
on access rights to individual mail types.
