SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Press "Step by Step" and "Running" series books for Microsoft
programs (including Microsoft Office, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access) do
not contain instructions for how to delete or move data files once they are
created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most Microsoft Windows programs focus on the creation and maintenance of various
types of information. They do not allow you to move, delete, or copy the data
files from place to place on your hard drive. To move, delete, or copy the data
files, you will need to use separate file management software.

For example, Microsoft Word can create, modify, and change the names of documents
very easily. However, there are no clear methods of deleting any of the created
files from within Word itself. This behavior is by design to allow all programs
to concentrate on creating and manipulating their information without making
each program responsible for providing file maintenance services.

Windows provides several methods of managing files for all programs. In Windows
95 and Windows NT 4.0, the best file management tool is the Windows Explorer.
(This program should not be confused with Microsoft Internet Explorer, used to
view sites on the Internet.)

Further information on the use of the Windows Explorer can be found in the
Microsoft Press book titled, "Microsoft Windows 95 Step by Step," ISBN 1-
55615-683-9. This book specifically provides steps for deleting files, as well
as a lesson for finding your files.

In Windows 3.1 and Windows NT 3.51 and earlier, the best file management tool is
the File Manager. For more information on the File Manager, please see
"Microsoft Windows 3.1 Step by Step," ISBN 1-55615-501-8.
