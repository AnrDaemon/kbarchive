SUMMARY
=======

When you view Performance Monitor log files in Chart Mode, the Time Window can
be changed. As the Time Window is adjusted, the user may notice different highs
and lows (peaks and valleys) for counters graphed on the chart. Also, notice
that values for Last, Average, Min, Max, and Graph Time will also adjust as the
Time Window is changed by the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 Resource Kit documents this behavior as
normal for Performance Monitor in Chapter 10, page 327. Performance Monitor only
takes 100 data points out of a log file and presents them in Chart View. To see
more than 100 data points from a log file, you can export the data and create a
chart using another application such as Microsoft Excel.
