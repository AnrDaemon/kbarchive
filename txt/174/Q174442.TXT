TITLE   :All Users Have the Same Screen Saver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using user profiles in Windows 95, all users on a Windows 95-based
computer may have the same screen saver.

CAUSE
=====

The screen saver is called from the System.ini file. This file is global to all
users on the same Windows 95-based computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using the System.ini file to store the screen saver choice is by design to
remain compatible with older third-party screen saver programs. If separate
screen savers are required, you may want to consider using Microsoft Windows NT.
In Windows NT, all screen saver information is saved in the registry, and is
unique to each user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the screen saver is called from the System.ini file, individual
settings for the screen saver are stored in the registry. Each user can control
how the screen saver works during his or her logon session.
