TITLE   :XCLN: Item Selection Does Not Work as Expected with SHIFT Key
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:Windows:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open the Recover Deleted Items From window in Microsoft Outlook or
Microsoft Exchange, the first item in the list is highlighted but not selected.
Thinking that the item is selected, you may try to SHIFT+click other items in
the list to select them.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select the first item and then use the SHIFT key to click on another item in the
list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you choose Recover Deleted Items under the Tools menu while the Deleted Items
folder or a public folder is selected, the Recover Deleted Items From window is
displayed. If you hold the SHIFT key down and select any item in the list other
than the first item, all items between the first item and the item selected are
not selected. Instead, only the item you clicked is selected.
