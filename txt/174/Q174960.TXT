SYMPTOMS

When Rservice is used to start a service on a target computer, it references the
[Startup Parameters] section of the Rservice.ini file, if it has been defined.
The parameters defined in this section are not passed to the service correctly
when it is started.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can use the Server Manager utility to start the service after it is
installed. The startup parameters can be defined prior to starting the service.
