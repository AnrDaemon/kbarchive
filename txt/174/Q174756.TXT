SUMMARY
=======

When a mix of Standard and Enterprise versions of Microsoft Exchange Server are
installed in the same Microsoft Exchange Site, the X.400 Connector is enabled
for all Servers in the Site. This happens regardless of the order in which
Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition Exchange Servers are installed. This is
by product design.
