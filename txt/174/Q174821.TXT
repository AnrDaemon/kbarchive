TITLE   :XADM: TCP/IP Error Messages Following Install and Reboot
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, the following errors may appear
in the Application log following each reboot:

   ID 11502
   MSExchangeNNTP
   Error
   Initialization of the NNTP external interface failed with error -
   2147467259.

   ID 11303
   MSExchangeNNTP
   Error
   An error occurred while binding NNTP to SSL in the GetHostName function.

   ID 11504
   MSExchange Pop3
   Error
   Initialization of the POP3 external interface failed with error -
   2147467259.

These errors will continue to appear, even if a clean install has been performed.

CAUSE
=====

If TCP/IP has been loaded on to the server and then removed, the above errors
will occur whenever Exchange Server 5.0 is loaded on to that server and then
rebooted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reload TCP/IP on the server and the errors will no longer appear in the
Application log.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NNTP and POP3 are native to TCP/IP. Therefore, they are trying to call/perform
Winsock32 functions. Because Winsock is not present (because TCP/IP was
uninstalled) these errors occur.
