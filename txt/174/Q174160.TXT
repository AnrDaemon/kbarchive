TITLE   :Redirecting Files in Batch Files Inserts Incorrect Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When running a batch file that redirects the output of one file to another file,
Windows NT inserts the number 1 in the filename of the input file. Redirection
in a batch file is done with the greater than (>) character and can be used
alone or with the Type or Print commands.


RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, there is no workaround. Although it will display incorrectly inserted
characters, the command will work correctly. If the file that is being
redirected exists, the file will be redirected to the correct file name without
any problems.

This issue will only cause problems if the file is being referenced by later
commands that are written to correspond to the display of the results of the
redirection line in the batch file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
