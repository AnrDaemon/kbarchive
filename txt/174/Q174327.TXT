SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running Windows NT version 4.0 with Service Pack 3 installed may
display the following pop-up dialog box from certain applications after the
applications have been running for some time:

   DLL Initialization Failed
   Initialization of the dynamic link library crypt32.dll failed.
   The process is terminating abnormally.

RESOLUTION

Apply the updated version of Crypt32.dll to correct the problem. If the problem
occurs as soon as an application is started or after the update has been
applied, verify that all DLLs required by the application are in the system
path.

STATUS

Pack 3. A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression tested and
