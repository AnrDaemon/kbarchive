Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is added by default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Components, and select the Internet Transfer
   Control 5.0(SP2) into the project if it is not already loaded.

3. Place an Internet Transfer Control 5.0(SP2) on Form1 and add the following
   code:

         Private Sub Inet1_StateChanged(ByVal State As Integer)
          Const lCHUNKSIZE As Long = 1024
          Dim vtData As Variant ' Data variable.

          Select Case State
          ' ... Other cases not shown.
          Case icError ' 11
              ' In case of error, return ResponseCode and

         ' ResponseInfo.
              vtData = Inet1.ResponseCode & ":" & _
              Inet1.ResponseInfo

          Case icResponseCompleted  ' 12
              Dim strData As String: strData = ""
              Dim bDone As Boolean: bDone = False

              ' Get first chunk.
              vtData = Inet1.GetChunk(lCHUNKSIZE, icString)
              DoEvents

              Do While Not bDone

                  strData = strData & vtData
                  ' Get next chunk.
                  vtData = Inet1.GetChunk(lCHUNKSIZE, icString)
                  DoEvents

                  If Len(vtData) = 0 Then
                      bDone = True
                  End If
              Loop

             MsgBox strData
          End Select
         End Sub

4. Place a CommandButton (Command1) on Form1 and add the following code:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             Inet1.UserName = "Username"
             Inet1.Password = "Password"
             Inet1.URL = "ftp://YourFTPServer"
             Inet1.Execute , "DIR"
        End Sub

5. From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT, R, S), or press the F5 key to run the
   program. Press the Command1 button and you will see error described above.
