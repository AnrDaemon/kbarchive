SYMPTOMS

HTML keywords are characterized by an extra dollar sign in the syntax (such as
$$History: $). Using these HTML keywords in a non-HTML document may remove text
after the first instance of a greater than ">" character. If no ">"
character exists in the document, nothing happens.

For references to more information about keywords, please see the REFERENCES
section below.
