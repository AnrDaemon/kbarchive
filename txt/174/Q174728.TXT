TITLE   :XADM: Err Msg: Error Occurred While Processing E-mail Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to create a new
mailbox, the following error message may appear:

   An error occurred while processing an e-mail address.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur when a newer version of an Exchange Server computer has
been added to the site but is still unavailable. It is possible that the version
numbers stored in the directory have been replicated, but the address proxy DLLs
themselves have not yet been replicated.

When a mailbox is added, the version number for the proxy DLLs is obtained from
the directory. If the newest version of the proxy DLLs is not available on this
server, an attempt is made to locate a server in the site with the newest
version of the proxy DLLs. When the server with the correct version of the DLLs
is not up and running, cannot be reached, does not have the appropriate shares,
or the user running the Administrator program does not have access to the
Address share, this error occurs.
