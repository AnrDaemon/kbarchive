SUMMARY
=======

QuickTime provides a feature which enables you to zoom in and out when viewing a
360 degree view. The zoom feature is available from within Bookshelf 98 for
Macintosh but not in Bookshelf 98 for Windows.

The following article tells you how to add this functionality in Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add the zoom feature on the Windows platform, use these instructions:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to QuickTime for Windows (32-bit), then
   click Movie Player 32-bit.

2. Click the File menu, then click Open.

3. Navigate to the D:\books\mm folder (where D is the drive letter of your CD
   ROM drive).

4. Click one of the files listed here (for example, 78bd6.mov), then click Open.

The QuickTime Movie Player will open the 360 degree movie, and you will be able
to zoom in or out by following the steps below:

Zoom In
-------

1. Place mouse cursor inside the 360 degree movie window.

2. Windows: Hold down the SHIFT key on the keyboard.

   Macintosh: Hold down the mouse button and press the Option key on the
   keyboard.

Zoom Out
--------

1. Place mouse cursor inside the 360 degree movie window.

2. Windows: Hold down the Control (CTRL) key on the keyboard.

   Macintosh: Hold down the mouse button and press the Control key on the
   keyboard.

NOTE: For a program to take advantage of this feature, the development team must
make certain programming calls to the QuickTime technology files. The Bookshelf
98 for Windows team did not include these calls in the final product.
QuickTime is manufactured by Apple Computer Corporation, a vendor independent of
