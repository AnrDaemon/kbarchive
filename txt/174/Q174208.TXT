TITLE   :XWEB: Netscape Macintosh Client Does not Show Folders Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you are running Netscape Communicator, version 4.03 for the Macintosh against
a Microsoft Exchange Server using Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), you may
find that server folders are not displayed in the drop down menu. The Message
Center will show the folders, however.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Netscape Messenger performs an IMAP list "" "%" in versions 4.02 and later.
Netscape issues this command against the Exchange Server but fails to show the
server folders immediately. Only until after the Message Center is selected will
the server folders then be shown.
