TITLE   :ODE97: Setup Wizard Disk Images Do Not Contain Long File Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup wizard
to create disk images for your custom application, all file names that are added
to the Add Files list are copied to the disk images using the MS-DOS naming
convention. Therefore, if you add files that contain long file names to the Add
Files list, the file names are truncated on the disk images.

RESOLUTION
==========

When the custom setup program is installed on a computer that conforms to the
long file names naming convention, the file names are expanded to what they
originally were.

There is no option in the Setup Wizard program that enables you to copy the long
file names in the Add Files list box to the disk images.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start the ODE Setup Wizard.

2. On the Add File screen, add several files that have long file names.

3. Continue through the Setup wizard program until you have added all the
   necessary options.

4. Let the ODE Setup Wizard program create your disk images.

5. After the disk images are created, open the images folder in Windows
   Explorer.

   Note that the long file names have been truncated.
