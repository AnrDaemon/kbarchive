SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Print button on the toolbar of the Exchange client to print
to a Lexmark Optra E printer that is connected to a local LPT port, the output
may be garbled. This problem can also manifest itself when printing
multiple-page documents; the second or following pages print as garbage. This
can happen whether the message is open or not.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the default settings in the properties of the Lexmark
Printer.

RESOLUTION

the message.

According to Lexmark Technical Support, the following changes need to be made to
the settings of the Lexmark Printer:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Printers.

2. Right-click the printer, and then click Properties.

3. Under Details, in Spooling Settings, select EMF.
