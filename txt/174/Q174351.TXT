======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines the steps to create a secondary SMTP address space so
Exchange Server mailboxes can receive mail addressed to multiple domains.
Outside users can send mail to more than the default domain. For example, the
same Exchange Server mailbox can receive mail addressed as username@company.com
and as username@domain2.com.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before proceeding with the Exchange Server configuration, add a new MX record to
reflect the additional domain name. This new MX record should be added in the
Domain Name Service (DNS) provider, which might be part of the Internet Service
Provider (ISP).

For additional information and the syntax of the MX record, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q153001 : XFOR: DNS MX Records and CNAMEs

The correct addition of this MX record can be verified by performing a Name
Service Lookup, using the new domain name.

To configure the Exchange Server computer, complete the following steps.

NOTE: If you are configuring an Exchange Server 4.0 computer, skip step 1 and
continue to step 2.

1. Open the properties for the Internet Mail Service from the Exchange Server
   Administrator program. On the Routing tab, if the Internet Mail Service is
   configured to reroute SMTP, click Add, enter the secondary Domain, and
   specify as Incoming.

   For example, if your domain name is company.com and you wish to add a second
   domain name of domain2.com, you need to click the Reroute SMTP mail (required
   for POP3 support) radio button on the Routing tab. These two entries will
   then be in the routing table:

   company.com <Inbound>

   domain2.com <Inbound>

2. Add the secondary SMTP address space for all users on the list. This can be
   done individually by going to the properties of each mailbox. In the Exchange
   Server Administrator program under Organization\Site\Recipients, select a
   mailbox and double-click to open the Properties page. Click the Email Address
   tab, click New, select Internet Address, and then click OK. Enter the
   username@domain2.com as the e-mail address. For additional information about
   bulk modifications, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

3. Restart the Internet Mail Service by double-clicking the Services icon in
   Control Panel.
