======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Running the GetChunk example code from the Visual Basic 5.0 Help file generates
a run-time error:

   '35764' - still executing last request.

Instead of intercepting icResponseReceived notification in the StateChanged event
as shown in the Help file for Internet Transfer Control GetChunk method, the
correct code should intercept icResponseCompleted notification.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example shows the correct way to use Transfer Control GetChunk
method.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 5.0. If you are already running Visual Basic, choose New
   Project on the File menu. Create a Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a CommandButton, Command1, to Form1.

3. Add an Internet Transfer Control, Inet1, to Form1.

4. Add the following code to the Code window:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             Inet1.Execute "http://www.microsoft.com", "GET"
             'download the start page of microsoft.com
         End Sub

         Private Sub Inet1_StateChanged(ByVal State As Integer)
            ' Retrieve server response using the GetChunk
            ' method when State = 12. This example assumes the
            ' data is text.

            Select Case State
            ' ... Other cases not shown.

            Case icResponseCompleted ' 12
               Dim vtData As Variant ' Data variable.
               Dim strData As String: strData = ""
               Dim bDone As Boolean: bDone = False

               ' Get first chunk.
               vtData = Inet1.GetChunk(1024, icString)

               Do While Not bDone

                  strData = strData & vtData
                  ' Get next chunk.
                  vtData = Inet1.GetChunk(1024, icString)
                  If Len(vtData) = 0 Then
                     bDone = True
                  End If
               Loop

               MsgBox strData
            End Select

         End Sub
