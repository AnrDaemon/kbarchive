MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been seen using the following compressed files from the Web
site:

   Eximwiz.exe
   Adminnt.exe
   Admin95.exe
   Rkintel.exe
   Rkwin95.exe

Eximwiz.exe converts Microsoft Exchange bulk export format (.csv) files to
Microsoft Mail import format. After creating the output file, you can use the
tool to interactively import addresses into a Microsoft Mail postoffice on the
network, or you can send e-mail with the import file to external recipients. In
addition, new functionality allows you to export from Microsoft Mail and create
a .csv file to add Microsoft Mail recipients as Microsoft Exchange custom
recipients.

Eximwiz is useful when directory synchronization between a Microsoft Exchange
Server implementation and Microsoft Mail is not a viable option (if, for
example, you are trying to populate a trading partner's Microsoft Mail system
with relevant addresses, such as purchasing agents, from your global address
list). Eximwiz can also be used to manually perform directory synchronization
between a Microsoft Exchange Server computer and a foreign mail switch that does
not support the Microsoft Mail Dirsync protocol.
