TITLE   :XWEB: Outlook Web Access Client Fails if JavaScript Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


When you attempt to open a Microsoft Exchange Mailbox using Outlook Web Access
(OWA), the mailbox may appear frozen or hung without displaying any error
messages. The mailbox itself is viewable, but no functions can be performed.

CAUSE
=====

JavaScript may be disabled in your Internet browser. This will allow the mailbox
to be opened, but because the functions are dependent upon JavaScript, nothing
can be done. The Microsoft Exchange Server knows nothing about the client
configuration so there are no error messages displayed to warn the user that no
functionality is available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable JavaScript in the browser and reopen the mailbox or refresh the browser.
This will allow the changes to take effect and the client will function
properly.
