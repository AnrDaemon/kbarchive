KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server 1.2 Remote Control feature offers better
performance for client computers running Windows NT 3.51 than for client
computers running Windows NT 4.0. For Windows NT 3.51, Systems Management Server
offers a client-side accelerated video driver for improved screen transfer.
Changes made in Windows NT 4.0, which was released after Systems Management
Server 1.2, prevented this enhanced video driver from being available to clients
running Windows NT 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
