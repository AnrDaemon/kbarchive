TITLE   :Extra Page Printed on Epson Stylus Color Printers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When printing in color mode to an Epson Stylus printer (Color, Pro, Pro XL, Pro
XL+) from a computer running Windows NT 4.0, extra lines of different color may
be present in the output and cause the extra data to be printed on a second
page. These extra lines will print on the second page after the 3 mm top margin
if the maximum printable area is used in the application.

CAUSE
=====

With banding printers, there are normally extra lines in the last band that
should not be sent, usually because they are blank. However, if the application
sends data outside the "imageable" area, these extra lines are printed.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
