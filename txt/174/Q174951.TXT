TITLE   :Err Msg: Error Copying File Cannot Copy Config Access Is Denied
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:1.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the Zero Administration Kit for Windows 95, you may
receive one or more of the following error messages:

    - Error Copying File
   Cannot copy config: Access is denied
   Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is
   not currently in use.

 - A failure occurred while copying Zero Administration Kit for Windows 95
   components from the CD to the location you specified. Please check that
   you have enough disk space prior to running Setup again.

 - Error Copying File
   Cannot copy config: cannot create or replace. File does not exist.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - The account that is logged on and is installing the Zero Administration Kit
   for Windows 95, has insufficient permissions to the NETLOGON share or the
   network share location for policy files that you specified during setup.

 - You do not have "full" access to the NETLOGON share folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add the account or group (with at least change
permissions) to the NETLOGON share or the network share specified during
installation. For example, if the domain controller computer name is ALPHA, the
network share location would be \\ALPHA\NETLOGON. On ALPHA, the default NETLOGON
share would be located at:

   %systemroot%\system32\repl\import\scripts.

Add the appropriate permissions needed for the user or group installing Zero
Administration Kit for Windows 95.

NOTE: You can use this method, or you can set the NETLOGON share to "full"
access.
