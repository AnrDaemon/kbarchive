SUMMARY
=======

The MSCS Time Service resource coordinates the synchronization of the date and
time on cluster nodes. The time between nodes is synchronized automatically when
the cluster is formed and at specified intervals thereafter. If you change the
time in the cluster, you may want to synchronize the time on cluster nodes
quickly rather than waiting for the next synchronization interval to occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the time and force time synchronization, perform the following steps:

1. Change the time on the node that currently owns the Time Service resource.

   NOTE: This will be the node that owns the Cluster Group.

2. On the other node, run the NET TIME command and specify the computer name of
   the node that owns the Time Service.

   For example, if NODEA owns the time service, type the following at the Windows
   NT command prompt and then press ENTER:

   NET TIME /set /y \\NODEA

NOTE: If you change the time on a node that does not own the Time Service, that
node will eventually synchronize with the owner of the Time Service and may not
reflect the time adjustment. For best results, follow the above procedure.
