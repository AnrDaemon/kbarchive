PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running ESEUTIL /g on the directory store or information store, the
following error may occur:

   - 1022 indicating disk I/O error

This occurs when InocuLAN anti-virus software is installed on a computer running
Windows NT Server 4.0 with Service Pack 3 and running Exchange 5.5. InocuLAN
installs a file system filter that disables the JET engine ESE97 from addressing
database files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform the following to work around this problem:

 - Uninstall InocuLAN and restart your computer.

   NOTE: Disabling InocuLAN does not resolve this problem.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Install the Windows NT hotfix that been released as part of the roll-up hotfixes
that are recommended in the Readme.doc file for Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5. For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix
has been posted to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft
