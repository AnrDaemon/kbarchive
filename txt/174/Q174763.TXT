PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the properties of a public folder, the "Propagate these properties
to all subfolders" option on the General tab may not appear if the public folder
does not have any subfolders.

WORKAROUND
==========

To make this option available, create a subfolder for the public folder in a
Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For Exchange Server administrators who access public folders that do not have
subfolders, this option can be overlooked when planning a public folder
installation, or when disaster recovery requires the propagating of the
permissions to all subfolders.
