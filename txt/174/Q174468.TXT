TITLE   :SLI_SEND Fails To Complete, Causing Win32 SLI App To Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Win32 SLI application may hang waiting for an SLI_SEND to complete. This may
occur if the host has sent an UNBIND on the session, which causes the SLI
library to issue an RUI_TERM.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server's Winsli32.dll does not return the SLI_SEND Post response to the SLI
application after an RUI_TERM is sent and this causes the application to hang.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated Winsli32.dll so that it returns all outstanding SLI verbs
to the application when a session fails.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and
3.0sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
