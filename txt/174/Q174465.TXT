TITLE   :Bad SAP Packet Causes Stop 0x0000000A in Afd.sys
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running Windows NT will blue screen with a Stop 0x0000000A shortly
after the Logon Screen appears or if the computer was removed from the network
during startup, it will blue screen approximately 10 seconds after being put
back on the network.

Stop screen:

   Stop 0x0000000A (0xFFB94000, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0xFF5A98C5)

The blue screen will show Afd.sys, Nwlnkipx.sys, and Ntoskrnl.exe on the stack.

The first and last BugCheck parameters will vary.

This will be most evident if there are many computers running the SAP Agent.

CAUSE
=====

A faulty network interface card (NIC) is broadcasting bad SAP packets on the
network with a large value for Bytes Remaining. The computer has to have SAP
Agent loaded for this to occur. It does not matter if the computer is using the
Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) or intraNetWare client redirector but must
have either redirector loaded. The SAP Agent is allowing the packet to be passed
up the stack.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the computer running Windows NT from the
network to start it up and then disable SAP Agent. After this service is
disabled, the computer can then be put back on the network. The resource
broadcasting the bad SAP packet must then be found and removed from the network.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 6.
