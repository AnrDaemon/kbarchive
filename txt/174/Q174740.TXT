TITLE   :XFOR: Error When Migrating Version 6 cc:Mail Post Office
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Exchange cc:Mail Migration Wizard to migrate a
Version 6 (DB8) cc:Mail post office, the following error message may appear:

   cc: Mail Utility Error
   Incorrect version of Export/Import.exe
   cc: Mail Export.exe, Import.exe and IE.RI version 8.00 to 8.X must be
   in the search path for executables files.

When you view the cc:Mail connector properties, on the General tab, in
Import/Export version, the only versions listed are:

   Import 5.15/Export 5.14
   Import 6.0/Export 6.0

CAUSE
=====

The migration of cc:Mail post offices version 6 or later (DB8) requires version
8 of Import/Export.exe and IE.RI. The migration of cc:Mail post offices version
5 or earlier (DB6) requires Import/Export.exe version 5.x.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy version 8.x of Import.exe/Export.exe and IE.RI files to the
<Drive>:\Exchsrvr\Bin subdirectory. Ensure these files are not located in
the Winnt subdirectory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Migration Wizard is started and cc:Mail migration is selected, it will
check the current directory \exchsrvr\bin before going to the search path to
find the Import/Export files. Currently, the following Import/Export versions
are supported for the Exchange cc:Mail connector:

   cc:Mail PO's ver. 6 (DB8): Import/Export and IE.RI version 6
   cc:Mail PO's ver. 5 (DB6): Import 5.15/Export 5.14
