KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbpatch kbBug kbfix kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you use Innoculan anti-virus software on a Windows NT Server version 4.0
Service Pack 3 (SP3) computer running Microsoft Exchange Server, the Exchange
Directory (DS) service will not start. In the Windows NT Event Viewer
Application log, you will see the following error:

   Unexpected NT API error: 0xC000000D
   MSExchange DS ((153) ) - 1022
   Error -1022 has occurred (internal ID 2030149). Contact Microsoft
   Technical Support for assistance.
   The Microsoft Exchange Server database (EDB) could not be initialized
   and returned error -1022. Unrecoverable error, the directory can't
   continue.

This is because Innoculan installs a file system filter that disables the JET
engine ESE97, from addressing database files.

WORKAROUND
==========

One of the two following workarounds may be used if Innoculan is installed on
the Exchange Server.

1. Uninstall Innoculan and restart the computer. Disabling the Innoculan service
   is not sufficient.

2. Install a Windows NT hotfix that been released to customers as part of the
   roll-up hotfixes that are recommended in the readme.doc file for Microsoft
   Exchange Server, version 5.5. These hotfixes are available at:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up/

   Note: If you later re-install Windows NT Service Packs, you must also
   re-install the hotfixes regardless of your responses to the Overwrite Newer
   Files prompts during the Service Pack installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This same error has occured with Norton NT Tools version 1.0 installed.
Disabling the Norton service does not work, it must be removed.

Omtool Fax Senior 2.5 will produce this error with an internal ID of 2030148. The
hotfix noted above also corrects this problem.
