SYMPTOMS
========


The Mailbox Cleanup Agent deletes messages that have a blank Received Time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mailbox Cleanup Agent is a server-based Exchange Utility in the "Microsoft
BackOffice Resource Kit" and the "Microsoft Exchange Resource Kit" that can be
used to delete older e-mail messages. It uses the MAPI property
PR_MESSAGE_DELIVERY_TIME or "Received Time" to determine whether a message meets
the criteria for deletion. Messages that do not contain this property or have an
invalid value for this property are deleted.

Note that Microsoft Exchange Client and Microsoft Outlook assign a blank Received
Time to mail messages in the Sent Items folder that are composed while you are
working offline.

STATUS
======

This has been fixed in Mailbox Cleanup Agent, Mbclean.exe, version 1.8. It has
been updated so that messages which have a blank or invalid Received Time are
not deleted. The latest versions of the "Microsoft Exchange Resource Kit"
Utilities can be downloaded from the following Microsoft Web site:
