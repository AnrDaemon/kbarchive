SUMMARY
=======

Some cluster configurations may use BusLogic SCSI host adapters. It is important
with any cluster configuration to ensure proper settings on each adapter
attached to the shared SCSI bus. Administrators may find the need to use the
adapter's firmware setup utility to configure specific options.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some BusLogic controllers provide the ability to access the firmware setup by
pressing the CTRL+B key sequence immediately following the adapter's
initialization banner.

After activating the firmware setup program, there are several different
configuration menus to choose from. To configure the adapter for use with a
shared SCSI bus, use the Advanced configuration menu to disable SCSI BUS RESETS.
This prevents the adapter from issuing a reset command to the shared bus while
the other controller on the shared bus may be working with devices.
Additionally, because the shared SCSI bus is not used to start the operating
system, consider setting the controller BIOS to disabled.

Use the Adapter configuration menu to specify the SCSI ID for the host adapter.
On the shared SCSI bus, one adapter will typically use ID 6 and the other ID 7.
It is very important not to allow both adapters to use the same ID.
Additionally, if your system provides termination through the cabling or
external terminators, make sure to disable the termination feature on the
adapter so as to avoid double termination.

Additional information about these options and proper configuration for your
hardware may be supplied by the vendor. For best results, consult with your
hardware vendor for additional details pertaining to your hardware.
