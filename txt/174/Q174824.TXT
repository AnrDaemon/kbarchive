you may receive an error message similar to the following:

   The item's properties could not be displayed. No additional send options
   are available for this message.

CAUSE
=====

The Send Options feature is a function of the Microsoft Exchange Server
information service that is loaded on the client. This feature is not available
when the MS Mail information service is the only information service in the
profile. Therefore, if you are running the Exchange Client in an MS Mail only
environment, this feature will be unavailable to you.
