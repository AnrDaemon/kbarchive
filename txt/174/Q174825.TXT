SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Image property of a PictureBox control repeatedly diminishes GDI and
System resources on Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the BitBlt API function to provide the same functionality as the Image
property. The following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base provides
information about using the BitBlt API function:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following shows you how to create a sample project that demonstrates this
bug. The instructions assume that you have the System Resource Meter running so
you can see the effect of accessing the Image property. The System Resource
Meter is a system tool usually installed in the Accessories program group if you
select the System Resource Meter option when you install Windows 95 or Windows
98.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a PictureBox, Command Button, and Label control to Form1.

3. Set the Picture property of the PictureBox control to an appropriate bitmap
   file.

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit
         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim I as Integer
            For I = 1 to 100
               Picture1.Picture = Picture1.Image
               Label1.Caption = Trim(Str(I))
               DoEvents
            Next I
         End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the program. Minimize the Visual Basic IDE so you can
   see both Form1 and the System Resource meter running. Click Command1 and note
   that the GDI and System Resources diminish by about 20 percent with the click
   of the CommandButton.
