TITLE   :"Print Screen" from MS-DOS Application May Print Twice
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "Print Screen" (PrintScrn) key to print the contents of an
MS-DOS application running on Windows NT 4.0, two copies of the screen contents
may appear in the printer output.

This problem typically occurs only on very fast computers, such as an Intel-
based computer with a P200 processor, and only if the MS-DOS application Program
Information File (PIF) setters are set to pass the print-screen event to the
MS-DOS application.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Virtual DOS Machine (Ntvdm.exe) incorrectly initiates another
print-screen event during the key-up event when you release the PrintScrn key,
even though it should only initiate a print-screen event during the key-down
event.

While Windows NT processes a print-screen event, it cannot accept and queue up
another print-screen event for later processing. Therefore, on slower computers
the second print-screen event caused by the key-up event is initiated but never
accepted by Windows NT because Windows NT is still busy processing the first
print-screen event. However, on faster computers, Windows NT may have completed
the first print-screen event by the time the key-up event initiates another
print-screen event, resulting in two copies of the screen in the output.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Virtual DOS Machine (Ntvdm.exe) has been modified to pass a single
print-screen event when the PrintScrn key is pressed.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
