TITLE   :WD97: Nonbreaking Space Missing Using French Language
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you use any of the French international keyboard
settings, or set the text language of your document to French, a nonbreaking
space may not be added automatically before the following characters:

 - Colon (:)

 - Exclamation Point (!)

 - Question Mark (?)

 - Semicolon (;)

This behavior also occurs with the following French keyboard and language
settings:

 - French (Belgian)

 - French (Canadian)

 - French (Luxembourg)

 - French (Standard)

 - French (Swiss)

CAUSE
=====

The "Replace as you type: 'Straight quotes' with 'smart quotes'" option is
turned off.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, turn on the "'Straight quotes' with 'smart quotes'"
option. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect.

2. Click the "AutoFormat as you type" tab.

3. Under Replace As You Type, click to select the "'Straight quotes' with 'smart
   quotes'" check box, and then click OK.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. When the "'Straight quotes' with 'smart quotes'"
option is turned off, the non-breaking space requirement for certain characters
in the French language is also turned off.

MORE INFORMATION
================

French typography requires a non-breaking space before certain characters of the
French language. Word 97 has added functionality to provide for this
requirement.

To set the language for the text of your document, select the text that you want
to format with a language. To apply the language, point to Language on the Tools
menu and click Set Language.
