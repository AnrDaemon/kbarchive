TITLE   :FIX: "Invalid DOS Path" to SSADMIN.INI on Unix
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbSSafe500bug kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a UNIX and a Windows version of SourceSafe accessing the same
database, launching the SourceSafe Admin program on UNIX invokes the following
error:

   Invalid DOS path <path>\SSADMIN.INI

CAUSE
=====

The UNIX operating system is case sensitive to filenames and the UNIX version of
SourceSafe requires that ssadmin.ini be lower-case. However, when exiting the
Windows version of the SourceSafe Admin, it writes the filename in upper-case.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install Visual Studio Service Pack 3 for Visual SourceSafe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.
