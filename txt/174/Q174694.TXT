SYMPTOMS
========

During initial set up of the LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector (also referred to
as the Exchange PROFS Connector), the connector appears to BIND properly to the
Remote Spooling Communications Subsystem (RSCS) application, but no mail is
exchanged. The last line in the LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector logs for the
LME-PROFS-NJE process is:

   1997/10/01 12:02:07- LME-PROFS-NJE(01b7) 2 23353:SNA connection to the
      host has been established
   << NJESNA(3402)
   1997/10/01 12:02:07- LME-PROFS-NJE(01b7) 4 23224:NJE Connection opened

   1997/10/01 12:02:07- LME-PROFS-NJE(01b7) 4 23230:Waiting for initial
      contact (FMH-4) from NJE partner application

   << njeconn(831)
   1997/10/01 12:02:08- LME-PROFS-NJE(01b7) 4 23205:FMH4: signon supported
   << njeconn(837)

      from host
   << njeconn(1119)

After five minutes the following errors are logged:

   1997/10/01 12:07:08- LME-PROFS-NJE(01b7) 1 23356:Timeout occurred when
      waiting for an LUA verb to complete
   << NJESNA(631)
   1997/10/01 12:07:08- LME-PROFS-NJE(01b7) 1 23349:Error {Session timeout
      occurred} occurred when reading SNA data from the host
   << NJESNA(3599)
   1997/10/01 12:07:08- LME-PROFS-NJE(01b7) 1 23217:Error occurred when
      waiting for the signon record from the host
   << njeconn(1126)
   1997/10/01 12:07:08- LME-PROFS-NJE(01b7) 1 00510:Error {Session timeout
      occurred}: The application failed to initialize.
   << stdmain(858)

CAUSE
=====

The connector and RSCS are supposed to exchange a node signon, and the
initiating partner is the one with the alphabetically higher node name. The logs
above indicate that neither side is initiating the node signon because the
LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector is not configured properly. The LOCALNODE=
parameter in the Linkage.ini file located in C:\Linkage has to match the LINKID
parameter in the RSCS LINK or the LINKDEF statement in the RSCS configuration
file, and the PARTNERNODE= parameter has to match the RSCS node ID.

If the RSCS node ID is alphabetically lower than the LINKID name for the
connector, then RSCS does not initiate the node signon. And if the LinkAge
Exchange-OV/VM Connector is configured so that its LOCALNODE= parameter is
alphabetically lower than the PARTNERNODE= parameter, the connector will not
initiate either, and you will see the above logged errors as a result.

RESOLUTION
==========

Correct the LOCALNODE= and PARTNERNODE= parameters to match the values specified
in the RSCS configuration file. The LOCALNODE= parameter should match the LINKID
parameter in the RSCS LINK or LINKDEF statement, and the PARTNERNODE= parameter
should match the LOCALID parameter (both definitions are located in the RSCS
configuration file).
