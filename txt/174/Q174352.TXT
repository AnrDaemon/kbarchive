======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting the Web Access components, it is sometimes helpful to
receive a more detailed error message from the server. For example, the error
message, "Failed to get Inbox," does not help you understand why you failed to
get the Inbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adding the following registry entry to the Exchange Server computer will return
a more detailed error to the browser.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Find the following registry key

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWEB
   \Parameters

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value. In the Value Name box, enter "Debug".

4. Set the Data Type to DWORD and click OK.

5. In the Data box, enter "1". Click the Hex radio button, and click OK.

This will enable the Exchange Server computer to return a more detailed error
message to the browser such as:

   Failed to get Inbox
   The information store could not be opened. [MAPI 1.0 -
   [MAPI_E_LOGON_FAILED(80040111)]]
   /exchange/USA/LogonFrm.asp

You can then research the MAPI error indicated by the error number returned in
the error message, in this example, 80040111:

   Constant: MAPI_E_LOGON_FAILED
   Description: This error code results when the EMS server refuses to
   let a MAPI client log on.
