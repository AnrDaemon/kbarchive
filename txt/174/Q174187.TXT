PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbWinNT400sp4fix kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 or 3 on a computer with an IBM
PS/2 TrackPoint mouse driver, the Mouse Control Panel utility states the system
is using the Microsoft PS/2 Port Mouse driver. Re-installing the TrackPoint
driver does not resolve the problem.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Plug and Play support in Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 2 and 3 incorrectly configures the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
