TITLE   :PRB: APPEND PROCEDURES Causes "Feature Not Available" in Runtime
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b; WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbHWMAC kbvfp kbvfp300 kbvfp300b kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

"Feature is not available" error occurs when issuing an APPEND PROCEDURES
command in a FoxPro executable.

CAUSE
=====

The COMPILE feature is not available in a distributed application. The APPEND
PROCEDURES command performs an implicit COMPILE of the database when stored
procedures are added.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error message occurs because Visual FoxPro attempts to recompile the
database code when the APPEND PROCEDURES command is issued. Visual FoxPro cannot
perform this action in the runtime environment.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a database using the following command:

         CREATE DATA mytestdata

2. Create a procedure file with the command MODIFY COMMAND myprocs and add the
   following lines of code:

         PROCEDURE myproc
         ENDPROC

3. Create a project with the following MAIN program code:

         OPEN DATA mytestdata
         APPEND PROCEDURES FROM myprocs.prg

4. Build an executable, quit Visual FoxPro, and run the executable.

The "Feature is not available" error will occur on the APPEND PROCEDURES command.
