TITLE   :XFOR: Multiple Messages Are Sent When All Mail Is Forwarded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When a user configures the Internet Mail Service to forward all mail to a single
host, a message sent to multiple addresses in different domains results in one
copy sent for each domain. However, only one copy should be sent, because the
user is routing all mail to a single host.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
