The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Two separate threads from an SLI application appear to gain access to the SLI
critical section, coinciding with an application's SLI call that hangs and never
completes. This problem was observed with a Win32 SLI application which
supported over 50 different threads, each calling the SLI interface. At times,
an SLI call would hang and fail to complete.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Winsli32.dll was not behaving correctly.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and
3.0sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
