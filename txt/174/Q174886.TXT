TITLE   :FIX: Gendbc Produces Error Message when View is Open in Workarea
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b; WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbvfp kbvfp600fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Gendbc.prg produces the following error message when run against a database:

   File 'c:\Temp\nnnnnnn.tmp' does not exist.

Where n represents a series of numbers identifying the .tmp file.

CAUSE
=====

A view is open in a workarea when Gendbc.prg is run against a database.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this error, close the Open View. Below are three ways to do this:

 - Close the open view using the Data Sessions window (or the View window in
   Visual FoxPro 3.0).

 - Select the view and issue a "USE" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Command window.

 - Issue a "CLOSE TABLES ALL" (without the quotation marks) in the Command
   window.

The last command, however, closes all open views and tables.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the error appears, the Ignore button in the Program Error dialog box can
be chosen and Gendbc will normally produce its proper output file.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Modify the Testdata database located in the Samples\Data folder.

2. Add a local view to the database based on the Employee table.

3. Run the view.

4. Save the view and close the Database Designer.

5. Click the Data Session menu in Windows. In Visual FoxPro 3.0, select View
   window from the Windows pad. In the Data Session (or View) window, both the
   Employee table and the view should be open.

6. In the Command window, type the following lines of code:

         SET DATABASE TO Testdata
         DO HOME()+"Tools\Gendbc\gendbc.prg" WITH "Ztest.prg"

7. The error appears.
