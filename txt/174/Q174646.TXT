CAUSE
=====

The access violation was caused by a 3270 client emulator sending a Close(SSCP)
message to the SNA Server which contained an incorrect "destination index"
(desti) value. The Close(SSCP) message is documented in the SNA Server Emulator
Interface Specification (EIS) included with SNA Server. The SNA Server EIS
interface is used by Attachmate Extra! The customer who reported this issue was
using various versions of the Attachmate Extra! 3270 emulator. The client
emulator reproduction scenario leading to this problem is not known.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to the SNA Server service is available which performs additional
validation checking on Close(SSCP) requests to prevent this access violation. If
SNA Server detects that an emulator sent an invalid request, the server will now
drop the message, disconnect the client connection, and log the following
event:

   Event ID: 9
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (1117) Internal message sequence error
   X'1117' Received an invalid message from a 3270 emulator

NOTE: Event 9 may also indicate a minor error not indicative of this problem or
even a session loss. This event will be enhanced in a future version of SNA
Server to indicate additional details of this error including the client machine
which caused the event to occur.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.1, 2.11,
2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, and 3.0 SP1.

A supported fix for SNA Server version 2.11 is now available, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.

This problem was corrected in SNA Server version 3.0 Service Pack 2. For
