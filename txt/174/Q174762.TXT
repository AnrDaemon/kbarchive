The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

In order to allow anonymous IMAP4 clients access to a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer that has no Public Information Store, a mailbox must be created in the
Private Information Store to act as the anonymous account. This account is then
specified on the Anonymous tab of the IMAP4 protocol's Properties dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When allowing anonymous access via the IMAP4 protocol on an Exchange Server
computer, an account called Anonymous is specified by default. If the server
does not contain a Public Information Store, a mailbox in the Private
Information Store must be created for anonymous user(s) to use to log on.

Additional query words: POP3
