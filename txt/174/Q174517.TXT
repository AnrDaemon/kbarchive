TITLE   :PRB: Office 97 SR-1 Patch Doesn't Update VB 5.0 Jet/DAO DLLs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have installed Office 97, then Visual Basic 5.0, then the Office 97
Service Release (SR-1) Patch file, the latest DLLs for Jet are not installed
correctly on your machine.

NOTE: This problem does not occur if you reinstall Office 97 SR-1 from the
installation CD-ROM; the problem occurs only if you install the SR-1 Patch file.

CAUSE
=====

The version of Microsoft Jet installed with Visual Basic 5.0 is not the same as
that which shipped with Microsoft Access 97. The Office 97 SR-1 Patch file does
not detect this; and therefore, does not replace files that are newer than
Office 97, but older than what is provided with Office 97 SR-1.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to avoid this problem:

 - Obtain the Office 97 SR-1 Patch on CD-ROM rather than the downloadable SR-1
   Patch file. The CD is available via MSDN Universal Subscription.

   -or-

 - Install Jet 3.51, which updates and replaces files installed by either Visual
   Basic 5.0 or Office 97 SR-1.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Jet 3.51 actually offers newer versions of the Jet engine than Office 97 SR- 1.
Installing Jet 3.51 provides you with the latest version of the Jet engine, and
nullifies the problem described above. In addition, you can use the version
information listed in the following table to confirm which version of Jet you
have installed on your machine.
