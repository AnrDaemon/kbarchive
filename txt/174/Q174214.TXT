SYMPTOMS
========

A Form with a menu displays a border and a titlebar when the BorderStyle
property of the form is set to 0-None. The Form displays a border even when the
Menus it contains are not visible.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic requires a Form with a Menu to have visible borders.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a second Form to contain your popup menu and use the PopupMenu method in
the first Form to access the Menu of the second Form.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This section provides instructions on how to create a borderless Form with a
popup menu.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Set the Form1 BorderStyle property to 0-None.

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Form2.Visible = False
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_MouseDown(Button As Integer, _
                                    Shift As Integer, _
                                    X As Single, _
                                    Y As Single)

            If Button = vbRightButton Then
               Form1.PopupMenu Form2.mnuMyMenu
            End If
         End Sub

4. Add a second Form to the project.

5. Use the menu editor to add a menu with three menu items to the second form.
   Name the menu mnuMyMenu.

6. Press the F5 key to run the program. The first form displays without a
   border. Right-click the form to display the menu items from the second form.
