TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Edit Messages After Exceeding Storage Limit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you exceed the storage limit set in the Exchange Administrator program for
users, and the Prohibit Send and Receive option is set on the Exchange Server
computer, you will not be able to edit any messages. Only deletion of messages
is permitted. If you receive a large message that causes your mailbox to exceed
the storage limit at once, and you are in the process of editing a message, you
will be unable to save the message you are working on. If you open the large
message that caused your mailbox limit to be exceeded, you will also be unable
to save any edits to that message or delete any attachments that may be
contained.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Permanently delete the large message or a few other smaller messages to bring
your mailbox below the allotted limits for storage.
