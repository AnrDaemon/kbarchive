PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to use Remote Control on a Windows NT client with Permission
Required set to Yes, the "Will you allow <username> to remote control your
machine?" dialog window does not appear when the client's computer is at the
Begin Logon screen, which displays the message "Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete to log
on".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

The permission window is displayed as soon as someone logs on to the client
computer. Also note that if the server times out because the client never logs
on when it is trying to start a Remote Control session, the permission dialog
box will appear the next time that a user logs on to the computer, even if the
server is no longer trying to establish a connection.
