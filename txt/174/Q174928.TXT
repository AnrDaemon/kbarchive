TITLE   :Dependencies Page Empty When Running Resource Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a new resource within an empty group, the Resource wizard may
present a Dependencies page that is empty.

CAUSE
=====

The Cluster Administrator tool displays the current state of the cluster.
Because there are no other resources in the group, a dependency cannot be
created for the resource being created. Therefore, the list of possible
resources with which to establish a dependency is blank. A group must have more
than one resource before dependencies may be established. The appearance of the
empty dependencies page may be confusing to some administrators.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server, Enterprise
Edition version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
