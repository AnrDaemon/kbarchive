PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If the Lotus Notes Site Address on an Exchange Server computer is set to use a
Notes domain name greater then 31 characters, only the first 31 will make it
over during directory synchronization (dirsync).

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server will dirsync over the entire site address name you have created,
even if the length exceeds 31 characters. Notes (on the receiving end) truncates
the name to 31 characters.
