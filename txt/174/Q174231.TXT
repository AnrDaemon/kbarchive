TITLE   :DHCP Uses 100% CPU If First Network Card Is Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a multihomed computer, you disable the loading of the network card driver (in
Control Panel, double-click Devices) or the driver fails to load because of a
problem. Following a restart, you observe excessive CPU usage by the Tcpsvcs.exe
process.


CAUSE
=====

When DHCP initializes, it attempts to open a socket on each TCP/IP interface.
Because the network card driver was disabled, this results in an error. The DHCP
service does not correctly handle this case.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Go to Control Panel and double-click Network.

2. Click the Bindings tab.

3. Select the network adapter that has the disabled driver.

4. Click Disable, and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
