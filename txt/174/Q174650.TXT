TITLE   :PRB: VBG Files Do Not Appear to Work with Visual SourceSafe
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600 kbVBp500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Visual Basic group file (.vbg) that contains multiple,
source-code controlled Visual Basic Projects (.vbp), only one .vbp appears to be
under Visual SourceSafe control.

CAUSE
=====

You have enabled the option to get the latest version of all the files when
opening the project, but Visual Basic is not able to perform the get latest
version on multiple projects simultaneously.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the option "Get latest checked-in versions of files when opening a VB
project" as follows:

1. On the Tools menu, select SourceSafe and then select Options.

2. Change the setting to "No" or "Ask".

This change may have wider implications for the functionality of the Visual
SourceSafe integration, which should be taken into account. It is only mentioned
here as a resolution to the specific problem described in this article.

-or-

All .vbp's that do not show as being source controlled must be removed from and
then added back to the .vbg. Visual SourceSafe integration then works with all
the .vbp's.

NOTE: In either case, to be sure you have the most recent copies of the project
files in your working folder, you must do "Get Latest Version..." for each
project in the group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic project (.vbp), save it as "Project1" and add it to
   Visual SourceSafe through the Visual Basic menus (that is, One the Tools
   menu, select Visual SourceSafe and then select Add Project to SourceSafe.)

2. From the File menu, choose Add Project and then add a new project. This will
   create a Project Group (.vbg) file.

3. Save the new .vbp as "Project2" and add it to Visual SourceSafe as in step 1.

4. Exit Visual Basic, and save the .vbg as "Group1" file when prompted.

5. Restart Visual Basic and open Group1.vbg - note that the Project Explorer's
   glyphs indicate that one .vbp is source controlled, while the other is not.
   The project that is not source controlled normally has a glyph indicating
   that it is read-only.
