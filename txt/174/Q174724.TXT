TITLE   :XWEB: Language of the Template and Message Content Don't Match
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a Microsoft Exchange Server message using Microsoft Outlook Web
Access, the message content may appear corrupt, even though other clients who
received the message can view it without a problem.

CAUSE
=====

Confirm that the language of the template and the language of the message
content match. If the message content requires a different code page and font
from the template, the message content will appear corrupt, even though it is
not.

RESOLUTION
==========

If this occurs, you must manually change your browser's code page to view the
message content correctly. Follow these steps for Microsoft Internet Explorer
3.0:

1. Click the Code Page shortcut menu in the right corner of the status bar.

2. Select the correct Code Page.

For Netscape Navigator 3.0, follow these steps:

1. From the Options menu, choose Document.

2. Select the correct Code Page.
