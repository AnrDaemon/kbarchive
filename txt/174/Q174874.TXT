TITLE   :FIX: Branched Files Restored to New Database Cause Corruption
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500bug kbVS97sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using SSARC/SSRESTOR Utilities to archive and restore files to a new database
can cause corruption to occur. The problem happens only when restoring files
that were previously branched into a different database. Analyze will report no
errors immediately after restoring the files to the new database. However, any
action adding a log record (such as labeling, sharing, branching, checking in,
etc.) to a problem file will cause corruption. When attempting to perform an
action on an affected file, you may see "file may be corrupt" errors followed by
an "error reading file" message.

Analyze can be used to fix the files after the corruption occurs, but the problem
can't be detected or repaired before an action is performed.

RESOLUTION
==========

You should use build 2221 of the Ssrestor.exe file, available in Visual Studio
Service Pack 3. If possible, using build 2222 of the Ssarc.exe file is also
recommended.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.
