TITLE   :PJL Control Commands May Cause Postscript Code to Print
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you print to a postscript printer in Windows NT, job output produced may
contain the entire flush of the postscript code rather than the actual desired
job output.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, Microsoft Windows NT issues Printer Job Language (PJL) commands for
job control purposes for postscript print drivers. This may cause undesirable
effects if you intend to redirect the output to a file for post processing by
other programs (for example, Page imposition program or PostScript preview
program). PJL was developed by Hewlett-Packard to provide a method for switching
printer languages at the job level, and for status readback between the printer
and the host computer. Please reference Hewlett-Packard's "Printer Job Language
Technical Reference Manual" for more details.


To turn off these job control commands in Windows NT, use the following
procedures:

Windows NT 3.51
---------------

1. In Print Manager, select the printer.

2. On the Printer menu, click Properties.

3. Click Details, click Job Defaults, and then click Options.

4. Click to clear the Page Independence check box.

   NOTE: In Windows NT 3.51, selecting the Page Independence check box allows
   pages to be printed or previewed out of order. Use this option if you are
   generating output to be used by a Page imposition program or a PostScript
   preview program. To improve print speed, do not check this option if you are
   printing directly to a printer.

   To preview a page or print a page out of sequence, select the Page
   Independence check box.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Select the printer, then click Document Defaults from the File menu.

3. Click the Advanced tab and expand the Document Options-Postscript Options
   tree.

4. Click the Generate Job Control Code check box and then click No.

   NOTE: In Windows NT 4.0, this specifies whether to generate job control code
   (such as adding CTRL+D at the beginning and end of the document, or PJL
   commands). If you print to an AppleTalk port, click No.

   Additionally, the setting for Generate Job Control Code is separated out from
   the Page Independence setting which can be found in the same location as step
   2 above. Page Independence is not enabled by default and has the same
   implications in Windows NT 4.0 as it does in Windows NT 3.51.
