The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a video card that has Accelerated Graphic Port (AGP) functionality,
the only video resolution mode that works correctly is VGA mode (640x480, 16
colors). Third-party video drivers do not function as expected, if at all. In
addition, when you open a command prompt window and then maximize the screen,
the screen turns black. You can press ALT+ENTER to make the screen a window.


CAUSE
=====

Support for AGP functionality is not part of the base operating system for
Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

AGP support has been added to Windows NT 4.0 in Service Pack 3. Obtain and
install the latest service pack.


STATUS
======
