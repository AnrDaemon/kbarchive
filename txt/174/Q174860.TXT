TITLE   :No Sound in Windows After Installing Close Combat
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsound kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Close Combat for Windows 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Close Combat, you no longer hear any sound in Windows.

This behavior has been reported to occur on some HP Pavilion computers using
Crystal sound cards.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs if an installation of DirectX replaced the Crystal sound card
driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to resolve the problem:

NOTE: You should follow this procedure each time DirectX replaces the Crystal
sound card driver. In the future, if you are prompted to update your sound card
driver during a DirectX installation, click No.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Double click Sound, Video, And Game Controllers to expand the branch.

5. Click the entry for MS Sound Driver to select it.

6. Click Remove, and then click OK to confirm the removal.

7. Click OK.

8. Restart Windows. After restarting, you will notice that Crystal 4232 Plug and
   Play Audio Hardware appears under Sound, Video, And Game Controllers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Removing the wrongly detected sound card driver from Device Manager and allowing
Windows to re-detect the Crystal hardware corrects the sound problem in Windows.
