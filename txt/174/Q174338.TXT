SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Internet Mail information service in Windows Messaging, your
dial-up connection to the Internet may disconnect after your messages have been
downloaded, even if your connection is established before you start Windows
Messaging.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Internet Mail information service is configured to
connect using your modem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure the Internet Mail information service to
connect using your existing connection to the network. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. Quit Windows Messaging if it is running.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Mail.

4. Click Internet Mail, and then click Properties.

5. Click the Connection tab, click Connect Using The Network, click OK, and then
   click OK again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you configure the Internet Mail information service to connect using the
network and you have a network adapter installed, you must connect to the
Internet before you start Windows Messaging. Otherwise, you receive the
following error message:

   You could not be logged on to mail server: <Mail Server>

   Be sure your account information for this server is accurate.
   If this problem persists, contact your Internet Service Provider.
