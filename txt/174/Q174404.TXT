TITLE   :BUG: Field Aliases Options in Expression Builder Dialog Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Report Writer, all the options in the Field Aliases section of the
Expression Builder Options dialog box are disabled. Therefore, the Report Writer
always adds alias names to the report field objects. This is not a problem in
the Visual FoxPro 3.0x.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem. First, issue a CREATE REPORT command
and select Quick Report from the Report menu bar. In the Quick Report dialog
box, clear the Add Alias option. Second, use the Report Wizard to create the
report. The Report Wizard does not place alias names on the field objects.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
