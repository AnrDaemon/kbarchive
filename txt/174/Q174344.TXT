SYMPTOMS
========

A delegate for another user's mailbox can read messages marked as Private using
the Microsoft Exchange Client. This behavior does not occur when using the
Microsoft Outlook client.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Outlook client is designed to filter messages marked as Private so
that only the intended recipient can view the message through his or her Inbox.
This filtering process prevents delegates from viewing the contents of private
messages that were intended for the original recipient only. The Microsoft
Exchange Client ignores this sensitivity property and displays the messages to
the delegate, as well as to the original recipient.

WORKAROUND
==========

To ensure privacy, have the delegate for the user's mailbox install and use the
Outlook client only.
