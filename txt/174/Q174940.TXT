SUMMARY
=======

If you create a File Share resource within a group using Microsoft Cluster
Server, it is important to establish a dependency with a physical disk resource.
If the physical disk resource is on the shared SCSI bus and a failure occurs
without the dependency, clients may receive the following error:

   Access Denied

MORE INFORMATION
================

The File Share resource type requires a dependency on a network name so the
share may be registered on the network. The resource does not place a mandatory
requirement on a physical disk resource that corresponds to a device on the
shared SCSI bus. This allows the use of other forms of storage under special
circumstances. This may include local storage for nonvolatile data in which the
same data exists on both nodes. Third-party data solutions may also fall into
this category.

If you use a device on the shared SCSI bus for a share's data storage and do not
establish a dependency between the File Share resource and the Physical Disk,
clients may receive access denied errors or other errors caused by a brief
failure of the device. This condition may be temporarily resolved by manually
taking the File Share resource offline and then returning it to online status.
If you establish the dependency first, this manual step is not necessary and the
condition does not occur. For best results when storing data on a device managed
by a Physical Disk resource, establish a dependency for the resources that rely
on the data source.
