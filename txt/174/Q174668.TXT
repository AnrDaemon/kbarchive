The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Attempting to register the Dbgrid32.ocx file with RegSvr32.exe, on a Windows NT
version 3.51 machine, where Visual C++ or Visual Basic is not installed, gives
the following error message:

   LoadLibrary failed GetLastError is 0x0000045a

MORE INFORMATION
================

When trying to use Dbgrid32.ocx, one must also include Grdkrn32.dll in the
Windows system directory apart from the other redistributable DLLs.

NOTE: When you run the setup wizard from Visual Basic, Grdkrn32.dll is mentioned
in the Swdepend.ini file that is created. Another source of information is the
Sw32tmpl.ini file found in vb\setupkit\kitfil32, where it says under
dbgrid32.ocx that a file named Grdkrn32.dll is also required.

This dependency is not present in the Dbgrid32.ocx file that ships with Visual
C++ 5.0.
