PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), the icons for accepted meeting requests
and tentative meeting requests appear exactly the same. The Subject line of the
meeting request shows the correct information about whether the meeting request
is Accepted or Tentative.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The icon for a tentative meeting request normally appears with a question mark,
whereas the icon for an accepted meeting request appears with a check mark. In
OWA, these icons both appear with a check mark.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
versions 5.0 and 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post additional
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
