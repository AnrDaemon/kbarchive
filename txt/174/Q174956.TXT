TITLE   :WINS, DHCP, and DNS Not Supported As Failover Resource
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Cluster Server does not support the configuration of the Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS), Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP), and Domain
Name Service (DNS) as failover resources.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cluster Server does not contain support for failover of a WINS server from one
node to another. WINS may use push/pull replication between two WINS servers,
allowing an alternate server for clients in the event that one server fails. The
client may configure for primary and secondary WINS servers. In the event that
one WINS server fails, the clients may use the other WINS server.

For additional information on WINS, please see the following white paper
available on the Microsoft anonymous FTP server:

   Title : "Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Windows Internet Naming Service
   (WINS) Architecture and Capacity Planning"

Windows 2000 supports DHCP and WINS on clusters for scalability and fault
tolerance. For additional information, click the article number below to view
