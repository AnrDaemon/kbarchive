PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. 
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring 
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help 
topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

The Shift Lock keyboard feature is not available by default in Windows NT 4.0.

The Shift Lock key is a key similar to Caps Lock key. If the keyboard layout has
a Shift Lock key instead of a Caps Lock key, capitalization can only be turned
on by pressing the Shift Lock key; capitalization can only be turned off by
pressing one of the Shift keys. This is the manual typewriter functionality that
Windows 95, Windows 3.1/3.11 and MS-DOS implement in the French, German, and
Belgian keyboard layouts.

With Windows NT 4.0 prior to Service Pack 4, the Shift Lock key turns on
capitalization; however, pressing the Shift key does not turn it off. With
Service Pack 4, the Shift key can now be used to turn capitalization off.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack



WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use

you are running Windows NT or Windows 2000, you should also update your
Emergency Repair Disk (ERD).

In addition to applying the service pack above, make the following registry
change:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control \Keyboard
   Layouts\xxxxxxxx

   example, 0000040C is the French keyboard Layout).

3. On the Edit menu, click Add and type the following value:

  Attributes DWORD  0x00010000
