was created by using the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup
wizard and that application includes Microsoft Graph 8.0, when you open a form
or report containing a graph, you may receive the following error message

   The dynamic link library MSO97.DLL could not be found in the specified path
   <'Path to Microsoft Office Directory'>; <'Path to Microsoft Windows
   System Directory'>.

followed by:

   The OLE object isn't registered. The object may be calling an application
   that isn't installed. To register the application, reinstall it.

products may cause this error message:
