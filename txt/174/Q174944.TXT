SUMMARY
=======

If you configure Microsoft Cluster Server to generate a diagnostic log file and
the Cluster service fails to start, it is possible that the log file may not
contain any data. If a previous log file existed prior to the attempt to start
the Cluster service, the old log file may remain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Cluster service fails to start because of a logon error for the service
account, or another system-related error, the service may not have a chance to
run. As a result, a new log file may not be created.

To run the Cluster service temporarily from a command prompt, use the following
procedure:

1. Open a new command prompt window.

2. Change to the cluster directory on the local system. Usually, this is
   %SystemRoot%\cluster.

3. Type "CLUSSVC /debug" (without the quotation marks)at the command prompt. The
   cluster service will send output to the window similar to what would normally
   be seen in the diagnostic log file. You may also capture this information in
   a file by using the following command syntax instead:

   CLUSSVC /debug > c:\debug.log

4. At the point that you are satisfied that the Cluster service is running
   properly, you may use CTRL+C from the keyboard to stop the service.

NOTE: This method runs the service outside of the normal environment given by the
Service Control Manager. To use this procedure, you must be logged on with
administrative rights. Do not use the -debug option for normal use or for any
length of time. The service does not run as efficiently with the option set;
hence, this option is intended for temporary diagnostic use only.
