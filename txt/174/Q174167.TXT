TITLE   :XFOR: Forum Password Security Lost After Collabra Migration
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


Collabra Share has the ability to set access passwords on individual forums. When
these forums are migrated into Microsoft Exchange Server, these access passwords
are not preserved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Migration Wizard imports Collabra Share forums as public folders into
Microsoft Exchange Server. Exchange does not set any type of access password on
a public folder. Exchange sets access permissions. During the migration phase,
the access permissions will be set for all folders based on the rights of the
logged-on Windows NT account when migration is performed.

You will be presented with the access permissions that will be used for all the
public folders that will be created. The Migration Wizard has no method of
setting access permissions on a single folder basis. However, you can set access
permissions on individual folders using the Exchange Administrator program after
migration is complete.

This behavior is by product design.
