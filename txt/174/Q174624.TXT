TITLE   :Improper Display Name for OEM Driver after Unattend Setup.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you complete an unattended installation of Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0 using the $OEM$\TEXTMODE option to install OEM SCSI device
drivers, the Control Panel SCSI Adapters tool will only display the driver name
instead of the full descriptions specified in the TXTSETUP.OEM [SCSI] section.

For complete details on $OEM$\TEXTMODE usage, refer to the Windows NT 4.0
Deployment Guide from:

http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/deploy/default.asp

NOTE: The Deployment Guide is valid for both Windows NT Workstation and Windows
NT Server.


CAUSE
=====

The absence of the full description in the SCSI Adapters applet is because of
the Key Name not being specified in the [SCSI] section of Txtsetup.oem.

The [SCSI] section of Txtsetup.oem consists of three components; the ID,
Description, and Key Name. If the last field Key Name is missing, the adapter
description is not used properly.

For Example:

If you click the Devices tab in the Control Panel SCSI Adapters tool, you will
see the device name as piixice.sys instead of the proper display name of Intel
PIIX PCI Bus Master IDE Controller as defined in Txtsetup.oem.

The Txtsetup.oem files [SCSI] section should consist of three components. The ID,
Description, and Key Name.

ID        Description                                Key Name
==        ===========                                ========
piixide = "Intel PIIX PCI Bus Master IDE Controller", piixide

NOTE: The ID and Key Name are the same.

For Example:

The information provided below is an example of an improper Textsetup.oem file.
Note the missing Key Name in the [SCSI] section.

   [Disks]
   d1 = "Intel PIIX PCI Bus Master IDE Controller", \disk1.nt, \ 

   [Defaults]
   scsi = piixide

   [SCSI]
   piixide = "Intel PIIX PCI Bus Master IDE Controller"  <-- Missing key name

   [Files.scsi.piixide]
   driver = d1,piixide.sys, piixide
   inf = d1,oemsetup.inf

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you need to add the Key Name to the entry under the
[SCSI] section.

This Texsetup.oem file below is configured properly to display a full
Description. Note the addition of the Key Name.

   [Disks]
   d1 = "Intel PIIX PCI Bus Master IDE Controller", \disk1.nt, \ 

   [Defaults]
   scsi = piixide

   [SCSI]
   piixide = "Intel PIIX PCI Bus Master IDE Controller", piixide

   [Files.scsi.piixide]
   driver = d1,piixide.sys, piixide
   inf = d1,oemsetup.inf
