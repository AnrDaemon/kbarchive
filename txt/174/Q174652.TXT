======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Executing a PrintForm method to print a maximized form results in only a portion
of the form being printed. This bug may also occur when you click Print on the
File menu to print a Form Image.

CAUSE
=====

The PrintForm method prints an image of the Form window in its normal state.
Those controls that are not visible on the Form when the Form's window state is
normal will not print.

RESOLUTION
==========

Workaround #1
-------------

To workaround this bug, resize the form so that all controls on the form display,
and then execute the PrintForm method.

Workaround #2
-------------

You can also workaround this problem by capturing the on-screen image of the form
and then printing that image. For more information, see the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

   Q161299 HOWTO: Capture and Print the Screen, a Form, or any Window

Please note that this workaround will not work in situations where the form is
larger than the display area, or if a portion of the form is not visible for any
other reason. For an alternate approach, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q178076 HOWTO: Use a PictureBox to Control Orientation Printing a Form

   Q230502 HOWTO: Print a Form That Is Too Large for the Screen or Page

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Maximize Form1 and place a command button on the lower-right corner of the
   form.

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit
         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Me.PrintForm
         End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the program. Maximize the form with the maximize button and
   then click the command button. Only part of the form is printed.
