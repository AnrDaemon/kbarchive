TITLE   :NMI Error Message on Blue Screen May Be Garbled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, the following symptoms may occur:

 - You receive a blue screen with garbled or random characters.

 - Your screen flickers.

 - Windows NT stops responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if there are more Non-maskable Interrupt (NMI) error
messages being generated than can be processed by the CPU. As a result, the
error messages cannot be displayed properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


NOTE: This fix only causes the NMI error messages to be displayed properly. It
does not resolve the error messages. To resolve the error messages, you should
correct the hardware problem that causes them. This fix prevents the initial
error message from being overwritten by subsequent error messages so that you
can determine the hardware problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When Windows NT starts, it uses a multitasking environment during error
processing. While error processing is occurring, it is possible for multiple
processes to detect problems. When this occurs, one error message can be
overwritten by another.


When physical memory, the system bus, or input/output (I/O) devices detect parity
errors, an error message is sent to the CPU using an NMI.
