TITLE   :XWEB: HTTP Protocol Still Functions After Disabling in Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is still possible to gain access to a mailbox via Outlook Web Access after
you disable the HTTP protocol in the Exchange Administrator program. In order to
completely disable this protocol, you must restart the World Wide Web Services
in Control Panel/Services.

If the HTTP protocol is disabled on the server, a client mailbox may still be
accessed by entering the logon address http://servername/exchange/Logon.asp into
the browser. After the service has been stopped and restarted, the mailbox will
no longer be accessible.

CAUSE
=====

This is a design implementation of Microsoft Internet Information Server.
