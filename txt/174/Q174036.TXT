TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange 5.0 IMS Won't Deliver Messages from 4.0 Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


This problem occurs when a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
receives an outbound message from a computer that is in the same site and is
running Exchange Server 4.0. The Internet Mail Service (IMS) does not deliver
the message and the following events are logged:

   Event ID 4116 MSExchangeIMC Internal Processing An error was returned from
   the messaging software the Internet Mail Service uses to process messages on
   the Microsoft Exchange Server. It is possible that the piece of mail being
   processed at the time will not be delivered. The message that was being
   processed has been moved to the "BAD" folder. Use the appropriate utilities
   found in the SUPPORT directory of your Exchange CD to view and manipulate
   these messages.

   Event ID 12802 MSExchangeIS Content Engine
   Error 0x8004010f during stream configuration.

CAUSE
=====

When a 4.0-generated message arrives at a 5.0 IMS via message transfer agent
(MTA), IMAIL fails during outbound conversion from the computer running Exchange
Server 5.0. Exchange Server 4.0 messages do not have the native codepage
property so the Exchange Server 5.0 IMS cannot deliver the message

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
