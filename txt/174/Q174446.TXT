SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a fax using Microsoft Exchange or Windows Messaging, the
fax may not be sent although the fax does appear in the Sent Items folder.

CAUSE

This behavior can occur if an unnecessary "1" is entered in the For Long
Distance box in Dialing properties. Dialing properties is designed to
automatically add a "1" before a telephone number that has an area code
different from your own.

RESOLUTION
==========

this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
   Modems.

2. Click Dialing Properties, and then remove the unnecessary "1" from the For
   Long Distance box.

3. Click OK, and then click OK.
