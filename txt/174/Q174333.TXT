TITLE   :Installing Win95 Print Drivers on WinNT 4.0 Asks for Wrong Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When sharing a printer on a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Server or
Workstation with Windows 95 clients where the Windows 95 drivers are installed
on the server, the wizard prompts you with the following message:

   Please insert the floppy disk labeled 'Windows 95' into drive A:
   and then click OK.

This message is misleading because, after inserting a Windows 95 floppy disk or
CD-ROM and clicking OK, you receive the error message:

   Alternate Drivers Cannot Be Installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 files on floppy disks and CD-ROMs are cabinet files with .cab
extensions. Windows NT does not search the contents of the cabinet files for the
necessary printer driver files, such as .inf, .ini, .dll, or .drv.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT will not be changed to expand Windows 95 cabinet files during printer
installation; however, there is now an updated version of Ntprint.dll, which
provides a better description of the actual disk that is needed. After applying
this version of Ntprint.dll, when you install the Window 95 printer drivers, you
will be prompted for the following message:

   Please insert the disk labeled "Windows 95 Flat share" into drive A:.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
