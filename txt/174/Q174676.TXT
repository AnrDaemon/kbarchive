SYMPTOMS
========

After you log off and then back on to a Novell NetWare server using Client
Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW), you may
receive the following error message:

   NetWare Authentication Failure

   You cannot be authenticated on <NetWare Tree and Context> due to the
   following reason: A connection to the server could not be made because
   the limit on the number of concurrent connections for this account has
   been reached.

   Do you want to select another preferred server or context?

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT does not disconnect from the NetWare server before attempting to log
on again, and the setting to limit concurrent connections for your NetWare user
account is enabled and set to 1 on the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
