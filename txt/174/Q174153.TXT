TITLE   :XFOR: Incorrect Character Mappings when MSFS32.DLL Doesn't Match

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When migrating data from a localized version of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
to Microsoft Exchange Server, some characters may not be mapped correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Mail (PC) migration component of the Migration Wizard accesses the
postoffice by using the Microsoft Mail Messaging Application Programming
Interface (MAPI) service. The Migration Wizard includes the version of the
Microsoft Mail MAPI service for the appropriate server language: U.S., French,
German, or Japanese. The Microsoft Mail MAPI service assumes the postoffice is
in the default code page for that language. For French, German, and U.S., this
is code page 850. For Japanese, this is code page 932. If the postoffice uses a
different code page, some non-7 bit ASCII characters will be mapped incorrectly
during migration because the characters are actually in one code page but
assumed to be in another.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, you must use the localized version of the Microsoft
Mail MAPI service that matches the language of the postoffice (Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks 3.x) from which you are migrating. For example, if you want to
migrate a Swedish postoffice to a computer running an English version of the
Administrator program, first copy the Swedish Microsoft Mail Msfs32.dll file in
the Windows\System32 directory over the English Msfs32.dll file prior to running
the Migration Wizard. This prevents the message subject from being truncated to
40 characters.

For Far East postoffices, the DBCS-enabled Microsoft Mail MAPI service gathers
its settings from the Windows NT environment. Therefore, to migrate a Korean
postoffice, install the Migration Wizard on a Korean Windows NT computer.

The following lists the postoffice code pages and the corresponding Windows NT
code pages the data is translated into.
