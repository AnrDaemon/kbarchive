SYMPTOMS
========

After you rename a printer and restart a computer running Windows NT Server or
Workstation, the printer share may no longer be seen by Windows 95 and other
non-Windows NT clients. The printer share is also missing when you use the NET
VIEW command. The following error may occur when you connect to the printer
share with a NET USE command:

   System error 67 has occurred.
   The network name cannot be found.

In the Printers folder, the printer continues to display the sharing symbol,
indicating it is shared.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the printer, and then click Sharing.

3. Click Not Shared, and then click OK.

4. Right-click the printer again, and then click Sharing.

5. Click Shared, and then click OK.

The printer share will now be available to remote users and the NET VIEW and NET
USE commands will work properly.
