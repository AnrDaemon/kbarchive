TITLE   :Restoring the Security Menu in Explorer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you right-click a folder on an NTFS drive and then click Properties, one or
more tabs may not be present (for example, the Security tab).

CAUSE
=====

Some third-party programs modify the OLE automation information in the registry
so that they can add or remove items in Windows NT Explorer context menus (for
example, the Security tab). If the removal of the application does not properly
replace the original information, normal functions within Windows NT Explorer
may not be available.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to resolve this problem by restoring the registry. For
information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry" Help topic
in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
