TITLE   :Resource Parameters Tab Is Missing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you successfully install Microsoft Cluster Administrator, the application
runs, and can connect to and administer clusters.

However, when accessing resources, they do not appear to have a Parameters tab.
Also any new resources that are created have a finish button instead of a next
button at the dependency portion of the resource wizard.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a corrupt or outdated resource extension .dll in
%systemroot%\cluster.

WORKAROUND
==========

Ensure that the Cluadmex.dll and Debugex.dll files have the correct size and
version information. If the files are corrupt, they may require replacement. You
may also delete the %systemroot%\cluster directory and reinstall the
application.

The following information is the correct file size and version information for
Cluadmex.dll and Debugex.dll:

Cluadmex.dll:

   Size: 131,344 bytes
   Version: 1.00.224.0

Debugex.dll:

   Size: 57,616 bytes
   Version: 1.0.0.1
