KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, when you double-click an equation and then click Arrange All
on the Window menu to view two documents containing equations, you may notice
the following behavior with the Equation toolbar:

 - You are unable to close the toolbar.

   When you activate the Microsoft Equation Editor in one document, click the
   second document to activate it, and then click to re-activate the first
   document, you will not be able to close the Equation toolbar by clicking the
   close button (the "X") on the title bar.

 - The buttons disappear from the toolbar.

   When you first view the two documents containing equations in the arrange all
   view, the Equation toolbar will appear as expected. However, after you click
   the insertion point several times between the two document windows, the
   Equation Editor toolbar will not be refreshed properly and buttons will
   disappear.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for the behavior you are
experiencing.

Cannot Close the Equation Toolbar
---------------------------------

Method 1: View One Document at a Time:

Do not click Arrange All on the Window menu. Work on equations in one document at
a time.

Method 2: Keep the Insertion Point Within a Single Document:

If you must use the Arrange All feature, follow these steps to re-enable the
close button:

1. In the document in which Equation Editor is active, click outside the
   Equation object to move the insertion point into that document.

   This will close the Equation Editor and its toolbar in that document.

2. Double-click the same equation to re-activate equation editor.

3. Keep the insertion point in the document in which Equation Editor is active.

You should be able to close the Equation toolbar by clicking the close button
("X") in the title bar of the Equation toolbar.

Method 3: Use the Menu to Close the Toolbar:

1. Click the insertion point in the document in which you first activated
   Equation Editor.

2. On the View menu, click Toolbar.

   The check mark next to the command should be removed.

3. Click the document to select it.

   This will remove the focus from the equation object.

4. Double-click the same equation to re-activate equation editor.

5. Keep the insertion point in the document in which Equation Editor is active.

You should be able to close the Equation toolbar by clicking the close button
("X") in the title bar of the Equation toolbar.

Equation Editor Buttons Missing
-------------------------------

To display the Equation Editor buttons, move the mouse pointer over the space
where the buttons should be displayed. The buttons should reappear.
