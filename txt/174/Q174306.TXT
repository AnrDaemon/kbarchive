 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you attempt to delete the Internet Newsgroups public folder, while logged on
to an Exchange Server mailbox that has the role of owner for that folder, you
may receive the following error message:

   An item could not be deleted. You do not have sufficient permission to
   perform this operation on this object. See the folder contact of your system
   administrator.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Internet Newsgroups public folder cannot be deleted; however, it can be made
not visible or renamed by a mailbox with the role of owner. To make the Internet
Newsgroups public folder not visible, do the following:

1. From the Exchange Administrator program, look at the properties of the
   Internet Newsgroups public folder.

2. On the General Tab, click the Client Permissions button.

3. Highlight default and anonymous names, and uncheck the Folder Visible option
   for both.

4. Click OK to apply changes on the client permissions for the public folder.

The Internet Newsgroups public folder will no longer be visible to clients
accessing the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.
