SYMPTOMS
========

When you index German documents containing compound words with "[ASCII 228]",
"[ASCII 246]", "[ASCII 252]", these compound words will not be indexed by Index
Server version 1.1. When you search for those documents, you will get the
following error message:

   No documents found.

CAUSE

The wordbreaker DLL that splits compound words into single words only indexes
these compound words.

RESOLUTION

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows 2000 Indexing Service.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the following files from Index Server version 2.0:

 - Sccfa.dll

 - Sccfi.dll

 - Sscut.dll

Copy them in the \Winnt\System32 directory and then re-index everything.
