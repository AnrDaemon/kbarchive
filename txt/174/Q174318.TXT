 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the language encoding of Web page that contains multiple languages
to UTF-8, and then view the page in a Web browser, incorrect characters may be
shown.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Open your multilingual Web page in Word.

2. On the File menu, click Properties.

3. In the Document Properties dialog box, under For Saving This Page, click to
   select the correct language set your page contains, and then click OK.

   NOTE: This procedure works when your page contains text typed in a different
   language in addition to English. If your page contains English and two or
   more additional languages, there may not be a language encoding option
   available to correctly show all of the text when viewed in a Web browser.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
