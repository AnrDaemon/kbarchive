TITLE   :Control Panel Date/Time Tool Changes the Date
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 win98

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the date in the Date/Time tool in Control Panel, the change is
effective without having to click Apply or OK. This can cause problems for
programs that record or use the date for logging purposes.

CAUSE
=====

Changes to the Date/Time tool in Control Panel are effective immediately for
date operations.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, it is recommended that you synchronize your date
with a computer on your network. To do this, type the following command at the
command prompt, and then press ENTER:

net time [\\computername | /domain[:domainname]] [/set]

Alternatively, make sure that any services that record data along with date
information are paused or stopped while the date is changed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
