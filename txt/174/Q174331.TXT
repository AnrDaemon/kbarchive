SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to add a second Time Server resource within a single cluster
using Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS), an error message similar to the following
text may be displayed:

   An error occurred attempting to read properties for the 'Time2'
   resource. The cluster resource could not be created in the specified
   resource monitor. Error ID: 5017 (00001399)

In MSCS, a single cluster may have only one Time Service resource. If you
attempt to add another, the error message may appear. The same message may also
appear if you attempt to use a separate resource monitor for the resource.
