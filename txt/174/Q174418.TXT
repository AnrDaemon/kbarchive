TITLE   :Internal Commands not Recognized by Schedule Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows NT 3.51, output from a batch file run by the Schedule service can be
redirected to a log file. An example of this procedure is:

      AT 10:00 "dir > c:\logfile.txt"

The resulting contents of C:\Logfile.txt would be a directory listing of the
current directory. However, the same command issued in Windows NT 4.0 will
produce the following example:

   Added a new job with job ID = 0

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows NT 4.0, the Schedule service no longer understands internal commands
as it did in Windows NT 3.51. The Schedule service in Windows NT 4.0, writes a
confirmation that the job has been scheduled to the log file. To redirect output
of internal commands to a text file, create a batch job and schedule the batch
job using the "cmd /c" switch. Modifying the previous example, you would type:

AT 10:00 cmd /c c:\batchfile.bat

where the contents of batchfile.bat are:

     Dir > c:\logfile.txt

The resulting contents of c:\logfile.txt would be a directory listing of the
current directory.
