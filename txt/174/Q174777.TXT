TITLE   :Searching for One Character Words in Index Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you search for a string, for example, "C++" (without the quotes), Index
Server will return the following error message:

   The query contained only ignored words. (0x80041605) encountered
   while processing the query "c++".

CAUSE
=====

Both the neutral and English wordbreakers strip the trailing "++" characters,
because they are not part of a linguistic word.

An escape feature exists for special characters such as "&" and "|", because
they have special meaning in the query syntax. However, the "+" character has no
such special meaning.

Also, even with escapes, the query "c(" will be converted to "c", which is a
noise-word-only query.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is corrected in Windows 2000 Indexing Service. Any words ending
with ++, +, - and ! are passed to the engine and not considered noise words. To
resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows 2000 Indexing Service.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the letter "c" from the noise files: Noise.enu and Noise.dat. In that
case searching for "c++" will be the same as searching for the letter "c".

NOTE: After you edit the noise files, you will need to reindex all of the virtual
roots.

STATUS
======

This problem is corrected in Windows 2000 Indexing Service.
