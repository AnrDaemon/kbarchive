TITLE   :XCLN: Received Time Shows as None in Outlook Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.01,8.02,8.03,8.04
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.01, 8.02, 8.03, 8.04 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Outlook 97, messages have a Received time of None, instead of the
usual date and time values.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the message was sent while working with a Personal
Folder (PST) file as the primary information store or while working offline with
an Offline Folder (OST) file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Outlook 97 listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Microsoft Outlook 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior may cause problems, such as sorting messages by the Received
field. Because these messages have a value of None in the Received field, they
are automatically sorted to the top or bottom (depending on the sort order) of
the message list.

If a message is moved to the Sent Items folder under the conditions in the CAUSE
section above, the message will be properly archived. Messages with None as
Received Date that are moved to any folder other than the Sent Items folder will
not be archived.

Note: In this scenario, the Received time for a message sent by the user is
essentially the equivalent to the Sent time. This is due to the fact that the
message is "received" in the Sent Items folder at approximately the same time
the message is sent by the user.
