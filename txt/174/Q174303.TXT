TITLE   :BUG: ListBox Caption Changes When Copied as Control Array
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ListBox control that is copied as a control array results in a different
caption. This behavior differs from other Visual Basic controls; other controls
copied as a control array contain the same caption text as the original control.

RESOLUTION
==========

The ListBox caption cannot be changed.

The purpose of the ListBox caption is for control identification in the IDE only.
The ListBox caption has no effect on the control at run-time or in the made EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in products listed above. Microsoft
is researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a ListBox control and two other controls such as a Command button and a
   Combo box. Select all three controls, and then triple-click the Left property
   to arrange the controls vertically.

3. Select all three controls, and then click Copy on the Edit menu. From the
   Edit menu, click Paste. Click Yes when asked to create a control array for
   each of the three controls.

   Result: Note that the ListBox caption text changes while the caption of the
   other controls remain the same.
