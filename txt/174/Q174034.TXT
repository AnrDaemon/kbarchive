SUMMARY
=======

In Outlook Web Access (OWA), if you choose the Delete button in a Meeting
Request window, the following message will appear:

   The attendees have not been notified that this meeting has been canceled.
   Press OK to notify the attendees or Cancel to delete the meeting without
   notification.

NOTE: There is no way to cancel the operation and keep the meeting in your
schedule at this point. It will be deleted.

If you select OK, you are presented with a message that can be sent to the
originator of the meeting request. You can either select the Close button or the
Send button. Whether or not the message is sent, the meeting is deleted from
your schedule.

If you select Cancel, the meeting is removed from your schedule, and the
originator of the meeting request is not notified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by product design.
