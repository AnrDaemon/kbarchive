TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Migration Does Not Create PST File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Exchange Server Migration Wizard for Lotus
cc:Mail to migrate users from a Lotus cc:Mail version 8 post office to a PST
file, the Migration Wizard will not create a PST file if the cc:Mail users have
no messages in their cc:Mail account.

CAUSE
=====

A PST file is created from a User.pri file, not from a Primary.pri file. If
there is no mail in the cc:Mail account to extract, a User.pri file is not
created, thus no PST is created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Migration from a cc:Mail version 6 post office will create a PST file regardless
of whether the user has mail or not. Lotus cc:Mail version 6 uses a different
source extractor logic.
