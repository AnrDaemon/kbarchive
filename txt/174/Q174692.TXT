TITLE   :OLE Objects Don't Display Correctly on Macintosh Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:8.0; WINDOWS:4.0,5.0; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view an embedded OLE object in the Macintosh client that
originated from a Windows client, you do not see the object or you see an object
with question marks.

WORKAROUND
==========

Attempt to send the graphic as an attachment to the message. When the message is
opened on the Macintosh client, you may be able to open the image.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange client for
the Macintosh versions 4.0 and 5.0 and for the Microsoft Outlook client for the
Macintosh version 8.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a current limitation of OLE between Windows and the Macintosh. Bitmap
images are native to Windows environments and not to the Macintosh.

The following information is taken from the Exchange Server 5.0 Macintosh Release
Notes, section 1.10:

   When sending messages containing embedded OLE objects between Windows and
   Macintosh platforms, the embedded object may not display correctly when you
   open the file.

Additional query words: cut copy
