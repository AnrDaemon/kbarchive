-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change your password, you receive an error indicating that it does not
meet the domain password requirements; however, the stated requirements have
been met.

CAUSE
=====

Normally, this message is correct; however, when strong passwords are required
there may be restrictions in effect that will exclude many passwords.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


NOTE: The hotfix will need to be applied to all clients. The client is
responsible for mapping a text message to the error code returned from the
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The old password error message was:

   Your new password does not meet the minimum length or password history
   requirements of the domain.

The new messages displayed after you apply the fix are:

   Your new password does not meet the minimum length or password history
   requirements of the domain. Also, your site may require passwords that must
   be a combination of upper case, lower case, numbers, and non-alphanumeric
   characters.

   Your password must be at least <#> characters long. Your new password
   cannot be the same as any of your previous <#> passwords. Also, your
   site may require passwords that must be a combination of upper case, lower
   case, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.

The numeric <#> in the previous dialog box comes from the Account Policy in
User Manager.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
