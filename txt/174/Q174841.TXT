MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete

that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

The value name starts with 0 and progresses sequentially with no gaps. You may
Add Value, change the text of a value, or delete the last or all values and
start over.

The Tips are stored as sequentially named REG_SZ entries in:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
\Explorer\Tips

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

The control for the Tips is user based and is located at:

HKEY_USERS\<User's ID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
\Explorer\Tips

as two (2) REG_BINARY entries.

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

Show: Controls whether the Tips are displayed. 01000000 enables the display,
while 00000000 disables it.

Next: Controls which Tip is displayed next. 00000000 displays Tip 0, 01000000
displays Tip 1 and 0a000000 displays Tip 10.
