SUMMARY
=======

The Web Authoring Tools support the ability to perform an administrative
installation for use with "Run From Network Server" installations of Word.

To update the Web Authoring Tools in a "Run From Network Server" environment, use
the steps described in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following list of steps must be performed to properly create a "Run From
Network" installation of the updated Web Authoring Tools:

1. Download the latest version of the Web Authoring Tools file, Wd97au.exe, to a
   client machine that has been set up to run Word from the server.

   For more information about where to obtain the latest version of the Web
   Authoring Tools, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:

   Q163299 WD97: Web Page Authoring Tools AutoUpdate

2. When given the choice to either save to disk or open the Wd97au.exe, click
   Save To Disk.

3. Ensure there are no users running Word 97 from the server.

4. On the client machine, from the Windows 95 Start menu, click Run.

5. Type in the following Setup script, substituting the path in the following
   example for the path location of the Wd97au.exe you downloaded in steps 1 and
   2.

   c:\Windows\Desktop\Wd97au.exe /c:serverau.inf

   This executes a special version of the Setup script which will install the
   updated Web authoring components to the server.

6. You must restart Windows at the client machine you ran the setup script from
   before the updated settings will take effect. The Server does not need to be
   restarted.

7. After restarting the client machine, users at other workstations will see the
   changes the next time they start or install Word 97.

This method does not install the Web Publishing Wizard. The Web Publishing Wizard
must be set up on each computer. To set up the Web Publishing Wizard, use the
following steps:

1. Copy or download the Wd97au.exe to each client machine setup to run Word from
   the server.

2. If Word is currently running, exit Word.

3. Type in the following Setup script, substituting the path in the following
   example for the path location of the Wd97au.exe you downloaded or copied in
   step 1.

   c:\Windows\Desktop\wd97au.exe /c:wpfull.inf

   This executes a special version of the setup script which will install the
   Updated Web Publishing Wizard components to the client machine.
