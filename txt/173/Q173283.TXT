-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you are using Netscape Navigator to connect to Microsoft Exchange Server, you
must explicitly enter \\ to denote your logon parameters. Netscape Navigator
does not convert "\" to "\\" and as a result, you will not be able to enter:

   NT_Domain\User_Name\Mailbox

and successfully logon. You must enter:

   NT_Domain\\User_Name\\Mailbox

to successfully logon.

Additional query words: POP3 Netscape fail logon
