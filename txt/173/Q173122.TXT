KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Systems Management Server to Remote Control a Windows NT client
computer, the system running the Systems Management Server Administrator utility
may be unable to use the mouse or keyboard to control the remote Windows NT
client computer.

Mouse pointer and keyboard input will not have an effect on the client even
though screen updates continue to occur. This problem usually occurs after a few
minutes of normal remote control usage.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
