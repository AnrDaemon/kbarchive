TITLE   :Using Microsoft Windows 95 Drivers for Point and Print on WinNT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0:Win95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 95 drivers for point and print on a Windows NT 4.0
print server, some printer models are not listed in either the Msprint.inf or
Msprint2.inf files.

CAUSE
=====

Some printer models, including the HP LaserJet 5Si printer, are not available on
the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following methods to work around this problem:

Method 1
--------

Substitute the printer driver on the Windows NT 4.0 server with another
compatible printer driver. For example, when creating the HP LaserJet 5Si
printer, choose HP for Manufacturer and HP LaserJet 4Si for the Printer Model.
Use the following list as a possible substitution table:

+----------------------------------+
| Printer Type | Driver to Install | 
+----------------------------------+
| HP 5Si       | HP 4Si            | 
+----------------------------------+
| HP 5Si MX    | HP 4Si MX         | 
+----------------------------------+
| HP 5Si MX PS | HP 4Si MX PS      | 
+----------------------------------+

The only functionality that may be lost when using the HP LaserJet 4Si driver for
a HP LaserJet 5Si printer is the add-on options such as envelope feeder, duplex
printing, and any other options that are not considered standard.

Method 2
--------

Use a third-party printer driver that complies with the Windows95 and Windows NT
4.0 specification for .inf files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The basic design for a Printer.inf file can be found in the Windows Device
Driver Kit (DDK) and Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit Appendix C, ISBN 1-
55615-678-2. Please contact the manufacturer. In addition, the Readme.txt file
supplied with the third-party driver may also contain information on whether or
not that driver is supported for Point and Print.
