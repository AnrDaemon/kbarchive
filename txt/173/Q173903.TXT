TITLE   :XFOR: Changing the TCP Port Used for SMTP Mail

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article tells you how to configure the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet
Mail Service (IMS) to use a TCP port other than port 25 to receive SMTP mail.
This is a function of the TCP/IP protocol and is controlled by the entry in the
Services file in the Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc directory. This change is
required if you are using the new Mail Virus Scan from Symantec; the Symantec
product requires forwarding to the SMTP gateway by way of a port other than port
25.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Edit the Services file, Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc\Services, to specify the
   port used for SMTP.

   The following example, an excerpt from the Services file, shows removing SMTP
   from port 25 and enabling SMTP on port 17. Port 17 is normally used for
   'qotd' (quote of the day) service.

         smtp 17/tcp mail
         #qotd 17/tcp quote
         #qotd 17/udp quote
         chargen 19/tcp ttytst source
         chargen 19/udp ttytst source
         ftp-data 20/tcp
         ftp 21/tcp
         telnet 23/tcp
         #smtp 25/tcp mail
         time 37/tcp timserver

2. Telnet ip_address or server_name 17 to verify that the Internet Mail Service
   is indeed listening on tcp port 17.
