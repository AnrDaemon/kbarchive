TITLE   :XADM: Active User Count doesn't Contain Anonymous User Count
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you display the following Windows NT Performance Monitor (PerfMon) counter,
it will not include the number of Anonymous Users connected to the Microsoft
Exchange Information Store (IS):

   Object: MSExchangeIS
   Counter: Active User Count

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The number of Anonymous Users connected to the IS can be monitored by its own
PerfMon counter. The following counter will give you this information:

   Object: MSExchangeIS
   Counter: Active Anonymous User Count.

The Active User Count is the number of users that have displayed activity in the
past 10 minutes. By default, if an Anonymous user is idle for 10 minutes, they
will be disconnected from the IS. This value is configurable. To get the total
number of Active Users connected to the IS, you must add the totals of these 2
counters together.
