TITLE   :XADM: User's GAL Displayed Differently Based on Search Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the Search Control permission is used to limit directory access, the global
address list (GAL) can be displayed differently on a user-by-user basis. The GAL
will be displayed to the user as the container that has the largest number of
entries where that user is a member.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange 5.5 introduces a new feature known as Search Control. This feature is
implemented as a search permission on individual containers. By default, no
search attributes are set. All users have access to all address containers.
After the search attribute is set for one user, this container and all
subcontainers will not be displayed to any other user unless they have been
granted the search permission on the specific container. The search permission
will flow down to all child containers. Please refer to the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator's Guide for more information.
