TITLE   :XADM: Event 1016 When You Open Mailbox or Schedule
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access another user's mailbox or schedule, Microsoft
Exchange generates the following event in the Application Event log:

   Event ID: 1016
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Success Audit
   Category: Logons
   NT User DOMAIN\username logged on to John Doe mailbox, and is not the primary
   Windows NT account on this mailbox.

This occurs even if you have permission to access the mailbox, and it occurs
regardless of whether your attempt is successful or unsuccessful.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

Exchange records Event 1016 in the Event Log regardless of how you set the
diagnostics logging level on the Information Store.

The decision to log this error was made with security in mind. It is important
that any possible security breach be logged. If this type of logging were
suppressed, an actual breach of security would not be logged.
