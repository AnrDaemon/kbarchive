TITLE   :XADM: Mbclean.exe Deletes Outlook Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you run the Mbclean.exe utility from the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit
(BORK) to delete all messages over a certain age, Mbclean.exe also deletes
users' Outlook Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks items.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Resource Kit utility Mbclean.exe, from the Microsoft BackOffice
Resource Kit, is a tool that deletes all messages older than a certain date.
Therefore, Mbclean.exe also deletes Calendar, Contact, and Task items you have
created in Outlook, if those items are older than the number of days specified.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mbclean.exe in the Microsoft
BackOffice Resource Kit. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have users who store Calendar, Contact, or Task items on the server, you
should not use the current Mbclean.exe utility from the BackOffice Resource Kit
to delete all messages over a certain age.
