The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some cities or regions may have more than one area code, and calls between these
area codes may not be long-distance calls.

Because Windows 95 is designed to add a 1 before a telephone number if the number
has a different area code than your own, if you want to dial an MSN, The
Microsoft Network, access number with a different area code as a local call, you
must reconfigure the modem dialing properties to use different rules.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To dial an MSN access number with a different area code as a local call, use the
following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Modems.

3. Click the modem you are using, and then click Dialing Properties.

4. Under Where I Am, click New.

5. Type a name for the location, and then click OK.

6. In the Area Code Is box, type the area code of the MSN access number you want
   to dial.

7. Under How I dial from this location, click the Dial Using Calling Card check
   box to select it, and then click New.

8. Type a name for the new calling card, click OK, and then click Advanced.

9. Use the following table to configure the Dialing Rules dialog box:

      Field                             Dialing Rule
      ----------------------------------------------
      Calls Within The Same Area Code   FG
      Long Distance Calls               1FG
      International Calls               011EFG

   Meaning of the Dialing Rules:
