TITLE   :SNA Manager Fails to Open Backup Config File.
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the SNA Manager while the Windows NT Server computer that hosts
the primary SNA Server computer is not reachable, the following message is
displayed:

   From SNAOLE - Configuration file not found.

When you click OK in response to this message, SNA Manager reports the following
on the information bar of the subdomain window:

   CONFIG READ FAILED rc = 3935

CAUSE
=====

This only happens if the backup SNA Server computer where SNA Manager is running
was able to read the configuration file from the Primary SNA Server when it
started. The configuration path in the shared memory then points to the primary
SNA Server computer because that is the currently active configuration file.
There is no mechanism to switch to a backup configuration file other than at
startup time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, if SNA Manager fails to open the currently active
configuration file, the following message is displayed:

Unable to open the Primary SNA Server configuration file. Okay to attempt opening
a Backup SNA Server in read-only mode?

If you click OK, SNA Manager looks for a backup configuration file to open.
