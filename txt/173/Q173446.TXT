SUMMARY
=======

A site certificate is the digital equivalent of an identification card in the
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public key encryption system. The site certificate
is sent along with an encrypted message to verify that the sending Web site is
truly the Web site identifying itself in the transmission.

For added security, you can configure MSN, The Microsoft Network, to use only
site certificates issued by the site certificate providers that you specify.
Consequently, you are able to view only Web sites that have site certificates
issued by the specified site certificate providers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure MSN to use only site certificates issued by the site certificate
providers that you specify, use the following steps:

1. Right-click the MSN icon on the desktop, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Content tab.

3. Under Certificates, click Authorities.

4. To add or remove a site certificate provider, click the check box to the left
   of the certificate provider to select or clear it.

   Close, and then click OK.
