KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdisplay kbgraphic

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you run a Java applet on a multiprocessor computer using a Matrox MGA
Mellenium video card, the applet window is erased when moving the window around
the screen. The applet window goes white and does not refresh after being moved.
The Java applet window may also leave blotches of the white screen behind after
being moved.

The symptom is more apparent in true color.

This problem does not happen on the same system running one CPU.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
