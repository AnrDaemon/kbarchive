TITLE   :GetTextExtentPoint32W May Fail with Unicode Characters > 0x
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In certain instances under Windows NT 4.0, application code that uses the
GetExtentPoint32W API and the lpszText parameter to point to text containing
certain Unicode characters may fail. Using GetLastError() to find the problem in
the code will have no return code. The same application running under Windows NT
3.51 does not have this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using a debugging tool to single-step through a failing application may reveal
that the function fails if the data at the lpszText pointer contains extended
characters. These characters include umlauts, grave accents, and so on, or any
Unicode characters greater than hex value 0x100. This problem is difficult to
reproduce because the application code may work fine if cStrTest is on the
stack.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
