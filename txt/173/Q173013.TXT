The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create or update the table of contents, Microsoft Word may not include
heading numbers for all items.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the table of contents contains an item based on a
document heading with Auto Numbering, and that item contains an equation or a
symbol in a font other than Normal Text as the first character.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Replace Symbols with Normal Text
------------------------------------------

Remove all symbols that are the first characters of document headings, or replace
the symbols with similar ones in the Normal Text font. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. In the main document, select the symbol that is first character of the
   document heading.

2. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

3. Click the Symbols tab, and then click (Normal Text) in the Font list.

4. Click to select a similar symbol in Normal Text, to replace the existing
   symbol.

5. Click Insert, and then click Close.

6. Update the Table of Contents. To do this, follow these steps:

   a. On the Insert menu, click Index and Tables.

   b. Click the Table of Contents tab.

   c. Click OK.

   d. Click OK when you are prompted with the message:

   Do you want to replace the selected table of contents?

7. Repeat steps 1-6 for all document headings that are not numbered in the table
   of contents.

NOTE: After the heading numbers are properly displayed in the table of contents,
you can lock the table of contents field by pressing CTRL+F11. When the field is
locked, you cannot modify the table of contents. If you later need to modify it,
place the insertion point in the table of contents, and press CTRL+SHIFT+F11 to
unlock the field.

Method 2: Unlink the Table of Contents
--------------------------------------

You can also change the table of contents from a field to ordinary text, and then
modify the table of contents manually. To do this, follow these steps:

NOTE: You cannot automatically update the table of contents after this
procedure.

1. Remove the symbols that are the first characters of any document headings.

2. Place the insertion point in the table of contents, and press F9 to update
   the table. All heading numbers should now be displayed in the table of
   contents.

3. Press CTRL+SHIFT+F9. This unlinks the table of contents, so that it is no
   longer a field, but ordinary text you can edit.

4. Type the symbols back into the document headings, and the table of contents
   manually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.This problem was corrected in Microsoft
