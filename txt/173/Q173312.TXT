TITLE   :DEC Pathworks 32 7.0 May Cause Windows NT 4.0 to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running either Windows NT 4.0 Server or Windows NT 4.0 Workstation may
randomly stop responding if the DEC Pathworks 32 version 7.0 protocol is also
running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine if Pathworks 32 version 7.0 is causing the system to stop
responding, remove the Pathworks 32 protocol from the system, and then monitor
the system for an appropriate amount of time to see if the system continues to
stop responding.

If the system does not stop after the Pathworks 32 protocol has been removed,
contact DEC and obtain Pathworks 32 Version 7.0a. Several fixes to DECnet have
been incorporated in Pathworks 32 version 7.0a.


Additional query words: DEClat Pathworks32
