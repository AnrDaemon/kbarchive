TITLE   :Can't Open Setup.exe on Learn VB Now CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Press
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the Learn Visual Basic Now program included with the
Microsoft Visual Basic Deluxe Learning Edition, you will receive the following
error message:

   File Not Found.

CAUSE
=====

The Learn Visual Basic Now CD-ROM contains mixed-case filenames, including
Setup.exe. These filenames cannot be read by Microsoft Windows NT 3.5x, or by
Windows 95 computers that use MS-DOS CD-ROM drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact your CD-ROM drive manufacturer to obtain an updated driver for your
CD-ROM drive. For Windows NT 3.5x, the only resolution is to upgrade to
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows NT 3.5x, Windows 3.1, and MS-DOS cannot read CD-ROM filenames
that contain spaces or lowercase letters. However, later versions of Microsoft
Windows, including Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, use updated CD-ROM
drivers to allow spaces, lowercase letters, and long filenames.

Because Windows 95 permits extended CD-ROM filenames, it does not have problems
reading the CD-ROM for this book. However, Windows 95 configurations that use
MS-DOS CD-ROM drivers will not be able to access the extended CD-ROM filenames
on this CD-ROM.
