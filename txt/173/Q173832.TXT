Book Assumes Reader Is Using Microsoft Exchange
-----------------------------------------------

Microsoft Team Manager 97 can be used with any of the following e-mail programs:

 - Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows NT version 3.51 or later

 - Lotus Notes Release 4.1 or later

 - Lotus cc:Mail Release 7.0

 - Lotus cc:Mail Release 2.2 or 6.0

Microsoft Team Manager 97 also allows users to exchange messages using a shared
folder system.

will not work correctly in other environments.

information when it becomes available.
