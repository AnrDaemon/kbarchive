TITLE   :BUG: Error Disassociating Resultset from rdoConnection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000 kbRDO kbVBp kbVBp500 kbVBp500bug kbVBp600 kbVBp600bug kbOSWin95 kbOSWin98 k

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to disassociate a Resultset based on a parameterized rdoQuery object
by setting the Resultset's ActiveConnection property to Nothing will result in
an error:

   Run-Time Error '40070':
   This property or method is not supported when using the currently selected
   cursor library.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Resultset is based on a parameterized rdoQuery
object. It also occurs using the UserConnection object with the same
circumstances.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only workaround is to not use a parameterized rdoQuery object to create a
Resultset.

You can set the Resultset ActiveConnection property to Nothing if:

 - The Resultset is based on a SQL Select statement or a non-parameter rdoQuery,

-and-

 - the CursorDriver is rdUseClientBatch, the type is rdOpenStatic, and the l
   ocktype is rdConcurBatch.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project.

2. Click References on the Project menu, and check Microsoft Remote Data Object
   2.0.

3. Add a Command Button to Form1.

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations of Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim Rs As rdoResultset
            Dim Cn As rdoConnection
            Dim strConnect As String
            Dim Query1 As rdoQuery

            strConnect = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=MyServer;" & _
            "Database=pubs;Uid=sa;Pwd="
            rdoEnvironments(0).CursorDriver = rdUseClientBatch
            Set Cn = rdoEnvironments(0).OpenConnection(dsName:="", _
            Prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, ReadOnly:=False, Connect:=strConnect)

            'To run without error, uncomment the next line and comment the
            'following 2 lines.
            'Set Query1 = Cn.CreateQuery("Query1", _
              "SELECT au_id, au_lname, au_fname FROM authors")
            Set Query1 = Cn.CreateQuery("Query1", _
              "SELECT au_id, au_lname, au_fname FROM authors WHERE au_id = ?")
            Cn.rdoQueries("Query1").rdoParameters(0) = "238-95-7766"

            Set Rs = Cn.rdoQueries("Query1").OpenResultset(rdOpenStatic, _
              rdConcurBatch)
            Set Rs.ActiveConnection = Nothing       ' This causes the error
            Rs.MoveLast
            Rs.MoveFirst
              Do Until Rs.EOF
              Debug.Print Rs(1)
              Rs.MoveNext
            Loop
            Cn.Close
         End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the project. Click Command1. You will receive the
   run-time error '40070' when setting the ActiveConnection to Nothing.
