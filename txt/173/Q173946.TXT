   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

A large number of NNTP pull newsfeeds can create a significant amount of
overhead on your Microsoft Exchange Server computer. This can slow response
times for other operations such as servicing NNTP newsreader clients. If you
have a Microsoft Exchange Server computer configured to support NNTP
newsreaders, and you would like to disable support for pull newsfeeds, create
the following DWORD registry value and set its value to 1:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\
   ParametersSystem\NNTP NewNews Disabled

MORE INFORMATION
================

This can be useful in cases where your computer is freely accessible on your
intranet or the Internet, and you do not want people to pull newsfeeds from your
server.
