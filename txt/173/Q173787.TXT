TITLE   :MDG: Random Error "Sign on ID or Password Incorrect"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail Remote for Windows users receive the following error when attempting to
connect to their postoffice for transmitting mail:

   Postoffice has not accepted mail item.
   Sign-on ID or password is incorrect.

However, the postoffice password has not been changed and a new init-disk has no
affect.

CAUSE
=====

The External instance(s) in the INI file for the modem(s) do not include a path
statement to the postoffice. Therefore, the MTA service a remote user connects
with does not recognize the sign-on ID or password as an existing postoffice.
When the error message occurs randomly and there are multiple instances
servicing Mail Remote users and the modems are in a phone number "Hunt group,"
the instances must be the identical.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, include the path information to the postoffice in the
INI file instance section.
