TITLE   :XADM: No Messages Generated when 2 Clients Modify the Same Rule
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When two Microsoft Exchange Clients update the same rule at the same time, the
last client to commit the change will overwrite the other client's changes. This
is the last writer wins scenario. There is no conflict message generated, and no
events are logged.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design. Folder Associate Information (FAI) messages have
never made allowances for a conflict scenario, the last write will always win.
