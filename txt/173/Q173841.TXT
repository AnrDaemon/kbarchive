SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to perform an unattended installation of the
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Original Resource Kits & Supplements One And Two
------------------------------------------------

To perform an unattended installation of the Resource Kit, execute the following
MS-DOS command from the root directory of the Resource Kit CD- ROM:

   " _setup /q1 " (without the quotation marks)

This will install the Resource Kit files to the default location without
presenting any dialog boxes.

Supplement Three
----------------

These directions are only valid for version 3.03 and later of the Supplement
Three utilities.

PLEASE NOTE: As of August 31, 2000 the Microsoft Press ResourceLink is no longer
available. Therefore, the FULLNTRK.EXE, (i.e. Supplement Three of the Windows NT
Server 4.0 Resource Kit) is no longer available. To perform an unattended
installation of the Resource Kit, you must have downloaded FULLNTRK.EXE from the
Microsoft Press ResourceLink prior to August 31, 2000.

To install the Windows NT Resource Kit utilities, execute the following MS-DOS
command from the directory where you saved FULLNTRK.EXE:

   FULLNTRK.exe /c:"rksetup [path] /q"

where path is the path to the directory where you want to install the Windows NT
Resource Kit (Default = C:/NTRESKIT).

For full instructions on installing an individual component of the Resource Kit
utilities without prompting, please see the Readme.doc file in the README.exe
component of the utilities.

Please note that by performing an unattended installation, you have accepted the
End User License Agreement included with the Resource Kit.
