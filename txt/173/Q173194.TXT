TITLE   :XCLN: Cannot Open Third-Party Applications Attached in Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Macintosh clients are unable to open attachments that require
a third-party application to open them. The attachment is delivered with a
generic icon and when the user tries to open it, the user gets the following
error message:

   File format cannot be read

CAUSE
=====

The file type needs to be defined on the Macintosh workstation whether the
workstation belongs to the sender or to the recipient.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you need to modify the appropriate file associations in
the Exchange Preferences file.

NOTE: To do any of the following, you need a third-party Macintosh application
called ResEdit.

Before attempting the following change, you must know the appropriate file
extension, creator, and type. To get this information, start ResEdit, and on the
File Menu, click Get File/Folder Info, and select one of the files in question.

1. Make a backup copy of the Exchange Preferences file. In the System folder,
   click the Preferences folder, and click the Exchange Preferences file icon.
   From the File menu, click Duplicate. This is just a precautionary measure in
   case using ResEdit causes a problem with your Preferences file.

2. If it's not already running, start ResEdit.

3. Open the Exchange Preferences file.

4. Open the STR # section.

5. Double-click Mac File Types.

6. For every file type, there should be a string entry. To modify a file
   association, simply select the file association you want to edit. To enter a
   new string, on the Resource menu, click Insert New Field. Use the format:

   .ext=:creator:type

7. After the appropriate information has been entered, save the file.

8. When the Exchange Macintosh client is started, the edited or new file
   association is available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To successfully open an attachment that has a generic icon:

1. Save the attached file to the hard disk drive.

2. Start the application.

3. Open the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The creator and type need to be four characters long. Because the type is
usually only three characters, a space needs to be added at the end. For
example:

   Value Name: DAD2:drw2 (this can be case sensitive)
   Data Type: REG_SZ String: .cvs
