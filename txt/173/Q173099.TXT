TITLE   :MTG: OS2 Causes a GP Fault in Async.ovl.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When processing mail with the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT
MMTA) external program, NT MMTA crashes with a system error message:

   OS/2 caused a General Protection Fault in ASYNC.OVL.EXE

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur when the external program encounters a mailbag that
contains a message which is corrupted. This corrupted message could be in an
external postoffice outbound mailbag, directory synchronization mailbag, gateway
mailbag, or the inbound mailbag. When more details are enabled for logging mta
activity, the Session.log may end with an entry similar to the following
example:

   m:\mai\ma.\001.net!agate!biosci!news.stanford..mai error code = 2

Because there is no MAI subdirectory named "MA.", this is the corrupted message
causing the NT MMTA to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

The mailbag containing the corrupted message must be reset or rebuilt. A manual
reset using MS-DOS Debug or the Mailq16 utility can be used to fix the mailbag
files. In some cases, identification of the affected mailbag may not be
possible.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Mailq16.exe utility that ships in the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
Resource Kit to reset or rebuild the KEY and MBG files for the user. Mailq16.exe
is also found on the TechNet CD.

For additional information on how to run Mailq16.exe, please see the following
