   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Welcome splash screen that appears after the initial installation
and after each new user logs on to the computer may be removed if an
administrator wants to prevent users from seeing it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove the Windows NT Welcome splash screen, use one of the following
methods:

Method One
----------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Log on as a new user, and then log off. Log on a second time and click The
   box that says:

      Show this Welcome Screen next time you start Windows NT

2. Run Regedt32. Go to:

      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
      \Explorer\Tips

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

   The contents of the Tips key should look like the following:

      "DisplayInitialTipWindow"=dword:00000000
      "Show"=hex:00,00,00,00
      "Next"=hex:03,00

3. Select the key, and then select Save Key from the Registry menu. Save the key
   as %systemroot%\Profiles\default user\welcome.

4. Open the Ntuser.dat file in Regedt32.exe by doing the following:

   a. Go to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE window and highlight HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

   b. From the Registry menu, select Load Hive. If the option is unavailable,
      log off, and then log on as an administrator.

   c. In the file dialog box, select:

        %Systemroot%\Profiles\Default user\Ntuser.dat

   d. Enter the key name Welcome, or any name not currently in use.

5. Restore the Welcome key previously saved by doing the following:

   a. Select the registry key:

         HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows
         \CurrentVersion\Explorer

      NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

   b. Click Add Key from the Edit menu. Enter Key Name as Tips, and leave Class
      field blank.

6. Select the newly-created Tips, and then select Restore from the Registry
   menu. Select %Systemroot%\Profiles\Default user\welcome" from Step 3 above.

7. On the Registry menu, select Unload Hive.

8. Quit Regedt32.exe.

All new users who log on will not be prompted with the Welcome screen. You can
still start it, however, by clicking Start, clicking Run, and then typing in
Welcome.

Method Two
----------

1. Rename %Systemroot%\System32\Welcome.exe.

NOTE: You can enable the Welcome to Windows NT splash screen again by renaming
Welcome.exe back to Welcome.exe in %Systemroot%, logging off, and then logging
back on.
