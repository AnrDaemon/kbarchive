TITLE   :PRB: MouseMove Events Fires on Disabled Control in VFP
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300 kbvfp300b kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 3.x and 5.x, the MouseMove event fires when you move over a
disabled control. This behavior may confuse some developers because the
MouseMove event does not fire on a disabled control in Visual Basic 5.0 and
Microsoft Access 97.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must write code to determine the status of the Enabled property of the
object and then conditionally perform the MouseMove event method code. The
following code checks if the object's Enabled property is true and if so,
permits your MouseMove method code to conditionally execute.

      IF This.Enabled=.t.
         ThisForm.Command2.Visible=.f.
      ENDIF

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is the desired behavior in Visual FoxPro. Since Visual FoxPro does not
automatically disable the MouseMove event of a disabled object, it offers you
more flexibility in application design. If you want to emulate the behavior
found in Visual Basic or Microsoft Access 97, see the RESOLUTION section above.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form that contains two command buttons.

2. In Command1, set the Enabled property to false (.F.) and add the following
   code to the MouseMove event:

         Thisform.Command2.Visible=.F.

3. Run the form and move the icon over the disabled command button. The
   MouseMove fires and the Command2 object becomes invisible.
