TITLE   :XCLN: Protecting an OST File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is no way to password-protect an offline folder (OST - Offline Folder
Storage - .Ost file), as you can with a .Pst file. Nonetheless, the .Ost file is
safe because it is specific to the particular Exchange user profile. The
Exchange user profile is in the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER and cannot be
accessed without logging on as the proper user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Windows 95, users can customize their preferences and desktop settings.
Windows switches to your personal settings when you log on. This option can be
found by opening Control Panel, double-clicking the Passwords icon, and clicking
the User Profiles tab.

(You can also do this with the Roving Users setup in Windows 95. If the option
"All users of this PC use the same preference and desktop settings" is selected
from the Control Panel, Password, User Profile tab, then Windows defaults to the
default user profile, and there is no protection of the OST file. Any user will
have access to the offline folder.)

Under Windows NT Workstation 3.51 and 4.0, you must log on to either the domain
or the local computer. You are not given a default profile to use. The OST file
is protected through the Windows profile as long as the client is not using the
default user profile. However, if the user does not log on using his or her
Windows username and password, the user will not be able to access his or her
OST file.
