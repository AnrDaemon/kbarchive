KEYWORDS:kbproof winword word97

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, all values in the Word Count dialog box except Pages and
Lines may equal zero, regardless of the content of the document.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you only have an object (such as a picture) selected
when you click Word Count on the Tools menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

Cancel the selection of any object before you click Word Count on the Tools
menu. To do this, click anywhere in the text of the document.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Word Count feature returns the number of words and characters in the current
selection. If nothing is selected, values are returned for the entire document.
However, if a non-text object like a picture is selected, the Word Count returns
zero.

Additional query words: 8.0 8.00
