The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

If you use Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 and save simultaneous item
changes on the same replica of a public folder, a public folder item conflict
notification is generated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you save multiple changes to the same item on a single public folder replica,
an item conflict notification with the contents of both versions of the item is
generated and sent to the owner of the public folder. The owner can then
manually resolve the conflict. In previous versions of Microsoft Exchange
Server, an item conflict notification is only generated if an item change is
simultaneously saved on different replicas of a public folder.

An item conflict notification is sent to both the owner of the public folder and
the mailbox that creates the conflict.
