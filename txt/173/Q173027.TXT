======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an MFC program uses a CRichEditDoc and a CRichEditView is not the first pane
of a splitter window, an access violation occurs when you start the program.

CAUSE
=====

MFC's CRichEditDoc::GetView always assumes the first view of the active frame
window is a CRichEditView. The pointer is returned and used as a CRichEditView
object even though it may not be. The crash occurs when you use a data member or
function specific to CRichEditView.

RESOLUTION
==========

Since GetView is not virtual, it cannot be overriden. When using Visual C++ 4.0
or 4.1, make sure that the first pane is a CRichEditView.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in the Microsoft
Foundation Classes version 4.2 and shipped with Visual C++ version 4.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a CRichEditView is specified during the creation of an MFC program using
AppWizard, a CRichEditDoc derived class is created for the program. When the
rich edit view is initially displayed, the framework calls
CRichEditDoc::SetTitle to update the frame window's title. However, SetTitle
calls GetView, which returns the first view in the view list.
