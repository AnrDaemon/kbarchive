TITLE   :Update.exe Does Not Copy All Windows 3.x Client Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Windows 3.x client Update.exe program included in SNA Server 3.0 Service
Pack 1 does not overwrite the existing SNA Server client files located in the
<winroot>\System directory.

The following SNA Server Windows 3.x client files are copied to the
<winroot>\system directory by the SNA client setup program, but are not
updated when you applying Service Pack 1:

   Appcstr.dll
   Bvcli.dll
   Csvstr.dll
   Ctl3d.dll
   Ehnappc.dll
   Fmistr.dll
   Ipcli.dll
   Lmcli.dll
   Luastr.dll
   Nbcli.dll
   Nwcli.dll
   Snands16.dll
   Toolhelp.dll
   Trnsdt.dll
   Trnsdtj.dll
   Trnsdtk.dll
   Trnsdts.dll
   Trnsdtt.dll
   Wdmod.dll
   Winappc.dll
   Wincpic.dll
   Wincsv.dll
   Winmgt.dll
   Winsli.dll
   Wintrc.dll
   Wlogtr.dll
   Ymgr.dll

Because these files are not updated when Service Pack 1 is applied, problems that
were resolved in the service pack related to the Windows 3.x may continue to
occur after the service pack is applied. If this occurs, check the size and
time/date stamps on these files to verify whether they are the original files
installed with version 3.0 of the Windows 3.x client.

   SNA Windows 3.x client version 3.0
   ----------------------------------

   Time Stamp: 3:00 AM
   Date Stamp: 11/18/96

Note: Taken from the Clients\Win3x\System directory on the SNA Server 3.0 compact
disc.

   SNA Windows 3.x client version 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1)
   -------------------------------------------------------

   Time Stamp: 3:01 AM
   Date Stamp: 4/9/97

NOTE: Taken from the Clients\Win3x\System directory on the SNA Server 3.0 SP1
compact disc.

CAUSE
=====

The UPDATE.INI file that is read by the UPDATE.EXE program incorrectly specifies
!overwrite for the client files that are to be copied into the
<winroot>\system directory. The !overwrite parameter specifies that the
files should not be overwritten if they already exist.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following three workarounds:

 - Manually copy the files listed above from the Client\Win3x\System directory
   on the SP1 compact disc to the <Winroot>\System directory.

   -OR-

1. Copy the Clients\Win3x directories to a hard disk drive and modify the
   Update.ini file to change !overwrite parameter to overwrite for the files
   listed above. These files are listed after the following line in the
   Update.ini file:

   ; Windows System Files

2. Save the changes. To reapply the service pack, run the Update.exe program on
   each of the clients that use the SNA Windows 3.x Client.

   -OR-

 - Install the SNA Windows 3.x client from the SNA Server 3.0 Refresh compact
   disc that includes Service Pack 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the SNA Windows 3.x Client
version 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA
Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
