TITLE   :Print Session Stops Responding When Printing to File
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a print session is configured to print to a file and you have selected the
Monitor Job option, the print session stops responding. The only way to end the
session is to deactivate the Print Server associated with the print session.
This does not occur when printing to a locally attached or network printer.

CAUSE
=====

When the Monitor Job option is selected, the print session waits for
notification from the printer before continuing the print job; printing to a
file does not provide notification.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, when you select both Print To File and Monitor Job, a
message appears stating that Print To File and Monitor Job cannot both be set
appears when you exit the Printing tab. This pop-up message also appears when
you exit the Transparency/GDI page.
