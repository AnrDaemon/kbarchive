KEYWORDS:kbdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you perform a migration from Novell NetWare to Windows NT, the Supervisor
equivalents are not migrated to the Administrators group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The book "Services for NetWare Networks," version 3.5 states in chapter 9, on
page 88:

   You can choose to add groups and users who have Supervisor
   rights to the Administrators group on Windows NT.

This statement is not correct. The users are added to the global Administrators
group instead.

NOTE: Do not confuse the "Services for NetWare Administrators Guide (Add-on
Utilities for Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0)" with the book mentioned
here. There is no information about using the Nwconv.exe migration utility in
this book.

Additional query words: nwconv migrate convert
