TITLE   :Deleting Non-Existent File Causes Event ID 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Event ID 2000 appears occasionally in the event log. The event is described by
the following message:

   The server's call to a system service failed unexpectedly.

The data field (in words) looks like the following example:

   0000: 00040000 00540001 00000000 c00007d0
   0010: 00000000 c000000f 00000000 00000000
   0020: 00000000 00000000 05180bc5

CAUSE
=====

Event ID 2000 is caused by a client trying to delete a non-existent file on a
NetWare server through Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW). This doesn't appear
to cause any problems other than the error message in the Event Log.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
