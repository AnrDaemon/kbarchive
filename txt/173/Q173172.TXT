TITLE   :SNA Manager Not Setting LUA Pool Size to Actual Number of LUs
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the configured LUA pool size is larger than the actual number of LUA LUs in
the LUA pool, the following symptoms can occur:

 - If the Close Listen Socket option is selected, the TN3270 server does not
   close the listening socket after all LUA LUs have been opened. This causes
   new TN3270 client connection attempts to stops responding when all LUs are in
   use.

 - The following Windows NT application event log entries will be logged if the
   TN3270 server attempts to open an LUA Pool when all LUA LUs in the pool have
   already been opened:

   

      Event ID: 1955
      Source:   SNA RUI Application
      Description:
      RUI_INIT failed for LU TN3270, primary_rc=1400, secondary_rc=87000000

      Event ID: 305
      Source:   TN3270 Server
      Description:
      RUI_INIT specifying LU <luname> failed with LUA_UNSUCCESSFUL,
      LUA_COMMAND_COUNT_ERROR

CAUSE
=====

When you assign an LUA Pool to the TN3270 Server in SNA Manager, the LUA Pool
TN3270 folder shows the pool size as 30,000, instead of the actual number of LUA
LUs in the pool. The LUA pool size can be changed manually.

This problem does not occur using SNA Server 2.11, because the TN3270
Administrator program always sets the correct LUA pool size in the TN3270
configuration file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

With this update applied, when an LUA pool is assigned to a TN3270 service, the
session count for the pool is set to the number of LUs in the Pool.

If an LUA LU is added to a pool which is already assigned to TN3270, and the
session count is equal to the number of LUs in the pool, then the session count
is incremented so that it still equals the number of LUs.

If an LUA LU is removed from a pool which is already assigned to TN3270, and the
session count becomes less than the number of LUs in the pool, then the session
count is lowered to equal the number of LUs.

If a user manually sets the session count to some number less than the number of
LUs in the pool, then the count is not automatically changed when LUs are added
or removed from the pool. However if enough LUs are removed so that the session
count becomes equal or greater than the number of LUs in the pool, then the
session count will start to track any further additions or removals.
