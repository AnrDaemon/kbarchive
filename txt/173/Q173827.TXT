-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Project for Windows 95 Step by Step ISBN 1-55615-866-1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open the 14Lesson.mpp or 15Lesson.mpp practice files, the
practice file may not load normally. Instead, you may see a window labeled
"Import" with various options for importing the file into your current project
file.

CAUSE
=====

In order for all of the "Microsoft Project for Windows 95 Step by Step" files to
fit on one floppy disk, 14Lesson.mpp and 15Lesson.mpp were compressed. These
compressed files are not readable by Microsoft Project for Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the Setup program to install these files to the hard disk. In addition to
copying the practice files from the floppy disk to your hard disk, the Setup
program automatically decompresses these two lessons.

For setup instructions, please read pgs. xxiv-xxvi, "Installing the Step by Step
Practice Files."
