TITLE   :SMSINST: Office 97 Does Not Show Template Icons
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click New on the File menu in Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, or
Microsoft Excel, a template dialog box is displayed, which does not show the
icons for the templates. However, if you click in the template dialog box you
will see the preview for the template.


CAUSE
=====

When you repackage Office 97, Systems Management Server Installer sets an
environment variable incorrectly and causes the registry entries to be
incorrect. For example, see the value in the following registry key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common
   \FileNew\LocalTemplates

   C:\\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates

The path is incorrect because of the double backslash.

WORKAROUND
==========

Edit the script and find the block:

      Set variable MAINDIR to
      If System Has Windows 95 Shell Interface Start Block
         Get Registry....
         Get Registry ...
         Set Variable MAINDIR to C:\%MAINDIR%

Change the text to:

      Set Variable MAINDIR to C:%MAINDIR%

Removing this extra backslash and then recompiling fixes the problem. Note there
can be other directories before the MAINDIR variable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
