SUMMARY
=======

When setting the Internet Transfer Control URL, Username, and Password
properties programmatically, the order in which you do it is very important. If
you don't set the URL property before the Username and Password properties, you
will get the following error:

   Run-time error '35754'
   Unable to connect to remote host

IMPORTANT: In the control shipped with Visual Basic 5.0 (not the Service Packs),
the Username is sent as Anonymous if the URL property is not set first
(regardless of the UserName and Password properties). So when connecting to an
FTP server, you would be accessing the URL with the Anonymous credentials, not
with the credentials you intended (according Username and Password Inet
properties).

NOTE: The Internet Transfer Control included with Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2
is unable to make an authenticated connection using the Username and Password
properties. For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q173265 : BUG: Internet Transfer Control (SP2) Username and Password

Workaround
----------

This is sample code for setting the URL property before the Username and Password
properties so you won't get the error described above: Inet1.URL =
"ftp://YourFTPServer" Inet1.UserName = "Username" Inet1.Password = "Password"
Notice the URL property is set before the Username and Password properties. Do
not specify the URL again in the execute method.

This information is also documented in the Visual Basic 5.0 Readme file.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is added by default.

2. From the Project menu, click Components and select the Internet Transfer
   Control 5.0 into the project if it is not already loaded.

3. Place an Internet Transfer Control 5.0 (Inet1) on Form1 and add the following
   code:

         Private Sub Inet1_StateChanged(ByVal State As Integer)
          Dim vtData As Variant ' Data variable.

          Select Case State
          ' ... Other cases not shown.
          Case icError ' 11
              ' In case of error, return ResponseCode and

         ' ResponseInfo.
              vtData = Inet1.ResponseCode & ":" & _
              Inet1.ResponseInfo

          Case icResponseCompleted  ' 12
              Dim strData As String: strData = ""
              Dim bDone As Boolean: bDone = False

              ' Get first chunk.
              vtData = Inet1.GetChunk(1024, icString)
              DoEvents

              Do While Not bDone

                  strData = strData & vtData
                  ' Get next chunk.
                  vtData = Inet1.GetChunk(1024, icString)
                  DoEvents

                  If Len(vtData) = 0 Then
                      bDone = True
                  End If
              Loop

             MsgBox strData
          End Select
         End Sub

4. Place a CommandButton (Command1) on Form1 and add the following code:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
             Inet1.UserName = "Username"
             Inet1.Password = "Password"
             Inet1.URL = "ftp://YourFTPServer"
             Inet1.Execute , "DIR"
        End Sub

5. From the Run menu, click Start (ALT, R, S) or press the F5 key to run the
   program. Click the Command1 button, and you will see error described above.
