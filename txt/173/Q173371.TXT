TITLE   :XWEB: Outlook Web Access Doesn't Show Subject-Line Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access Microsoft Exchange Server with Outlook Web Access (OWA), a space
at the beginning of a subject line will not be displayed. For example, if you
receive a message with the Subject " meeting", Outlook Web Access displays the
Subject as "meeting". This occurs regardless of the number of spaces at the
beginning of the subject line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
