PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbui word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Word 97 as your e-mail editor and click a button on the Formatting
toolbar, the Find and Replace dialog box may lose focus.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you are using Word as your e-mail editor and want to find or replace
formatting in a mail message, you must use the Format menu in the Find and
Replace dialog box, and not the buttons on the Formatting toolbar.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally in Word 97, you can click the buttons on the Formatting toolbar to set
criteria for the Find and Replace dialog box. That is, you can click the Bold,
Italic, Underline, or paragraph alignment buttons, or select something from the
Style, Font, or Font Size lists to enter information under the Find What or
Replace With criteria. However, this feature is not available if you use Word as
the editor in an e-mail program, such as Microsoft Outlook.
