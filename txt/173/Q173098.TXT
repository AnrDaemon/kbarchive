SYMPTOMS
========


After you install System 8 for Macintosh, the MacMail client for PC Networks
Compose note screen buttons do not work. Only the To button still works. When
you attempt to use the CC, Subject, Attach, Priority, or Send buttons, they do
not respond but cause the To button to respond without running.

==========

To work around this problem, use the Compose drop down menu selection or the hot
keys as they are not affected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Macintosh client
for PC Networks version 3.5x. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
