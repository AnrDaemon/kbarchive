registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set Word to scroll smoothly through your document
when you drag the vertical scroll bar.

NOTE: In large documents, you may not be able to scroll as smoothly through your
document when using this Registry option.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word 97 has an undocumented Registry setting that will allow you to
actively scroll through your document when you drag the vertical scroll bar.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

1. Quit Word.

2. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

3. In the Open box, type RegEdit, and then click OK.

4. In the registry, step down to the following key:

       HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Options

5. Click to select the Options key.

6. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click String Value.

7. Type "LiveScrolling" (without the quotation marks) for the new string value
   name, and press ENTER.

8. Click to select your new "LiveScrolling" string value, if it is not already
   selected.

9. On the Edit menu, click Modify.

10. In the Value data box, type "1" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

11. On the Registry menu, click Exit.

NOTE: There isn't a user interface through the menus or through the RegOptions
macro to add this undocumented setting in Word. You must manually edit the
Windows Registry.

For more information about the RegOptions macro, click the Office Assistant, type
"What is the RegOptions macro?," click Search, click "Supplied Macros," and then
click to view "Support8.dot."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
