The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows NT Setup, you may receive any of the following error
messages:

    - ERROR: Setup was unable to install the Boot Loader

    - ERROR: The partition you have chosen is not recognized by Windows NT

    - Setup was unable to install Windows NT Boot Loader.

   Ensure that your C: drive is formatted and that
   the drive is not damaged.

   Setup cannot continue. Press ENTER to exit.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Setup does not support the FAT32 file system included with Windows 95
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) or Windows 98.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install Windows NT 4.0, make sure that both your boot partition and the
partition you are installing to is either formatted with the FAT16 or NTFS file
system, or not formatted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FAT32 file system is a new file system option included with OSR2. OSR2
provides support for logical drives larger than 2 gigabytes (GB). Enabling large
disk support using the FAT32 file system is not supported by MS-DOS, the retail
version of Windows 95, or Windows NT.

NOTE: Windows NT Setup does not create or delete FAT32 partitions. Before
deleting a partition, back up your data.

4.0 Setup, see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
