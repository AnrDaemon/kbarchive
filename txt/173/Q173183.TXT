SUMMARY
=======

The Grpcpy.doc file, which is included with the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource
Kit, Supplement Two, cannot be read if you use WordPad to open it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Grpcpy.doc was saved in Microsoft Word 95 format before the tracked editing
changes were accepted. The document still contains both the deleted text (which
appears in strikethrough format) and the inserted text (which appears in
underlined format). WordPad does not support tracked editing changes, and it
cannot distinguish between deleted text and inserted text.

Use one of the following methods to make the document easier to read.

 - Open Grpcpy.doc in Microsoft Word 95 or later, accept the editing changes,
   and then save the document. For more information on tracking editing changes,
   see the Microsoft Word documentation or Help.

   -or-

 - Open Grpcpy.doc in WordPad, and then manually delete the text that appears in
   strikethrough format.
