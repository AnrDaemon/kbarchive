SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, Ntbackup.exe can read tapes created by third-party tape backup
utilities. This can be useful in situations in which the third-party backup
software is not readily available for some reason, such as when a computer has
been rebuilt. For Ntbackup.exe to read the tape successfully, the software used
to create the tape must support the Microsoft tape format (MTF), and it must not
compress the data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible that Ntbackup.exe may not be able to read a catalog of files
written on a tape by third-party backup software, because the on-tape catalog
(OTC) is not present or is not compatible with Ntbackup.exe. In this case, the
tape will not be recognized as part of a set. To resolve this part of the
problem, Ntbackup.exe needs to be started with the /missingtape command line
switch, using the steps below:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type the following command and then press ENTER:

   Ntbackup /missingtape

The /missingtape switch allows the tape to be read as an individual tape (as
opposed to being part of a set), which will allow Ntbackup.exe to catalog the
tape. After the tape is catalogued, files on it will become accessible.

In addition, tapes created in one manufacturer's tape drive may not be compatible
with another manufacturer's tape drive. If this is the case, you will not be
able to continue without the third-party software or an identical tape drive.
