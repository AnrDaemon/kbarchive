TITLE   :SMS: PCM Does Not Run Mandatory Jobs in Date/Time Order
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When several mandatory jobs are queued up and due at a certain time (for
example, at 9:30 A.M.) and a user logs on to the Windows NT Workstation computer
at a later time (suppose 9:45 A.M.), PCMWIN32 runs the jobs correctly, but it
does not take the jobs in order of mandatory time. The same behavior affects
PCMSVC32 when a server or a workstation is turned on after the mandatory date
and time.

All versions of the Package Command Manager (PCM, which includes PCMDOS,
PCMWIN16, PCMWIN32, and PCMSVC32) are affected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
