TITLE   :XWEB: Read Next Message Command Fails after Move/Copy
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When accessing Microsoft Exchange Server with Outlook Web Access (OWA), you may
see odd behavior when choosing to view the next message after a move message
operation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an opened messaged is moved to another folder and the Read Next Item command
is selected, OWA will skip the next message and move on to the third message in
the folder. If there is no third message, you will receive the following error
message:

   There are no more messages in that direction.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange OWA, version
5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
