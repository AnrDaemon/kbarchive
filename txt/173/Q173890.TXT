PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 with Outlook Web Access (OWA),
canceling an appointment or meeting will cause the Paper Clip icon for an
attachment to show on the Attachment tab of the Cancellation form, even though
there was no attachment in the original meeting notice.

WORKAROUND
==========

Clicking on the Attachment tab causes the Paper Clip icon to disappear. This has
no effect on the cancellation of the appointment.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
