SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

The Microsoft Exchange Resource Kit includes an extension called the Server Space
Client Extension Tool. The Microsoft Exchange Server Tools Help file contains
incorrect instructions for installing this extension for a Microsoft Exchange
client running on the Windows 95 platform. The instructions also imply that a
16-bit version of the extension is available, which is incorrect. This extension
is only available for 32-bit clients running on Windows 95 or Windows NT
platforms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Use the following steps to correctly install the Server Space Client Extension
Tool for Windows 95 clients:

Installation for Windows 95 Clients
-----------------------------------

1. From the Exchange\Win95\Client\Srvspace directory on the Microsoft BackOffice
   Resource Kit: Part Two CD, copy Spcext32.dll to the Exchange directory on
   your computer.

2. Start the Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and select the following registry
   key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

3. On the Edit menu, select New, and then select String Value.

4. Enter the following string for the Value name:

   " Server Space " (without the quotation marks)

5. On the Edit menu, select Modify and enter the following string into the Value
   data field:

   " 4.0;<drive>:\<path>\spcext32.dll;1;01010000000000 " (without
   the quotation marks)

   ...where <drive> and <path> are the drive letter and directory to
   which Spcext32.dll was copied. As an example, assume that the file is located
   in the C:\Exchange directory. This entry would appear as follows:

      4.0;c:\exchange\spcext32.dll;1;01010000000000

6. Close the Registry Editor.

7. Restart the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client.

Using the Server Space Client Extension Tool
--------------------------------------------

To use the extension, select the Server Space option from the Tools menu. A
Mailbox Server Space dialog box will be displayed with the following text:

   Mailbox - <user name> 20,540KB
   Personal Folders N/A
   Public Folders N/A

The values for Personal Folders and Public Folders will always be displayed as
N/A because the extension does not calculate totals for these folders.
