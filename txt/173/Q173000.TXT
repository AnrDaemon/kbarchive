TITLE   :Moving Files on Macintosh Volume Causes Stop 0x0000001E
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run or start Services for Macintosh (SFM) on a computer running Windows
NT Server and Cheyenne's InocuLAN version 4.0 is installed, the following stop
screen message may occur when you move files on the Macintosh volume:

   STOP: 0x0000001E
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

CAUSE
=====

When the driver INO_FLTR.SYS is present on the computer running Windwos NT
Server, InocuLAN tracks files that are copied or moved on a Macintosh volume.
This symptom can occur if either users or applications move files (that is, mail
clients or a mail gateway).

RESOLUTION
==========

Cheyenne is aware of this problem and has a patch for it. Contact Cheyenne
software for more information about the patch.


-or-

Remove InocuLAN from the server completely. When you disable the four services
and restart the computer, the INO_FLPY.SYS and INO_FLTR.SYS drivers will still
be loaded into memory. The files must be removed from the server completely to
stop them from loading.

MORE INFORMATION
================

InocuLAN is manufactured by Cheyenne, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
