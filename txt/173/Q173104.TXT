TITLE   :XCLN: No MAPI or Programmable APIs for Macintosh Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client is not extensible via custom coding
through Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI), Common Messaging
Calls (CMCs), or any other APIs on the Macintosh platform.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is due to the design of the Exchange Macintosh client, which is not
programmable in a MAPI or CMC sense. The only support available includes a
response to the Apple OpenDocument event (open a new message with the document
provided as a file attachment) and a GURL mailto or news AppleEvent. For more
information about these, see Apple documentation.

MAPI calls are specific to the Windows platform and make function calls to the
Mapi.dll and Mapi32.dll files. These files are not used on the Macintosh
platform, therefore MAPI programming is not possible on the Macintosh.

Microsoft does not document or support any MAPI or CMC calls for the Macintosh
platform. In addition, Microsoft does not have a version of Visual Basic for the
Macintosh platform.
