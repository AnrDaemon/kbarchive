-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Open dialog box (on the File menu, click Open) in Microsoft Word 97, you
can select "Outlook Address Book (*.olk)" in the Files Of Type list. However,
Microsoft Outlook does not create files with that file name extension, so there
are no files to open.

CAUSE
=====

Outlook does not create a separate .olk file to store addresses.

WORKAROUND
==========

To access an Outlook address book in Word, use either of the following methods.

Export the Address Book from Outlook
------------------------------------

To export the addresses from Outlook, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Import And Export.

2. In the Import and Export Wizard dialog box, click to select Export To A File
   and then click Next.

3. Click to select the folder you want to export from (for example, select the
   Contacts folder), and then click Next.

4. In the "Create a file of type" list, click to select either "Comma Separated
   Values (Windows)" or "Tab Separated Values (Windows)," and then click Next.

5. Type a name for the new file in the Save Exported File As box, and click
   Next.

6. Click Map Custom Fields. Select the default map, and then click OK.

7. Click Finish.

After Outlook creates the .csv or .tsv file, you can open the file in Word.
