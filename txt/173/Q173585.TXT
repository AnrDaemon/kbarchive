======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a color PostScript printer, you may experience either of the
following symptoms:

 - General protection (GP) faults in Pscript.drv.

 - Image Color Matching (ICM) does not function.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Adobe Type Manager version 3.01 or earlier is
installed on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "win.ini" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. Add the following line to the [Pscript.drv] section of the file:

   ATMWorkaround=1

4. Save the file, and then quit Notepad.

5. Restart Windows normally.

Or, you can contact Adobe for information about upgrading your version of Type
Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Type Manager version 3.01 and earlier does not support some of the fields that
Windows 95 ICM expects. If these fields are empty, one of the symptoms listed
above may occur.

With the "ATMWorkaround=1" entry in the Win.ini file, ICM does not function
during text output from any program. Remove this line if you install an updated
version of Type Manager.
