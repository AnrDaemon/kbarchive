TITLE   :WD97: Borders Applied to More Lines in Selection Than Expected
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply an inside border to several lines of selected text, extra borders
may be applied. When you apply any of the following borders to a paragraph, a
few lines above or below the text will be formatted with the inside borders.

The borders that exhibit this problem are:

 - Outside Border

 - Top Border

 - Bottom Border

 - Left Border

 - Right Border

 - All Borders

WORKAROUND
==========

When you apply borders to paragraphs above or below a paragraph formatted with
inside borders, select the entire paragraph instead of just placing the
insertion point in the paragraph prior to applying the desired border.

The "More Information" section of this article demonstrates this more clearly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Consider the following example:

In Word, if you type the following text, select paragraphs two and three and then
apply an inside border, the result resembles the following:

    One
 ___Two_________________________________________________________
    Three
    Four

If you then position the insertion point after the "r" in "Four" and apply a
bottom border, you would expect the following result:

    One
 ___Two_________________________________________________________
    Three
 ___Four________________________________________________________

However, an extra border is applied to line three, creating the following
effect:

    One
 ___Two_________________________________________________________
 ___Three_______________________________________________________
 ___Four________________________________________________________

The problem occurs with the border types listed in the "Symptoms" section of this
article. If there are more than one or two paragraphs between the different
border types, the borders are applied as expected.

To correct this problem, select line "Four" rather than placing the insertion
point on the line prior to applying the borders. The borders will then be
applied correctly (leaving line "Three" without a border).
