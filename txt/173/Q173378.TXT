SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a style that contains a numbered list and left indentation, and
then you restart numbering for another list, Word removes the left indentation
from the numbered lists and from the style definition.


WORKAROUND
==========

To restart numbering for another list and have Word preserve the left
indentation for the lists, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Create a Custom Style
-------------------------------

1. Select a numbered list that is indented correctly, as you want it.

2. On the Format menu, click Style.

3. In the Style dialog box, click New.

4. In the Name box, type a new style name.

5. Click to select the "Add to template" box.

6. Click Modify and then click Numbering in the list.

7. Click Customize. Set the indent from the left, or ensure that the indent is
   set correctly. (For example: Left indent set to .5".)

8. Ensure that the "Text indent" setting is also set correctly. (For example:
   Text indent set to .75".)

9. Click OK.

10. Click Apply.

The indentation will remain in all the numbered lists that are based on this
style, even when you restart numbering.

Method 2: Restart the Numbered List
-----------------------------------

To restart the numbering of a list, follow these steps:

1. Press ENTER twice at the end of the first list.

2. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering, and then click the Numbered
   tab.

3. Click to select the numbering scheme that you want, and then click to select
   Restart Numbering.

4. Click OK.

NOTE: After applying the list numbering, you can remove the empty paragraphs
between the numbered lists without affecting the numbering scheme.
