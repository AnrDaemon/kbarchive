SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open another user's schedule, the following error message is
displayed:

   The schedule file could not be opened. A message service provider
   reported an error.

CAUSE
=====

Replication may not have been correctly set up between the two involved sites.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to
set up directory replication between the involved sites.

NOTE: Setting up custom recipients for the user of another site is not sufficient
to open a cross-site schedule. A network connection must exist between the two
computers where the schedules reside.
