TITLE   :XADM: Client Fails to Connect to Alternate PF Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Using a Microsoft Exchange Client, you can open a Public Folder (PF) and
successfully view its contents. However, when you attempt to post a message to
this same PF, you receive the following message:

   The contents of this public folder are currently unavailable. Either the
   Microsoft Exchange Server computer servicing this public folder is down
   or the public folder has not been replicated to this site. See your
   Administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Microsoft Exchange Server that originally
hosted the PF for you shuts down. When you attempt to post a message to the PF,
the Exchange Client will attempt to make an RPC connection to this PF Server and
fail. Even though other Exchange Servers in the Site contain replicas of this
PF, the Exchange Client will not attempt to connect to these Exchange Servers to
complete this task.

STATUS
======

This is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

If this original PF Server remains shut down, you will need to log out and log
in again to connect to a different PF Server. During the login process, the
Exchange Client will realize that the preferred instance is not available and
make an alternative connection to a different PF Server.
