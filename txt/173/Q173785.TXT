TITLE   :SMS: RService Does Not Stop a Service Before an Uninstall
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Rservice to uninstall a service on a system that has that service
running, Rservice does not attempt to stop the service before attempting to
uninstall it. This disables the service on the remote system since it has only
been partially uninstalled. The files that were in use by the service are not
deleted.

CAUSE
=====

Rservice cannot uninstall files that are being used because the service is still
running.

WORKAROUND
==========

Prior to running Rservice with the /DEINSTALL switch, first run it with a /STOP
switch to ensure that the service is stopped on all of the remote systems.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
