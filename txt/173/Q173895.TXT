SUMMARY
=======

Running the migration process on an Intel processor may be considerably faster
than running on a non-Intel CPU such as the DEC Alpha, even though the DEC Alpha
may be a faster CPU.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During Lotus cc:Mail and Novell GroupWise migration, 16-bit code is run as part
of the extraction phase of the migration process. Running extractors on RISC
platform computers results in significantly slower migration performance due to
16-bit code running Intel x86 emulation mode. Performance for the import phase
of the migration process is not affected. For maximum performance, run the
migration extraction phase for Lotus cc:Mail and Novell GroupWise on a computer
with an Intel processor.
