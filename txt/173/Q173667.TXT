-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.5, 2.51, 2.52, 2.6, 5.0, 5.1 
 - Microsoft Windows CE versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.12, 3.0 Professional Edition for the Handheld PC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot send or receive e-mail on MSN, The Microsoft Network, using a
Handheld PC (H/PC) running Microsoft Windows CE.

CAUSE
=====

The MSN e-mail servers use secure authentication to encrypt messages that are
sent and received by an e-mail client. Windows CE includes an e-mail client that
does not use secure authentication and therefore cannot send or receive e-mail
through the MSN e-mail servers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, you can configure a Hot Mail account to send and
receive messages from an MSN e-mail account using Pocket Internet Explorer. Go
to:
