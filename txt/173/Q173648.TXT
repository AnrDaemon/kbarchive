SUMMARY
=======

One way to set up a connection to Oracle and modify the data is by using the
Microsoft Data Bound Grid. The steps listed below allow the user to accomplish
this task. This example uses a DSN-less connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic.

2. On the Project menu, click Components and select "Microsoft Data Bound Grid
   Control." Also, click "Microsoft RemoteData Control 2.0." (NOTE: This adds
   two new icons to the toolbar for the RemoteData Control and DBGrid.)

3. On the Project menu, click References, and click "Microsoft Remote Data
   Object 2.0."

4. Place a DBGrid, RemoteData Control, and a command button on the form.

5. Select the DBGrid, and set the DataSource property to "MSRDC1", which is the
   default name of the RemoteData Control. Also ensure the AllowUpdate property
   is True (default), and if adding new records set AllowAddNew property to True
   (default is False).

6. Add the following code to the click event of the command button:

         Dim myenv as rdoEnvironment
         Dim mycn as rdoConnection
         Dim mydsnless as String
         Dim mysql as String

         mydsnless = "driver={Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle};" _
            "Uid=pss; Pwd=pss;ConnectString=tns:ncoracle73;" _

         Set myenv = rdoEnvironments(0)
         Set mycn = myenv.OpenConnection("",false,rdDriverPrompt,mydsnless)

         mysql = "Select * from demo.customer"

         Set Form1.MSRDC1.Resultset = mycn.OpenResultset(mysql,rdOpenKeyset, _
             rdConcurRowVer)

         Debug.Print mycn.Connect  ' Display the connection string

7. Run the form, change a value in the Grid, and move off the row to update.

In the steps above, the driver being used is the Microsoft Oracle driver. You
need to modify Uid, Pwd, and ConnectString to fit your ODBC setup.
