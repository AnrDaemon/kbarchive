TITLE   :XADM: Renaming the Inbox Produces Unexpected Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Microsoft Exchange Client, you may notice unexpected results
if you rename your Inbox while an IMAP client is also connected to the same
mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

Specific components within Exchange Server were not designed to catch the name
change while an IMAP and Exchange Client were connected to the Inbox
concurrently.

STATUS
======

At the present time, this is not considered destabilizing so no changes to
Exchange Server will be made. Additional information will be posted here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this behavior, follow these steps:

1. Log on to your mailbox with an Exchange Client and an IMAP client at the same
   time.

2. Using Exchange Client, create a subfolder under the Inbox called "test."
   Observe the result in the IMAP client; "Inbox/test" should appear.

3. Using Exchange Client, rename "Inbox" to "newinbox.". Observe the result
   again in the IMAP client; "newinbox/test" will now appear instead of
   "Inbox/test".

4. Close your IMAP client and then reopen it. "Inbox/test" now appears instead
   of "newinbox/test".
