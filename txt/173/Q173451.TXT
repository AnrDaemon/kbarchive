OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When accessing Microsoft Exchange Server using Outlook Web Access (OWA), an
attempt from an Anonymous user to access a Public Folder (PF) that it does not
have permissions to will return the error:

   Failed to get Inbox.

The following error may also be returned:

   You do not have permissions to view this folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This does not effect Microsoft Exchange Server functionality because the
Anonymous user does not have access to the PF.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
