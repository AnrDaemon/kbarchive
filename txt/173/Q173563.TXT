OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Bookshelf 98 requires the Arial and Symbol system fonts to display information
properly. However, if these fonts are not installed on your computer when you
install Bookshelf 98, Bookshelf does not install the fonts.

NOTE: This problem has been resolved in Microsoft Bookshelf 99 and Microsoft
Bookshelf 2000.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reinstall Microsoft Windows to restore the missing system
fonts. To do this:

1. Insert the Windows CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down the
   SHIFT key when you insert the Windows CD-ROM to prevent the Windows CD-ROM
   from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

   <drive>:\setup

   where <drive> is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen. If you are prompted to choose between
   "Copy all Windows files again" or "Restore Windows files that are changed or
   corrupted," click "Restore Windows files that are changed or corrupted."

You can also manually extract the missing system font files directly from the
Windows CD-ROM. For instructions about how to accomplish this task, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
