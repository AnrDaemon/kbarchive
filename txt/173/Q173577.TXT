TITLE   :WD97: Some View Options Change Between Views

KEYWORDS:winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you switch between views, the following view options may change their
current settings:

 - Horizontal Scroll Bar

 - Wrap to Window

CAUSE
=====

The Horizontal Scroll Bar and Wrap To Window settings in online layout view are
independent of the same settings in normal, page layout, outline and master
document views.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. Online layout view optimizes the layout of your
document to make it easier to read online. The text appears larger than it would
be printed, and also wraps to fit the window. To switch to online layout view,
click Online Layout on the View menu.

Horizontal Scroll Bar
---------------------

The horizontal scroll bar option is turned off by default because Word
automatically sizes the document to optimize the amount of text shown with the
Document Map. When you turn this option on, it has no effect on the appearance
of the document.

Wrap to Window
--------------

The Wrap to Window option is turned off by default because the width of the text
is automatically sized based on the width of the document window in online
layout view. When you turn this option on, your document may appear slightly
different because the space around the document is hidden.

What View Options Are Available?
--------------------------------

The following table shows the view options that are available in each view, and
which options stay the same when you switch between views.

Legend:

A = This option is available in this view.
