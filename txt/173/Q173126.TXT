======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro or procedure to
modify the LeftMargin and FirstMargin properties of the RulerLevel class, some
values that are assigned to these properties produce unexpected results.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the LeftMargin and FirstMargin properties allow you
to assign invalid values to the properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are five RulerLevel classes, each of which corresponds to a possible
indent level. The FirstMargin and LeftMargin values of RulerLevel 1 have a valid
range of (-9.0 to 4,095.0). The valid range of values for the FirstMargin and
LeftMargin properties for RulerLevel classes 2 through 4 are described as
follows.

For each RulerLevel L in the set {2, 3, 4, 5}, the following equations describe
the minimum value for the FirstMargin and LeftMargin properties:

      Min(RulerLevel(L).FirstMargin) = Max(RulerLevel(L-1).FirstMargin,
    
                                           RulerLevel(L-1).LeftMargin) + 9
    
      Min(RulerLevel(L).LeftMargin) = Max(RulerLevel(L-1).FirstMargin,
    
                                          RulerLevel(L-1).LeftMargin) + 9

If you assign a value that is between 4,096 and 8,182 to the FirstMargin or
LeftMargin property, a sign bit is switched. The resulting values range from
-4,096 to -10; these values are invalid. Assigning values that range from 8,183
to 8,191 results in values that range from -9 to -1; these values are valid.
