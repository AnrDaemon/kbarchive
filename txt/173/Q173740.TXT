======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you open the OLE-DB documentation contained within Visual C++ 5.0, none of
the diagrams are visible. Instead, you see a black square where the diagram
should be located.

For example, observe the diagram at the bottom of the help topic located in the
following path in the docs:

   + Platform SDK and DDK documentation
   + OLE DB Programmer's Reference documentation
      + OLE DB Programmer's Reference
         + Part One - Introduction to OLE DB
            +  Chapter 2 - Enumerators, Data Sources and Objects
              +  Data Source Objects
                +  Data Source Object states

This error is caused by the OLE-DB 1.1 Specification source files conversion into
the format used by Visual C++.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OLE-DB 1.1 Specification is available through several other mechanisms where
the diagrams appear correctly. The first is the file OLEDB11SPEC.HLP that ships
with the OLE-DB 1.1 SDK.

The second is a hard copy of the same material available from Microsoft Press:

   Microsoft OLE-DB 1.1 Programmer's Reference and Software Development Kit

   ISBN 1-57231-6128-8

The help file and the Microsoft Press volume contain the same content as the
Visual C++ version, only without the black squares.
