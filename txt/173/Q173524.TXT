TITLE   :WINS Pull Partner Start Time Cannot Be Cleared
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you clear the Start Time value for one or more WINS pull partners, the
Start Time will still appear the next time you go into the Pull Partner
Properties dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

To clear the Start Time from your pull partner parameters, edit the registry
using the following steps:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following subkey, where <IP address> is the IP address of
   your pull partner:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \Wins\Partners\Pull\<IP address>

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Double-click SpTime, then delete the value from the String Editor dialog box.

4. Click OK, then exit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
