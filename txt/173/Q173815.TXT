TITLE   :Open File Is Slow When Using Novell IntranetWare Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Opening files off a Novell file server using the Novell IntraNetWare client
takes a long time. This does not happen when Microsoft client for Novell is used
instead of Novell IntraNetWare client.

CAUSE
=====

The delay experienced by the user when using the Novell IntraNetWare client is
caused by the Novell provided DLL (Novnpnt.dll). The Novell provided DLL doesn't
export the entry point NPGetConnectionPerformance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This was a new entry point added in Windows 95 and Windows NT version 4.0 to
implement the MultinetGetConnectionPerformance API. Microsoft Version of Novell
redirector provided (Nwprovau.dll) does export that entry point. As a result,
when MPR calls this entry point, it succeeds quickly.

Because the Novell provided DLL (Novnpnt.dll) does not provide this entry point,
MPR skips it and calls the next provider in the order that, in most cases, is
the server message block provider DLL (ntlanman.dll), which takes a long time to
fail.
