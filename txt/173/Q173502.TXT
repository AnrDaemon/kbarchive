The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you receive an e-mail message using your MSN account, the message is stored
on MSN servers for a specific amount of time, depending on whether you have Post
Office Protocol (POP3) e-mail or Web-based e-mail (HTTP).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you receive POP3 e-mail via your MSN Internet Access e-mail account, then
when a POP3 e-mail message is sent to your e-mail address, the message is stored
on the MSN server until one of the following conditions is met:

 - You log in to your MSN e-mail account. When you log in to your MSN e-mail
   account, messages on the server are forwarded to and stored on your computer.

 - 30 days have passed since the e-mail message was received by the MSN server.
   When an e-mail message has been stored on the server for over 30 days, the
   message is deleted to free disk space and improve performance.

Note: If you use MSN version 5.6 or earlier, you are using POP3 e-mail. If you
receive your e-mail in MSN Explorer, your MSN Internet Access e-mail is
Web-based.

If you have Web-based e-mail, messages may be deleted by MSN from your account
for the following reason:

 - You exceeded the size limit for your e-mail account. MSN Internet Access
   subscribers have a 10 MB size limit for e-mail accounts.

Note: MSN Explorer users who use Internet Service providers (ISPs) other than MSN
Internet Access have a 2MB size limit for the e-mail accounts they access with
MSN Explorer.
