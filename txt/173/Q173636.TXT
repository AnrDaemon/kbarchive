The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an Internet browser client to access an Exchange Server by
means of Outlook Web Access, you cannot open multiple browser windows to view
multiple mailboxes simultaneously. Doing so will result in "Failed to Get Inbox"
error messages for the first mailbox opened.
