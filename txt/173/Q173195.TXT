TITLE   :XCLN: Mac Client Shows No Insertion Point in Editable Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


In Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, sometimes no insertion point shows when
you click in any of the editable fields, for example, the To field or the
message body.

CAUSE
=====

This is a System/Hardware issue. Some older Macintosh computers have 512 KB of
video memory or less, and the new applications and Operating System components
use a large amount of video memory for displays above 640 x 480 pixels.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the monitor resolution to 640 x 480 pixels. This resolution may not work
for all Macintosh client computers that are experiencing this problem but should
correct most of them. Also make certain the computers are running the latest
version of the Exchange Macintosh client.
