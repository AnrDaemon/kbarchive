TITLE   :Multihomed Agent Sends SNMP Trap with Incorrect IP Source
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbSDKPlatform kbSNMP kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When your multihomed Windows NT computer sends Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) traps, the IP address of the first interface is included as the
originating host in the Agent ID field of the Trap Protocol Data Unit (PDU),
even though the SNMP traps are being sent to the network on a different
interface.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Trap PDU is issued by an SNMP entity on behalf of a network management agent
application. It is used to notify the management station of a significant event.
The Agent ID field is included in the Trap PDU, and it should contain the IP
address of the object generating the trap.
