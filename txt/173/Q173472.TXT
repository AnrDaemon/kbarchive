Subscriptions

Microsoft offers subscriptions to Trip Planner. You can receive annual
updates as soon as they become available, making it easier to stay current
with all your travel plans. Please open the Help Contents page to see a
link to subscription information.

Setup Issues

Trip Planner 98 is designed to work with Internet Explorer 3.02. The
Setup program installs Internet Explorer automatically if it determines
that an installation or upgrade of the browser is required. The Internet
Explorer installed by Setup will not take over as your default Web
browser, nor will it affect your browser settings; it is only used to
display articles in the product. Setup may display a "Yes/No" dialog
advising you that it detected a compatible version and will not need to
upgrade. Otherwise, it displays an "OK/Cancel" dialog asking you to
confirm the browser installation.

Setting up Trip Planner 98 may take a few moments longer than other
applications, as numerous fonts and other files need to be installed to
optimize your map display. Do not exit out of Setup when the "Setup is
updating your system" message is displayed; this process is completed on
its own.

If you get an error message during Setup stating "Cannot establish DDE
communication with the desktop," please close Control Panel. You can then
proceed with Setup.

When Setup is installing Internet Explorer you may seen warning messages
about a newer file already being present on your system. This means that
you have a more up-to-date file than the one being copied by the Internet
Explorer setup application. You should answer "Yes" to these messages and
keep the existing file.

Setup installs system files that might be shared with other applications.
You should shut down other applications before running Setup.

If Setup is interrupted by a loss of power, a power surge, or some other
unexpected incident, restart Windows before you run Setup again.

If you have set up Trip Planner 98 using the basic installation option
and would like to install the "Faster performance" option, uninstall Trip
Planner 98 using the Control Panel Add/Remove Programs option and then
reinstall Trip Planner 98 and select the "Faster performance" option.

Uninstalling Trip Planner 97: If you try to use the Add/Remove Programs
Control Panel to uninstall Trip Planner 97 (last year's version) with the
Trip Planner 98 disc in your CD-ROM drive, the Setup program for Trip
Planner 98 will start up and proceed to uninstall this year's version.
Please be sure to place the Trip Planner 97 disc in the CD-ROM drive
before you attempt to uninstall Trip Planner 97.

CD-ROM Care

Do not remove the Trip Planner 98 compact disc from your CD-ROM drive
while you are running Trip Planner 98 unless you are prompted to do so.

Older CD-ROM drives may not be able to reliably access the files at the
outer edge of the compact disc. This problem may manifest as occasional
"Find" errors in which the product cannot find a place you know exists.
Just close the Find dialog box and try again.

Using Trip Planner 98 with Microsoft Expedia Streets 98

Trip Planner 98 shares its Pushpin database with Streets 98. If you own
Streets 98, mark addresses on the map using pushpins (Find Address) and
then view these pushpins in Trip Planner a great way to get a
more accurate fix on a place you are planning to visit. If you own Streets
98 Deluxe you can go one step further and import Yellow Pages listings,
convert them into pushpins and then run Trip Planner to plan a route
visiting each of these places. For example, you could select all Antique
stores in your state and then plan a trip visiting several of them.

The "quick switch" feature available in Trip Planner 97 is no longer
supported. You can, however, run both Trip Planner 98 and Streets 98
simultaneously on the same computer; just be sure to place the correct
CD-ROM in the drive when you switch to the respective application.

Upgrading from Older Versions of Automap Road Atlas and/or Streets

Do not install Trip Planner 98 into the same directory as older versions
such as Automap Road Atlas, Automap Trip Planner or Automap Streets Plus.
This can create a variety of problems including error messages such as
"Failed to initialize." Instead, install to the directory suggested during
Setup. If you do install into the same directory by mistake, uninstall
Trip Planner 98 using the Add/Remove programs Control Panel and then
reinstall it into the recommended different directory.

If you want to remove the older products you can do this either before
installing Trip Planner or afterwards. Go to Control Panel, Add/Remove
programs and select the old product you wish to remove. Click Add/Remove
and follow the instructions on screen. Be sure to insert the appropriate
product disc into the CD-ROM drive before uninstalling (for example, if
uninstalling Trip Planner 97, please insert the Trip Planner 97 disc
before proceeding).

Don't install older versions of Trip Planner into the same directory as
Trip Planner 98. If you install prior versions of Trip Planner into the
same directory as Trip Planner 98, you may experience error messages such
as "Failed to initialize." If this happens, please reinstall Expedia Trip
Planner 98.

Disk Space and Virtual Memory Issues

A variety of problems can occur when running Trip Planner 98 with less
than 30 MB of free disk space. If your computer has limited disk space,
please remove some files to free up space.

Trip Planner 98 is designed to use virtual memory. Turning off virtual
memory will cause problems.

Feature Issues

The Trip Planner 98 Travel Guide includes a large number of attractions.
Most of these are displayed on the map, but due to to limitations in the
availability of accurate location information for some attractions, not
all of them can be displayed on the map. Articles that include a Locate
button at the bottom of the Travel Guide window can be found on the map
you can click Locate to see the place. For places that lack a Locate
button, please contact the establishment for directions. In any case,
when planning a trip, it's always a good idea to call ahead to verify
locations, operating hours, fees, and other critical information.

Times displayed in the itinerary do not reflect time zone changes.

There's a quick way to switch between the Terrain and Road map styles:
just press Ctrl+M on your keyboard.

Internet Explorer and Internet Features

Trip Planner 98 is designed to work with the Internet Explorer 3.02
version shipped on the CD-ROM and installed during Setup. If you are
using pre-release or beta versions of Internet Explorer 4.0, you may
experience error messages or problems displaying Travel Guide articles.
Please update your pre-release Internet Explorer 4.0 to the released
version, or remove Internet Explorer 4 and reinstall Trip Planner to
restore Internet Explorer 3.02 on your system.

The Internet links in the product will not work if you are using a 16-bit
browser as your default browser. Microsoft Internet Explorer is installed
with the product and can be used as the default browser in many cases. If
you are using a 16-bit browser to access the Internet, please consider
switching to a 32-bit browser such as the provided Internet Explorer.

To make Internet Explorer your default browser, start Internet Explorer
from the Start menu. Then, from Internet Explorer, click Options on the
View menu, and then click the Programs tab. There is a checkbox "Internet
Explorer should check to see whether it is the default browser." Make sure
the box is checked, exit Internet Explorer, then start it again - it will
prompt to ask whether it can take over as the default browser.

If your connection to the Internet is via Dial-Up Networking and you
cancel connecting to a Web link, then the rest of the Web links in the
product will not work either. You must restart Trip Planner 98 to use the
Web links.

If you remove any portion of Internet Explorer from your system, the
product may fail to start up, or you may encounter error messages when
attempting to display Travel Guide articles in the product. Internet
Explorer is required for Trip Planner 98. You can reinstall Internet
Explorer by re-running the product Setup, or you can go directly to the
Trip Planner CD-ROM, browse into the [D:]\IE\English folder on the CD-ROM,
then run the Internet Explorer setup package from there.

Pushpin Issues

Imported text files cannot be mapped to the ZIP+4 level. If your data
contains ZIP+4 format addresses, remove all information other than the
base ZIP code from the entry.

If you copy an object from a word processor and paste it into a Pushpin
long note, the object may not paste. Paste the object directly from the
source (for example, the original Paint program or the Spreadsheet) into
the Pushpin, instead of through the word processor. This may also occur
when using Text File Import to import Rich Text Format (RTF) files.

If your hard disk drive is almost full, Trip Planner 98 may be unable to
create Pushpins. Free up more hard drive space so Pushpins can be created.

Display Issues

If you experience problems on the map such as road numbers (shields) not
displaying correctly check with the manufacturer of your graphics board to
see if updated drivers are available.  The manufacturer's web site is
usually a good place to look for updated drivers. This problem has been
noticed with the Diamond Stealth Pro driver in particular.

If you switch to another program while you are calculating a route in Trip
Planner 98, portions of your display may temporarily turn white. It is not
necessary to shut down Trip Planner 98 when this happens; in a few moments,
Trip Planner 98's regular display will return.

When switching screen resolutions in Windows 95 or Windows NT (for example,
going from a 640 X 480 to 1024 X 768 desktop), Trip Planner 98 may display
green blotches or black areas in its menu and buttons. To fix this, please
exit the application and restart it.

If you are running Windows NT 4.0, and you see highway shields that look
wrong (a small white box with the highway number spilling out of it), there
was a problem during Setup updating the Arial Narrow font on your computer
(ARIALN.TTF). To update this font, click the Start button on the task bar,
point to Find, click Files and Folders, and type ARIALN.TTF in the Named
box. Click the Find button to find all occurrences of this font on your
computer. Delete the one residing in the SYSTEM folder of the Windows NT
folder, then copy the ARIALN.TTF file from the Trip Planner 98 CD-ROM back
into the NT SYSTEM folder. The updated ARIALN.TTF file is available on the
Trip Planner 98 disk at [D:]\Acmsetup\Fonts\ARIALN.TTF.

FlexiCD and CD Player

If you are running FlexiCD or CD Player, you may encounter an error when
trying to start Trip Planner 98. To resolve this simply exit from FlexiCD
or CD Player before starting Trip Planner 98.

MSCam

MSCam is a screen capture utility included with Microsoft Office 97.
Expedia Trip Planner 98 will not run while MSCam is running.

Hardware Issues

Trip Planner 98 will run best with multi CD-ROM changers if you run Trip
Planner from the same drive from which it was installed. Also, if you want
to listen to audio CDs at the same time, it is best to start Trip Planner
98 and then start your audio CD.

The Sanyo three-disc CD-ROM driver is not compatible with some 32-bit hard
disk drivers. Please check with Sanyo for resolution steps.

The Plextor 6PLEX CD-ROM drive may cause "fail to read" messages. You will
need to upgrade your CD-ROM drive to an 8PLEX or another more recent model.

Windows NT users running Trip Planner 98 on a machine with a Number 9
Imagine 128 Series II may experience periodic crashes (blue screen). If
this happens, please download an updated NT video driver from Number 9.

If your computer reports that it cannot find the Trip Planner CD-ROM, and
you are using a CD Audio player on the computer, please confirm that the
MCICDA.DRV file is the same file shipped with Microsoft Windows 95. There
are some third-party MCICDA drivers that can cause problems with certain
applications. To fix this problem, open Control Panel, open Multimedia,
click Advanced, then click Media Control Devices. Double-click the MCI CD
Audio device and click Remove. To reinstall CD Audio, open Control Panel,
open Add New Hardware, and indicate No to "search for new hardware." In
the next panel, select Sound, Video And Game Controllers, and then select
Microsoft MCI. You will see CD Audio Device listed; install it and then
restart your system.

If you have a Microsoft Intellipoint Mouse and Command Software's F-Prot,
the Intellipoint Mouse may not work with Expedia Trip Planner 98. Upgrade
to the latest version of F-Prot to resolve this problem.

Troubleshooting Printing Problems

If you encounter problems when printing from Trip Planner 98, such as
no printout, low print quality, or erratic text being printed, there are
several ways to troubleshoot or correct the problem.

There is a "Print simpler maps" option on the Print Map and Print Route
dialog boxes. If you set this option, Trip Planner 98 will print a lower
resolution map, which may work better on certain printers or in certain
memory configurations. The print quality is still quite good in the lower
resolution mode. Even if your printer supports high resolution printing,
you may choose the "Print simpler maps" option to speed up printing.

If the printer displays a message or an error indicator, see your printer
manual for information about how to correct the problem.

When a printer will not print at all, the cause is often a simple
mechanical problem; that is, the printer may be offline, or not connected
to the computer. Please check the following:

Make sure that the printer is plugged in and turned on.
Make sure that the correct port is specified for your printer.
Make sure that you have the correct cable for your printer and that the
   cable is connected properly.
In Windows 95, check your printer setup: click Start, point to Settings,
   and then click Printers. Verify the printer information displayed.

If Pushpin symbols print out as black squares or "blobs," please try
using the "Print simpler maps" option. If that doesn't help, please contact
your video card manufacturer for an updated display driver. Trip Planner 98
uses the display driver to render maps before printing (this approach has
been found to work successfully on the greatest variety of printer types).
Out-of-date or incompatible display drivers can degrade print quality.

If you receive an "Out of Memory" error message when printing, check your
printer settings in Control Panel. Open Control Panel, open Printers, and
then right-click on your printer icon to view the properties. Verify that
the amount of printer memory installed in the printer matches the setting
specified in Control Panel.

The second title on the Print Route dialog box is automatically filled
in by Trip Planner 98 the first time you go to print the route. This title
consists of the route summary details. On subsequent uses of this dialog
box, this initial text still remains, even if the route has changed (and
therefore the summary details as well). You can change the second title
yourself using the Print Route dialog box.

Information about the Microsoft GPS Add-on

Notes on GPS

If you are running a GPS on a lower spec machine, and are experiencing
problems, set the device so that it is communicating at 4800 baud, 8 bits,
parity set to None and 1 stop bit. Set Communication to either NMEA 0183
V1.5 or V2.0 format. If the device allows, set the frequency of sending
messages to every two seconds.

If a problem occurs while you are installing multiple Plug and Play GPS
receivers using the Windows 95 Control Panel, exit the Control Panel. The
devices will be automatically installed by the system.

If two devices from the same manufacturer are installed on the same
serial port, the GPS Add-on cannot guarantee that the correct device will
be chosen. To remedy this, use GPS devices from the same manufacturer on
different serial ports or PC card slots, or have only one installed at
a time.

The following NMEA message combinations have been tested and are known
to produce a location fix (even if the device will not auto-detect in the
Control Panel, you should manually detect in this case):

BWC, APA, GLL, VTG (NMEA 0183 V1.5)
RMC, RMB (NMEA 0183 V1.5)
BWC, XTE, GLL, VTG (NMEA 0183 V1.5)
APB, GGA, VTG, BWC, GLL (NMEA 0183 V2.0)

Magellan DLX-10: Press the AUX button and select the NMEA menu. For best
results, select the 0183D option.

Garmin GPS 45: Press the Page button until the menu appears. Select I/O
Setup. On the next screen, select either None/NMEA or NMEA/NMEA. For the
output format, select NMEA 0183 2.0.

Trimble Scoutmaster: If you are using a Trimble Scoutmaster and are
experiencing problems, open the Control Panel and set GPS to use the
Trimble Scoutmaster driver. Using the menus on your GPS device, reset
the Scoutmaster to use default settings.

An NMEA compatible device: Set the device so that it is communicating at
4800 baud, 8 bits, parity set to None and 1 stop bit. Set Communication to
either NMEA 0183 V1.5 or V2.0 format. NMEA compatible devices may not
support all features mentioned in the GPS Add-on section in Help.

The Socket Revision C card installs as a Trimble device under Windows NT.
This installation will not affect the performance of this device.
