WORKAROUND

Installer application with the "Destination Platforms" setting configured for
"True Win32".

1. From the Installation Expert view, select Advanced Configuration, and then
   double-click the Global option.

   Or from the Script Editor view, click Edit, and then Installation Properties.

2. Select the Global tab (if it isn't selected), and change the "Destination
   Platforms" setting at the bottom of the window to "Windows 95 and NT (True
   Win32)".

3. Recompile the SMS Installer executable.
