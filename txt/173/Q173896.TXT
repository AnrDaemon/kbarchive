TITLE   :XWEB: Err Msg: Netscape is Unable to Connect to the Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Netscape Communicator to access a Microsoft Exchange Server
using Outlook Web Access (OWA), and rapidly click the Seen button, the following
message may be displayed:

   Netscape is unable to connect to the server at the location you have
   specified. The server may be down or busy. Try connecting again later.

This message may give you the impression that there is a problem with the
Exchange Server, which is not the case.

CAUSE
=====

Netscape Communicator establishes a connection to the Exchange Server each time
the Seen button is clicked in order to perform a store command. The number of
concurrent IMAP connections it can keep open are limited. As soon as this limit
is reached, all connections are closed by Netscape and the above error message
is reported.
