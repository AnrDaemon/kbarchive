TITLE   :WD97: Chart Missing When Pasting Grouped Items from Excel
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you paste grouped items, including a chart object
created in Microsoft Excel 97, the chart is missing.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, in Excel, select and copy the chart and the other
items (a text box in this example) without grouping them. Then paste the objects
into Word and group them there. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Excel, select the text box, and then press and hold down the SHIFT key and
   select the chart.

   Both objects should be selected.

2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

3. In Word, click Paste on the Edit menu.

4. Right-click the selected objects, point to Grouping, and then click Group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTES:

 - The image of the chart appears on the clipboard and is pasted into both Excel
   and Microsoft PowerPoint.

 - This symptom occurs with any object grouped with a chart; however, when you
   group any objects other than a chart, pasting works as expected.
