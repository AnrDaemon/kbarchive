SYMPTOMS

Visual FoxPro v5.0a is not able to display or print the BarCode font correctly.

FoxPro v5.0a that ships with the Visual Studio Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have a BarCode font installed on your system and you set the fonts for
objects to it, the objects are not displayed in the BarCode format at
design-time or at run-time. This behavior occurs with Forms, Reports, or any
other Visual FoxPro object that displays data. The same BarCode font displays
correctly in Microsoft Word and Excel.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following steps are based on the assumption that a BarCode font is already
installed on your system:

1. Open a New Report or a Form using the Report or the Form Designer,
   respectively.

2. Add some objects that display data to the report (for example, Fields or
   Labels) or the form (for example, TextBox, ListBox, or Grid).

3. Select one of the objects. For the report, set the Font of the object to the
   Barcode font from the Fonts dialog (Format-->Font). For a form, set the
   FontName property of the object to the BarCode Font.

4. In the Report/Form Designer, note that the object does not display its
   contents with the BarCode format.

5. Repeat step 4 for several objects and note that none of them are displayed
   with the BarCode format.

6. Preview/Print the Report or run the Form, and note that the objects that are
   assigned the BarCode font do not display in the BarCode Format.
