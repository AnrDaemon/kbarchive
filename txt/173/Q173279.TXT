TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Issues Incorrect Event ID
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service is configured to refuse
connections based on IP addresses, the Internet Mail Service issues Event ID 220
rather than Event ID 521. The message originator will not receive a non-delivery
receipt (NDR) immediately with the message:

   521 access denied

Instead, the message delivery will be retried until it times out, and then an NDR
is returned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
