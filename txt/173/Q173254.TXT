SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 Step by Step, page 24 step 6, asks you to change the
font properties for three labels. When you perform this step, you may see the
following error message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
   problem persists, contact the program vendor. VB5 caused an invalid page
   fault in module VB5.EXE.

The Visual Basic development environment will then close.

CAUSE
=====

This error is the result of a known bug in Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0. The
following text is taken from the Readme.hlp file included with the Visual Basic
5.0 program:

   If the Properties window is floating, and two or more controls are selected,
   and you change the Font property of the controls using the floating
   Properties window, a program fault will occur in Visual Basic.

WORKAROUND
==========

In step 6, rather than changing the font property for all three labels
simultaneously, change the font properties as shown for each label in
succession.

   -or-

Make sure the properties window is docked before beginnning the steps at the
bottom of page 23.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 for
Windows. This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2
