SUMMARY
=======

If you are having problems when you run a particular game, it may help if you
shut down all other programs before you start the game. This is a good
troubleshooting step if you are receiving system error messages, your computer
hangs or freezes, or other unusual problems occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following steps to shut down all running programs:

1. Close all the programs that you can see are open.

2. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.

3. Click a program or task and then click End Task.

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all programs are shut down EXCEPT Explorer and Systray
   (these are components of Windows and should not be shut down).

5. After you close all running programs, try to run the game again.
