TITLE   :WinNT 4.0 Post SP3 Hotfix Can Cause Stop 0x1E in Win32k.sys
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Double Click or Java Post Service Pack 3 (SP3) hotfixes, the
system blue screens with a stop error message in Win32k.sys:

   STOP: 0x0000001e (0xc000001d, 0x00000023, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)

The first parameter is consistently 0xc000001d, the remaining parameters have
varied.

The STOP screen occurs before you can attempt to uninstall the hotfix.

CAUSE
=====

Installing the Post SP3 hotfix Double Click or Java after the GetAdmin hotfix
causes the Win32k.sys file to be incompatible with the kernel.

The Win32k.sys file furnished with the Double Click hotfix and the Java hotfix is
not compatible with the kernel furnished with the GetAdmin hotfix. The
Win32k.sys file furnished with the GetAdmin hotfix is dated 7/12/97. The
versions of Win32k.sys supplied with the other hotfixes have earlier dates.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace the Win32k.sys file with the version from the GetAdmin hotfix, dated
7/12/97.

If the operating system is installed on a FAT partition, this can be accomplished
by starting the system with a DOS boot floppy disk and copying the correct
Win32k.sys from the most recently installed hotfix uninstall directory to the
System32 directory.

The Double Click hotfix uninstall directory is $NTUninstallQ170510$. The Java
hotfix uninstall directory is $NTUninstallQ168748$. Both reside under the system
root directory, usually called \Winnt.

If the operating system is installed on an NTFS partition, a parallel
installation of the operating system can be done and the file can be replaced in
the manner described above while you are booted to the parallel installation.

If a parallel installation is not possible (for example, there is insufficient
disk space), perform the following steps:

1. Make a copy of the current Emergency Repair Disk (ERD).

2. Delete the registry hives from the ERD you just copied (this is required in
   order to make sufficient space for the Win32k.sys file on the disk).

3. Copy the correct version of the Win32k.sys file to the root of the ERD (the
   file can be obtained by running the hotfix with the /x option on a system
   running Windows NT 4.0. This extracts the files without installing the fix).

4. Change the attributes of the Setup.log file on the ERD (use the attrib - s -h
   -r Setup.log command).

5. Add the following information to the BEGINNING of the section:

      [Files.WinNt]:

         \Winnt\System32\Win32k.sys = "win32k.sys","12d370","\","nt40 repair
         disk","win32k.sys"

6. Run the Emergency Repair Procedure, verifying system files only.

7. When prompted, replace the Win32k.sys file.

8. After replacing the Win32k.sys file, exit setup. This leaves the other files
   intact.

9. Restart the system.
