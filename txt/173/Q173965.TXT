PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using more than 20 SQL Statements in an Internet Database Connector
(IDC) file, you may get the following error message:

   Error performing query maximum number of SQL statement fields in
   the idc file has been exceeded.

CAUSE
=====

The Httpodbc.dll file was hard coded to support a maximum of 20 SQL Statements
per IDC file.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new version of the Httpodbc.dll file allows a maximum of 100 SQL Statements
per IDC file. This new version will only work with Microsoft Windows NT Server
Service Pack 3 (SP3) or later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 3.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem.

Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends
that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact
Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
