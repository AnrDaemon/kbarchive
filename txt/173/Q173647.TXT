How to Find ADO Knowledge Base Articles
---------------------------------------

ADO is not a technology that ships with one particular product, and has been
treated as a product in its own right. To find ADO articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (KB) on the Web, connect to:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/a.asp?M=S

and choose "ActiveX Data Objects" as the product and enter your specific search
topic.

You can also pick "All Microsoft Products" or use the MSDN or other non-Web-based
Knowledge Base search mechanisms, and search for the keyword "kbado," which all
ADO articles contain.

ADO Resources/Points of Information
-----------------------------------

ADO originally shipped with the OLE-DB Software Development Kit (SDK), but now is
part of Microsoft Data Access Components or MDAC. To learn more about it, please
visit the Microsoft Universal Data Access Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/data/

or the ADO-specific Web page at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/data/ado/default.htm
