   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

AS/400 applications that require specific page width (or maximum print position)
settings may not print correctly when printed via a 5250 print session
configured in SNA Server 3.0 or 3.0 SP1. Print jobs that have truncated lines
are one example of how this problem may appear.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server print service only supports a limited range of values for the
Maximum Print Position (MPP) SCS control code for the 5250 data stream. The
supported values for 5250 printing are 80, 132, 158, and 198.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the SNA Server print service accepts MPP SCS control codes
in the 5250 data stream for any language and to change the line length
accordingly. The print service will also set an overall MPP value for each print
job as it starts. To set this value, edit registry as follows.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: This registry parameter is only needed if you want a default MPP value for
each print job. If each print job includes an MPP SCS control code that sets the
line length, this registry entry is not required.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe, as appropriate for your
   version of Windows NT).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\snaprint\ 
   parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

   "Value Name: mpp
   Data Type: REG_SZ" (without the quotation marks)

   In the Value field, type a value between 40 and 255. The Default value is 132.
   The range is 40-255.

4. Exit Registry Editor.

This registry parameter is only needed if you want a default MPP value for each
print job. If each print job includes an MPP SCS control code that sets the line
length, this registry entry is not required.
