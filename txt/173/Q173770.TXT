SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you run the Check Links command on a Web page that
contains redirected links, Word may find that some redirected links are broken.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, when Word prompts you that a redirected link is
broken, click Ignore in the "Check Links: Broken Link" dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A redirected link is one that redirects you to a different Web page.

The new Check Links feature in the Web Authoring Tools Update checks each
hyperlink or linked image in a Word 97 Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document
to verify that the target destination exists. For each broken hyperlink, Word
prompts you to update the hyperlink.
