======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Access 97 Visual Basic Step by Step ISBN 1-57231-319-6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When following the steps on pages 11 and 12 of "Microsoft Access 97 Visual Basic
Step by Step," you may receive one or more of the following error messages:

   Text file specification field separator matches decimal separator or text
   delimiter.

   An error occurred trying to import file 'C:\Access VBA
   Practice\01Client.txt.' The file was not imported.

CAUSE
=====

In many countries, Microsoft Access 97 cannot import a comma-delimited text file
created in the United States. In these countries, commas are used as decimal
separators in numbers. This conflicts with American comma- delimited text files.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Click Regional Settings, and on the Regional Settings tab click to select
   English (United States) from the list.

3. Click OK and restart your computer when prompted.

NOTE: You should return the international setting to its previous setting when
you have finished Lesson One of "Microsoft Access 97/Visual Basic Step by Step."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
