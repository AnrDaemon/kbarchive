SUMMARY
=======

Novell has written a conversion utility to copy mail from a Microsoft Mail .mmf
file to Novell GroupWise. This utility uses the Novell GroupWise API gateway to
process a text file created from the .mmf file. Additional options are added to
the File menu of the Microsoft Mail Windows client that creates this text file
and copies the text file to the appropriate subdirectory of the NGW API gateway.
The text file is converted to messages and are transmitted from the NGW API post
office to the users mailbox on GroupWise.
