-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change the bullet type in a Web page, Microsoft Word 97 adds
a second bullet instead of changing the first bullet.

CAUSE
=====

In HTML documents, bullets are actually graphic images; therefore, every time
you select another bullet, Word adds another graphic. This lets you add as many
bullets per line as you want.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you must first delete the original bullet, and
then add the new bullet. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click to select the bullet, and press DELETE.

2. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering, and then click the Bulleted
   tab.

3. Click to select a bullet type and click OK.
