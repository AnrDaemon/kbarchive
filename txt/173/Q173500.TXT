==========

To resolve this issue, replace the Wsock32.dll file. To do so, use the following
steps:

1. Click Start, click Shut Down, click "Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode,"
   and then click Yes.

2. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER

   "<drive>:" (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the letter of the drive on which Windows is installed.
   For example, if Windows is installed on drive C, type the following:

   "c:" (without the quotation marks)

3. Type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each command:

   "cd\windows\system

   ren wsock32.dll wsock32.old

   exit" (without the quotation marks)

4. Extract a new copy of the Wsock32.dll file to the Windows\System folder. You
   can extract the Wsock32.dll file from the following locations:
    - The Win95_11.cab cabinet file on the Windows 95 CD-ROM

    - The Win95_12.cab cabinet file on the original Windows 95 DMF disks

    - The Win95_19.cab cabinet file on the original Windows 95 non-DMF disks

    - The Win95_18.cab cabinet file on the Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2
      CD-ROM

   If you are using Microsoft Windows 98, you can extract the Wsock32.dll file
   from the following location:
    - The Precopy1.cab cabinet file on the Windows 98 CD-ROM.

5. Restart your computer normally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue may also occur if you run RegClean, version 3.0 or 4.0, on your
computer, and then attempt to run Visual Basic for Applications code that uses
Automation to control another program. The issue occurs because RegClean 3.0 or
4.0 removes the keys that are required to use Automation.
