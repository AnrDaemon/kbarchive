OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbhw kbnetwork kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Windows NT on a computer using the Compex NE2000-compatible
network interface card (NIC), the network may not start and the system event log
may contain the following error message:

   Event ID: 7000
   Source : Service Control Manager
   Description: A device attached to the system is not functioning.

CAUSE
=====

The default configuration for the Compex NE2000-compatible adapter is for Plug
and Play functionality. For proper operation with Windows NT, the Compex NE2000
must use explicit configuration settings.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the MS-DOS setup utilities that come with the
adapter to disable the Plug and Play setting. Set the card to an available IRQ
and base I/O address, then remove and reinstall the Windows NT network adapter
driver.
