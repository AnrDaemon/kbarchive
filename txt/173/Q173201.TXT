TITLE   :XCLN: Exchange Brings Up IE Dial-up Connection on Start-up
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:Win95:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


You have a Microsoft Exchange profile set to connect with a dial-up networking
connection. You also have another dial-up networking connection set in Microsoft
Internet Explorer on the Connection tab, under Connect to the Internet as Needed
(formerly Autodial). Exchange brings up the Internet Explorer connection on
start-up despite being set for another dial-up connection. When Autodial is
disabled, Exchange uses whatever connection is specified on the Exchange Server
Service Dial-Up Networking tab.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The dial-up connection dialog box is called because of
initialization of the TCP/IP protocol on the local computer. Anything that you
call up that uses TCP/IP will bring up the specified connection. There is no way
to adjust the LAN Adapter (LANA) order to change this.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Create a separate Hardware Profile to use Autodial. You must restart the
   computer and start the other profile in order to use Autodial.

 - Disable Autodial, and create a shortcut on the desktop for the ISP
   connection. You will need to open this connection prior to starting Internet
   Explorer.

 - Disable Autodial before starting the Exchange dial-up session, and enable
   Autodial when finished.
