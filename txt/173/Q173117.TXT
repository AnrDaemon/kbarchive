PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a new Microsoft Word 97 document and copy styles into the Word
document from another template through the Style Gallery, you cannot undo that
action by clicking the Undo button (or by clicking Undo on the Edit menu).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Style Gallery is used to copy styles from other templates to your document
and does not change the template attached to your document. The Style Gallery
also does not write the changes to the Undo stack; therefore, no changes can be
undone when you click the Undo button or click Undo on the Edit menu.

For additional information about the Style Gallery, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

For more information about the Style Gallery, click the Office Assistant, type
"style gallery," click Search, and then click one of the responding choices.

Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
