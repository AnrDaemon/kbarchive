TITLE   :XCON: NDR Sent to Originator Instead of DL Owner
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message to a distribution list (DL) that is larger than the
established message size limit for that DL, a non-delivery report (NDR) is
generated and sent back to you, the message originator, regardless of the
options set on the Advanced tab of the DL's Properties dialog box. For example,
you send a 50-KB message to a DL called Test that has a maximum message size
restriction of 25 KB. Also, on the Advanced tab, Distribution List options, the
Report to message originator option is disabled (unavailable), and the Report to
distribution list owner option is enabled. Instead of the DL owner receiving an
NDR as expected, you, the originator,
receive the NDR.

CAUSE
=====

The Report-to-Owner and Report-to-Sender fields that direct this action do not
apply to DLs but only to users. When an oversized message is sent to a DL, the
message transfer agent (MTA) checks the message size and sends the NDR back
before the DL expansion process takes place. In this case, only the default
Report-to- Sender function is called, and the NDR goes to the originator.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
