PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a Remote Control session, the Pause key at the administrator's console is
mapped to the NUMLOCK key. Pressing the Pause key during a Remote Control
session engages NUMLOCK on both the client and the administrator's workstations.
This problem only occurs when a 16-bit client running Wuser.exe is being
controlled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, have the user on the remote client computer press
the NUMLOCK key.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
