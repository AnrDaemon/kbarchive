The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, an image may not be correctly displayed in a table in an HTML
document if any of the following conditions is true.

Case 1: No Image Size Specified
-------------------------------

The HTML code to insert the image into the table does not specify its size.

Case 2: Image Wider Than Preset Size of Table Column
----------------------------------------------------

The HTML code specifies the column size of the table, and you insert an image
that is wider than the preset column size.

Case 3: Document Is in Online Layout View
-----------------------------------------

In online layout view, Word may display extra space to the right of the image or
truncate the image near the right column boundary of the table.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs when you insert images into a cell of a table.

Case 1: No Image Size Specified
-------------------------------

When you do not specify the size of the image, Word does not know what size to
make it; therefore, Word only shows a very small portion of the graphic.

Case 2: Image Wider Than Preset Size of Table Column
----------------------------------------------------

When you specify the width of a column and then insert a picture that is wider
than the preset size, the picture does not fit and is not displayed properly.

Case 3: Document Is in Online Layout View
-----------------------------------------

The default view for HTML documents in Word 97 is online layout view. Online
layout view automatically sizes the column widths of tables to fill the screen
horizontally. However, online layout view does not resize images. This behavior
is by design, in order to prevent images from appearing distorted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To have the graphic displayed correctly, use the appropriate method for your
situation.

Case 1: No Image Size Specified
-------------------------------

Save your HTML document, close it, and then reopen the document. When you reopen
the document, Word automatically resizes the table cells based on their
content.

NOTE: This method only works if the cell that contains the image has not been
previously defined with a preset size.

Case 2: Image Wider Than Preset Size of Table Column
----------------------------------------------------

If you know the width of the image, follow these steps:

1. Click in the table cell containing the image.

2. On the Table menu, click Cell Properties.

3. Change the Width to a size greater than or equal to the image width, and then
   click OK.

Case 3: Document Is in Online Layout View
-----------------------------------------

To display the table with the defined column widths, change to page layout view.
To do this, click Page Layout view on the View menu.
