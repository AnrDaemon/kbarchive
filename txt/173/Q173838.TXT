TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 Evaluation Edition Incompatible With FAT32
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP Training 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While installing the Evaluation Edition of Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 from one of
the Microsoft Press training kits listed above, you may encounter an error
message stating that there is no valid partition.

CAUSE
=====

If the drive was originally formatted for the installation of Windows 95, the
partition may be marked for FAT 32. Windows NT 4.0 does not currently recognize
the FAT 32 format and, therefore, will not install. If this is the case, you
must back up all data and create new partitions either from Windows NT 4.0 or
from MS-DOS 6.22 in order to continue the installation.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FAT 32 file system is designed to work with hard disk partitions over 512 MB
in size. The OEM version of Microsoft Windows 95 will automatically format the
hard disk using FAT 32 if the hard drive size is over 512 MB and the "large disk
compatibility" option has been selected in FDISK.
