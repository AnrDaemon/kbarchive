SUMMARY
=======

Queries issued against Index Server may return pointers to information that you
do not wish users to see, such as scripts or cgi-bin folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To keep Index Server from returning queries to documents in certain folder, you
can do one of the following:

 - If the folder is a virtual root you can tell Index Server not to index it. To
   do this, go the Index Server administration page, and select the View/Update
   Indexing of Virtual Roots button. Then clear the virtual root you do not wish
   to index.

 - If the folder is not a virtual root, you must add an entry to the
   CiRestriction in the .idq file. If you know the path to the folder you want
   to exclude from the result set, add the following CiRestriction to the .idq
   file:

      cirestriction=(%cirestriction%) and not #vpath
      \virtualroot\foldername.

   This will pass the cirestriction from the query form; however, it will not
   return any documents in the /virtualroot/subfolder directory.

   If copies of the folder exist in multiple locations, you can modify the query
   to the following:

      cirestriction=(%cirestriction%) and not #vpath *\foldername

   The leading * tells Index Server to look for this folder through out the web,
   not just in a specific location.

NOTE: On Windows 2000 NTFS volumes, the attribute
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED can be set for directories and files, so that
the direcotries and files are not indexed by the Windows 2000 Indexing Service.

Additional query words: uncheck FPIIS _vti restrict exclude Results
