-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience either of the following symptoms:

 - When you log on to Windows NT, there is a long delay.

   -or-

 - After you log on to Windows NT, response to some user input is very slow. For
   example, when you click Start, it takes much longer than expected for the
   Start Menu to be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you change the default settings for RPC services.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Control Panel, double-click Services, and then confirm the following
settings:

 - Remote Procedure Call (RPC) locator:
   Status - not started
   Startup - manual

 - Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service:
   Status - started
   Startup - automatic

You can also confirm these settings remotely using the Server Manager utility
included on the Windows NT Server 4.0 compact disc. To do so, follow these
steps:

1. In Server Manager, select the problem computer.

2. On the Computer menu, click Services. Confirm the RPC settings as listed
   above. These settings are dynamic and do not require a restarting if you make
   a change.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The server service is unaffected on a computer with the above problem;
therefore, network file access from a remote client may appear to function
normally.
