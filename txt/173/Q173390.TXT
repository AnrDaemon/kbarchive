The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Contrary to what the Visual Basic documentation states (including Books Online
and Help files), the Status property of the rdoResultset/rdoColumn object cannot
be modified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using the optimistic batch update cursor library, the Status property
indicates the status of the current row for an rdoResultset or rdoColumn
object.

Prior to the BatchUpdate operation, its value determines if and how a row will
update in the next optimistic batch update. Once BatchUpdate is complete, its
value can be re-examined to determine if the update was successful.

If an attempt is made to set this property at run-time, one or both of the
following error will occur:

   Run-time error '-2147467263 (80004001)': Object Collection: Couldn't find
   item indicated by text.

   -or-

   Run-time error '445': Object doesn't support this action.

NOTE: The above errors are not consistent with run-time errors caused by setting
read-only properties.
