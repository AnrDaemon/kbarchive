viewed articles. To return to a previously viewed article in Bookshelf 98, click
the Backlist menu, and then click the article you want to view.

You can also press the CTRL+B key combination to return to recently viewed
articles in the order in which you viewed them.

NOTE: Only the twenty most recently viewed articles are listed on the Backlist
menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The improved Bookshelf 99 user interface includes Back and Forward arrow buttons
on the menu bar that enable you to navigate between articles you previously
viewed.

In addition, Bookshelf 99 includes a Favorites feature that enables you to store
shortcuts to articles you may want to view again.
