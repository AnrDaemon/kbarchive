The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose a large size as part of your Windows desktop scheme, such as
High Contrast White (Extra Large), the graphic on the Select Browse Object
button (located between the Next and Previous buttons on the vertical scrollbar)
does not get larger.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word 97. The graphics on the toolbar
buttons do not change size based on your Windows desktop scheme.
