SUMMARY
=======

If any entries are migrated from a personal address book (PAB) when you migrate
from Microsoft Mail to Microsoft Exchange using the Microsoft Exchange Server
Migration Wizard, then you will receive a message from the Exchange Server
computer with instructions on how to import these entries into the Microsoft
Exchange Client. This article contains instructions on how to import PAB entries
into the Microsoft Outlook Client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Clients attach to the Exchange Server information store using MAPI. Because the
Microsoft Exchange Server computer does not know what type of client is attached
to it, the Exchange Server computer does not produce a message for all the
variations of clients available.

To import PAB entries into the Microsoft Outlook Client, follow these steps:

1. From the File menu in Microsoft Outlook, select Save Attachments.

2. Click the Save button to save the .pab file.

3. From the File menu, select Import and Export to activate the Import and
   Export Wizard.

4. In the the Import and Export Wizard, select Import from a Microsoft Mail file
   (.mmf), and click Next.

5. Select the .pab file and click the Open button.

6. Click the OK button when you are asked to confirm the personal address book
   you have selected.

7. An Import Mail Data completion message box will appear detailing the imported
   messages and PAB entries.
