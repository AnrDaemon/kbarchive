TITLE   :WD97: Borders Overlap When You Position Frames Side by Side
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbframe kblayout

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The left and right borders overlap by about 4 points on frames positioned side
by side when you use the Format Frames dialog box. For example if you create 2
frames and set the width of each to 1 inch, and then set the horizontal position
of the first frame to 1 inch and the horizontal position of the second frame to
2 inches, the borders of the frames will overlap by about 4 points.


CAUSE
=====

The left and right borders of a frame are approximately 4 points larger than the
dimension specified in the Width setting of the Format Frame dialog box. The
Horizontal Position of the left frame border is offset approximately 2 points to
the left of the position specified in the Horizontal Position of the Format
Frame dialog box. When you try to position two frames next to each other so that
their left and right borders touch, they will overlap by approximately 4 points
if the frame width and horizontal position do not compensate for these offsets.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

 - Use text boxes instead of frames.

   -or-

 - Adjust the width and horizontal position of the frames to compensate for the
   offsets.

MORE INFORMATION
================

STATUS
