SUMMARY
=======

Netlogon creates many errors that are recorded in the event log, which
eventually fills or wraps the log.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Netlogon.chg file is located on all domain controllers, but is used only by
the primary domain controller (PDC) to keep track of changes made to the
security databases. All changes to the security databases are recorded in this
log file, along with the serial number of the change. Each of the three security
databases maintains a separate serial number, which is incremented once for each
change. When a backup domain controller (BDC) requests a particular change from
the PDC, the PDC checks the change log to determine which changes need to be
sent.

Specific Events and Errors
--------------------------

The following events may be recorded on the BDC:

   Event ID: 5717
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Information
   The full synchronization replication of the LSA database from the primary
   domain controller \\<DOMAIN CONTROLLER> completed successfully.

   Event ID: 5716
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Warning
   The partial synchronization replication of the SAM database from the primary
   domain controller <DOMAIN CONTROLLER> failed with the following error:

   <THERE IS NO ERROR REPORTED>

   The Data section contains c0000134 (Words) or 34 01 00 c0 (Bytes.); the
   c0000134 indicates STATUS_SYNCHRONIZATION_REQUIRED.

The following events may be reported on the PDC:

   Event ID: 5713
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Information
   The full synchronization request from the server <SERVERNAME> completed
   successfully. <X> object(s) has(have) been returned to the caller.

   Event ID: 5712
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Warning
   The partial synchronization request from the server <SERVERNAME> failed
   with the following error:

   <THERE IS NO ERROR REPORTED>

Trying to promote a BDC to a PDC may cause the following pop-up window message to
stay on the screen indefinitely:

"Synchronizing <BDC> with its primary"

The following event log error may be generated:

   Event ID: 5705
   Source: NETLOGON
   Type: Error
   The change log cache maintained by the Netlogon Service for database changes
   is corrupted. The Netlogon service is resetting the change log.

These events can be caused when Windows NT fails to update the
%SystemRoot%\Netlogon.chg file on the PDC. This may occur for any of the
following reasons:

 - The Read-Only attribute could be set.

 - The netlogon.chg file could be corrupted.

 - The permissions for the system account could be insufficient for that file;
   they should be at least RWXD.

Resolving the Problem
---------------------

If the Netlogon.chg file has been corrupted, you may need to delete or rename the
file. However, this file is always in use by the system.

To delete (reset) the Netlogon.chg file on an NTFS partition, use the following
steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer, and then navigate to the %systemroot% folder.

2. Right-click the Netlogon.chg file, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Security tab.

4. Click to clear the "Allow inheritable permissions from parent to propagate to
   this object" check box, and then click OK.

5. In the Security dialog box, click Copy to copy the existing inheritable
   permissions to this object.

6. Click the System account, click "Deny - Full Control" to change all of the
   permissions to Deny, and then click OK.

7. Restart the computer. After you log on to the computer, delete the
   Netlogon.chg file.

8. Restart the computer again. When you log on the computer, the Netlogon.chg
   file is rebuilt automatically.

To delete (reset) the Netlogon.chg file on a FAT partition, use the following
steps:

1. Start the system using MS-DOS, and then delete the %SystemRoot%\Netlogon.chg
   file.

2. Restart using Windows NT. The file will be recreated at startup.
