TITLE   :WD97: Cannot Use Visual Fox Pro ODBC Driver in Word Mail Merge
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdta winword word97 kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a mail merge in Microsoft Word 97 with a data file from Visual
Fox Pro, Visual Fox Pro is not available in the Files Of Type list; and if Word
finds the file, it does not open it.

This problem applies to files with the .dbc or .dbf file name extensions.

CAUSE
=====

In order for Word to list a file type in the Files Of Type list during a mail
merge, Word needs an installable Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) file
for the product.

Because there is no installable ISAM file for Visual Fox Pro, the Visual Fox Pro
option is not available in the Files Of Type list.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, install the latest
version of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). To obtain the latest version
of MDAC, please browse to the following Microsoft Web site:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem does not occur in
Microsoft Word 2000.
