SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to provide you with the information needed to
move a Windows NT 3.5x profile from a local user to a domain user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the profile to be edited is on a computer running Windows 3.51 Workstation,
then the Windows NT Server 3.51 tools will need to installed on the computer
running Windows NT Workstation in order to get access to the Profile editor
program. Windows NT Server 3.51 tools are stored on the Windows NT Server 3.51
CD in the client's directory.

Install the programs from the MS-DOS prompt with the batch file, Setup.bat,
located in the Clients\Srvtools\Winnt subdirectory. You will need administrative
privileges on the local computer to complete the task.

To install these programs and move the profile, perform the following steps:

1. Log on to the computer as either a domain administrator or local
   administrator at the computer running Windows NT Workstation.

2. From the Windows NT Server 3.51 CD, install Server tools (they are located in
   the Client\Srvtools\Winnt subdirectory) run the Setup.bat program in the
   WINNT subdirectory. The system will do the rest. (Use this step if the local
   profile is located on a computer running Windows NT Workstation 3.51
   otherwise, ignore.)

3. Add the local user to the local administrator group.

4. Log off and log on to the workstation as the local user.

5. Using Windows NT Setup, delete the domain users profile.

6. Using Profile Editor, click Save as user default from the File menu. Ensure
   that the local users account is listed in the Permitted to Use Profile dialog
   box.

7. Log off and log on the computer as the domain user.

The domain user's profile should now be the same as the local user profile. At
this point, you can remove the local user from the local administrators group
and remove the Windows NT Server tools from the workstation.
