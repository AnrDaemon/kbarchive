TITLE   :Client Cannot Resolve MX Record via Microsoft DNS Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Domain Name Service (DNS)
server, your clients may not be able to successfully resolve mail server names
to IP addresses.

CAUSE
=====

The DNS client is sending a recursive query to the Microsoft DNS server, which
is forwarding that query to a BIND-based DNS server. Some BIND-based DNS servers
return a Start of Authority (SOA) record with a Responsible Authoritative
Mailbox field instead of a Mail eXchange (MX) record. If the authoritative DNS
server for the domain in which the mail server resides is one of these
BIND-based DNS servers, the Microsoft DNS server will not return that record to
the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
