TITLE   :XADM: PerfWiz Reports Multiple Errors when Moving Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


When you run the Microsoft Exchange Performance Optimizer (PerfWiz) and attempt
to move databases to a drive that does not have adequate disk space, PerfWiz
will generate an error for every database database that it attempts to move. The
following error will be displayed:

   A file or group of files could not be moved to the destination disk X:
   because it is full - [800FF329]

and this will be followed by error messages similar to the following, one for
each database that it attempts to move:

   The destination directory X:\exchsrvr\ did not exist and could not be
   created - [800FF333]

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Part of the functionality of PerfWiz is to analyze the disk subsystem on the
Microsoft Exchange Server. During this process, you can intervene and select the
drives that the Databases will be moved to. Part of the functionality of PerfWiz
is to verify that on each of the hard disk drivess that are selected, there is
adequate disk space before it moves the databases files. If PerWiz detects
inadequate disk space, it will generate one error per database being moved. This
functionality may appear to be excessive, but it is designed to cover the cases
where these databases are being moved to different drives and, therefore, all
drives need to be checked separately.
