The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you are installing Adobe
PhotoShop 4.0.1:

   Setup has encountered a problem. Please report file='common/info01.c',
   line='253' to Microsoft Product Support.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if you are installing PhotoShop 4.0.1 from a CD-ROM
drive using real-mode CD-ROM drivers. The error message may occur when PhotoShop
4.0.1 Setup is installing the Adobe PostScript printer driver.


RESOLUTION
==========

Install a protected-mode CD-ROM driver from your original Windows 95 disks or
CD-ROM, or from the manufacturer of the CD-ROM drive.

To install a protected-mode driver for your CD-ROM drive, click Start, point to
Help, click the Index tab, type "cd-rom" (without the quotation marks), and then
double-click the "Installing" topic. Note that this method works only if your
CD-ROM drive supports a protected-mode driver included with Windows 95.

For information about determining whether Windows 95 supports your CD-ROM drive
in protected mode, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q151634 Protected-mode CD-ROM Drive Support in Windows

If Windows 95 does not include a protected-mode driver for your CD-ROM drive,
contact the manufacturer of the CD-ROM drive to determine whether a
protected-mode driver is available from the manufacturer.

If your CD-ROM drive does not support protected-mode drivers, contact Adobe for
other possible resolutions to the issue.
