The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have altered a resource script outside of the resource editor (for
example, by hand or by using a version control system), Developer Studio notices
the change and asks you if you want to reload.

If you answer yes, the reload seems to succeed and no error message appears.
However, the resource view does not reflect the changes made to the .RC file
outside of the resource editor, even if you reload it.

CAUSE
=====

The resource editor generates and uses a .APS file. This file contains a binary
format of the resources. This file is not recompiled when the resource script is
changed outside of Developer Studio. Only replacing the .RC and RESOURCE.H
resource files is not sufficient if you want the resource view to reflect the
changes made to the resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Make sure that the project is closed. Replace the .APS , .RC and RESOURCE.H
   files.

-or-

 - Make sure that the project is closed. Delete the .APS file and replace both
   the .RC and RESOURCE.H files. In this case, the project compiles a new .APS
   file that reflects the changes in the .RC file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new MFC-SDI project called MYAPP with the AppWizard.

2. In the resource editor, change the resource ID for menu item "File-New" from
   ID_FILE_NEW to ID_NEW.

3. On the File menu, select Save All.

4. Backup MYAPP.RC and RESOURCE.H from the project directory to another
   location.

5. Revert the resource ID for "File-New" to ID_FILE_NEW.

6. On the File menu, select Save All.

7. Restore the backup files MYAPP.RC and RESOURCE.H.

8. Developer Studio notices the change and asks you to reload resource. Click
   "yes".

9. Examine the Properties for menu item "File-New".

10. The resource ID for "File-New" should have been restored to ID_NEW, but it
   is still ID_FILE_NEW.

11. If you Save All, the MYAPP.RC and RESOURCE.H files will be overwritten with
   information from the MYAPP.APS file.
