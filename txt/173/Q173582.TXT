SUMMARY
=======

You may want to display Microsoft Outlook from Visual FoxPro to allow users to
read or send messages or to open other folders in Outlook. This article
demonstrates how to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Outlook object provides the functionality to control data stored in the
Outlook folders, but there is limited functionality to manipulate Outlook
itself. Since you probably want to interact with the data stored in Outlook, you
need to create a reference to the Messaging Application Programming Interface
(MAPI) folders where Outlook stores all of its information. Do this by setting a
variable to the "Namespace" object.

The following code creates and displays an instance of Outlook. Visual FoxPro for
Windows pauses execution as long as the user has the Outlook application on top
using the GetActivewindow API function call. If the Visual FoxPro application
window is brought on top, then the code forces Outlook to close:

      oOutlookObj = CREATEOBJECT("Outlook.Application")
      oNamespace = oOutlookObj.GetNamespace("MAPI")
      oFolder = oNamespace.GetDefaultfolder(6)   && See below for other values
      oFolder.Display

      * Code to pause FoxPro while Outlook window is on top
      IF NOT 'FOXTOOLS' $ SET('LIBRARY')
         SET LIBRARY TO SYS(2004)+"FoxTools"
      ENDIF
      FoxWind = MAINHWND()
      GetActive=RegFn('GetActiveWindow','','I') && Determine if FoxPro is
                                                && on top
      DO WHILE .T.    && Keep looping until the ActiveWindow = FoxWind
         IF FoxWind = CallFn(GetActive)
            EXIT
         ENDIF
      ENDDO
      SET LIBRARY TO

      oOutlookObj.Quit

The GetDefaultfolder method has several values that open different folders in
Outlook. The list below provides the default folder values.

   Folder Name      Value

   Outbox             4
   Sent Items         5
