TITLE   :ODE97: Print Command Not Available in Run-Time Applications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build a custom menu bar in Microsoft Access 97 and include the built-in
File menu, some commands do not appear on the menu in the run-time environment.
For example, the Print command does not appear on the menu; as a result, you
cannot modify the printer settings or properties.

CAUSE
=====

Some menu commands, such as the Print command from the default File menu, are
disabled in the run-time environment.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use either of the following two methods.

Method 1: Use the Command Bar Wizard
------------------------------------

You can use the Command Bar Wizard to replace the default menu bar with a custom
menu bar. For more information about obtaining the Command Bar Wizard, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q172300 ACC97: Command Bar Wizard Available in Download Center

Follow these steps to create a custom menu bar using the Command Bar Wizard:

1. Open your database in Microsoft Access 97.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Add-ins, and then click Command Bar Wizard.

3. Under Select Type in the Command Bar Wizard dialog box, click New, and then
   click Next.

4. In the Select Template list, click Database, and then click Next.

5. Click Next, and then type a name for the menu in the Menu Name box.

6. Click Build.

   NOTE: The Command Bar Wizard will create a new menu and close any existing
   menus. You can dock the custom menu bar or move it to any location on the
   screen.

7. On the Tools menu, click Startup.

8. In the Startup dialog box, type or select your menu in the Menu Bar box.

9. Click OK.

Note that the Print command is available when you open this database in the
run-time environment, either by running a Microsoft Access application installed
from disk images created with the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition or by
running Microsoft Access using the /runtime switch. When you click Print, the
Print dialog box appears.

Method 2: Call a Custom Print Function
--------------------------------------

You can create a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications function that displays
the Print dialog box and attach that function to a custom Menu Bar. To do so,
follow these steps:

1. Open your database in Microsoft Access 97.

2. In the Database window, click the Modules tab, and then click New.

3. Type the following code in the module that you just created:

         Public Function PrintOut()
            ' Attached to a custom Print command on a custom menu bar.
            ' Use the RunCommand method to display the print dialog box.

            On Error GoTo ErrorTrap

            DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdPrint
            Exit Function

            ErrorTrap:
               ' Check whether the RunCommand method was canceled.
               ' If RunCommand is canceled, it generates a trappable
               ' run-time error (2501).
               If Err.Number = 2501 Then
                  Exit Function
               Else
                  MsgBox Err.Number & vbCRLF & Err.Description
               End If

         End Function

4. On the Debug menu, click Compile Loaded Modules.

5. Save the module as basPrintFunction.

Follow these steps to create the custom menu bar:

1. On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click Customize.

2. Click the Toolbars tab, and then click New.

3. In the New Toolbar dialog box, type a name in the Toolbar name box, and then
   click OK.

4. In the Customize dialog box, click Properties.

5. In the Toolbar Properties dialog box, click Menu Bar in the Type list, and
   then click Close.

6. In the Customize dialog box, click the Commands tab, and then click New Menu
   in the Categories list.

7. Drag New Menu from the Commands box to your custom menu bar.

8. On your custom menu bar, right-click New Menu and type a name for the menu in
   the Name box. Press ENTER.

9. In the Customize dialog box, click File in the Categories box, and drag
   Custom from the Commands box to your new menu.

   NOTE: When you drag the Custom command over the name of your new menu, it will
   create a blank menu. It is on this blank menu that you should place the
   Custom command.

10. On your custom menu bar, right-click the Custom command from step 9 and type
   a command name, such as Print, in the Name box, and then click Properties.

11. In the <menu name> Control Properties dialog box, type "=PrintOut()"
   (without the quotation marks) in the On Action box, and then click Close.

12. Add any additional menu commands that you need in the same manner.

13. In the Customize dialog box, click Close.

14. On the Tools menu, click Startup.

15. In the Startup dialog box, type or select your menu in the Menu Bar box.

16. Click OK.

When you open your database in the run-time environment, either by running a
Microsoft Access application installed from disk images created with the
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools or by running Microsoft Access using
the /runtime switch, note that the Print command is now available. When you
click Print, the Print dialog box appears.

   Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb" /runtime

   Note that the custom menu bar appears when Northwind opens, but it does not
   show the Print command.
