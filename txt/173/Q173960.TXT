TITLE   :Create Renewal Request Option Grayed Out in Key Manager
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Create Renewal Request option is always grayed out in Key Manager. This
option is found when you highlight the certificate, and then click Key.

CAUSE
=====

The Create Renewal Request option is found grayed out in three different
scenarios:

 - If the certificate is valid and not yet expired.

 - If the certificate will expire within ten days. The status message will also
   indicate, "It will Expire soon."

 - If the certificate has already expired. The status message will also
   indicate, "This key has expired."

This condition will be found in all certificates that are created in Internet
Information Server (IIS) 1.0, even if the certificate is moved to an IIS version
2.0 or higher system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
