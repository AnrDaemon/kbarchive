TITLE   :WINS Replication Triggered Incorrectly

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

After you view or edit the settings in the Replication Partners dialog box of
WINS Manager, clicking OK may cause replication to start, even though it is not
the scheduled time for replication to occur. This does not happen if you click
Cancel or Close.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WINS replication should only occur when you click Replicate Now in the
Replication Partners dialog box, or at the scheduled time specified in the Push
and Pull properties.

This may occur if the "Initial replication" check box is selected in the WINS
Server Configuration dialog box. Per the Help topic, this option causes the WINS
server to replicate with partners on startup, and when replication options or
partners are changed.

In this case, clicking OK causes the replication configuration dialog box to
think that some changes may have been made and replication is triggered.
Clicking Cancel avoids this.
