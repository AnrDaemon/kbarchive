TITLE   :Cannot Send Messages Using WinPopup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a message using the WinPopup tool, you may receive one
of the following error messages:

   Messages sent through a NetWare server are limited to 38 characters. Shorten
   your message, and then try again.

   The name you specified cannot be found on the network. Check the name, and
   then try sending your message again.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages can occur when you send WinPopup messages to an invalid or
inaccessible computer name, or when you send to a computer with the same name as
the sender's user name (whether or not it is also a valid computer name on the
network).

The first error message occurs when you attempt to send a WinPopup message longer
than 38 characters.

The second error message occurs when you attempt to send a WinPopup message with
38 characters or less.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a computer naming convention such that no user name or computer name is the
same. Do not attempt to send WinPopup messages to a computer name or user name
that is the same as your current user name. If you are still having trouble
sending messages to a unique computer name or user name, check for network
connectivity to that computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
