TITLE   :XFOR: MSMI Cannot Process 256+ Character Recipient Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The Microsoft Mail Connector interchange (MSMI) will not process messages
addressed to recipients if the recipient's address exceeds 256 characters.
Typically, these messages would have been received by the Internet Mail Service
and then forwarded to the MSMI. The message will remain in the MTA queue to the
Microsoft Mail Connector. Additionally, the following errors are logged in the
Application Event log:

   Event ID 2380
   Source MSMI
   A memory access violation has occurred that prevents further processing of a
   message. The access violation that occurred is an attempt to read from
   0x632e6262. Please refer to the immediately following event(s) logged by MS
   Mail Connector Interchange for more information on the message that could not
   be processed. (Exception address: %2.)

   Event ID 2451
   Source MSMI
   MS Mail Connector Interchange has failed processing message from Exchange. The
   message is left in the delivery queue. Use the MS Exchange Administrator to
   view the details for this message or remove it from the queue. This error
   message will be logged again the next time MS Connector is restarted if the
   message is not removed from the queue.

CAUSE
=====

The MSMI is unable to parse recipient names longer than 256 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,

MORE INFORMATION

must shut down the MSMI service and then delete the item from the MTA queue
using the Exchange Administrator program.
