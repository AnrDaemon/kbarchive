TITLE   :XCLN: MS Fax and Exchange Run Slowly in Same Profile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add the Microsoft Exchange Server service to a profile already
containing Microsoft Fax, operations such as composing a new fax, startup, or
sending mail may slow down considerably. This only affects clients attaching
remotely to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer through a dial up connection.
If the client is set to work offline, this problem does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

When you open the Exchange profile or compose a new fax, Microsoft Fax is trying
to initialize the communications port. At the same time, the Exchange Server
service is trying to check for new mail, and use the communications port as
well.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set up separate profiles for Microsoft Fax and
Exchange Server.
