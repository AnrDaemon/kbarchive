SYMPTOMS
========


When you use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program's Find Recipient
command on the Tools menu, it will not indicate that processing has finished. If
the process fails to return any information, you may not be aware that the
process has completed.

MORE INFORMATION

The process will produce the results of the query in the display window. Once
complete, it will return focus to the Find Now button. If the query finds no
matches, nothing is displayed in the display window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post additional
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
