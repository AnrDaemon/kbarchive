OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA service pack level is not displayed when you use either the SNAVER
utility or you click "About SNA Server Manager" on the Help menu. Only the SNA
Server version and build numbers are displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The service pack binaries show build number, but not service pack number.

RESOLUTION
==========

Changes were made to the SNAVER utility to display the Evaluation, NFR (Not for
Resale), Workstation, and retail version numbers. Changes were also made to SNA
Server Manager's Help About dialog to display the SNA version string which is
located in the following registry subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_COMPUTER\Software\Microsoft\SNA Server\ 
   CurrentVersion\SNAVersion

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
