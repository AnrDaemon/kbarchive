SUMMARY
=======


In Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), the session timeout defaults to 60 minutes
for authenticated users and 20 minutes for anonymous users. This can be changed
using the following registry entries:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWeb\Parameters

   AuthenticatedSessionTimeout
   AnonymousSessionTimeout

Both are DWORD values and are in minutes

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
