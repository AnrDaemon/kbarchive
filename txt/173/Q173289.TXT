TITLE   :WD97: Graphic Does Not Appear or Print in a Master Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a subdocument containing a graphic into a master document, the
graphic seems to disappear and does not print.

CAUSE
=====

The graphic is formatted as Float Over Text (click Picture on the Format menu,
and then click the Position tab), and you are not in a view that displays Float
Over Text objects.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable the graphic to be displayed and printed in a master document, use one
of the following methods.

Method 1: Change Views
----------------------

On the View menu, click either Page Layout or Online Layout.

Method 2: Change Object to "Inline"
-----------------------------------

Format the graphic as an inline object by removing the Float Over Text
formatting. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open the subdocument that contains the object.

2. Select the graphic.

3. On the Format menu, click Picture.

4. Click the Position tab.

5. Click to clear the Float Over Text check box.

6. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word documents consist of separate text and drawing layers. Master
document view, normal view, and outline view do not display objects in the
drawing layers. Page layout, online layout, and print preview are the only views
that can display the drawing layers of a Word document. Floating objects reside
on one of the document's drawing layers and, therefore, are visible only in page
layout, online layout, and print preview views.

document, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
