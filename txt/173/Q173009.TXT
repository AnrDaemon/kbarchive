SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to call the RegEnumValue API from Visual Basic or Visual Basic
for Applications code, you may receive the following error:

   Error 87 - Invalid Parameter

This problem occurs if you are running the Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000
Operating Systems and you have obtained the declaration for the RegEnumValue API
from Visual Basic's API Text Viewer program.

CAUSE
=====

The Declare statement for RegEnumValue in Visual Basic's API Text Viewer is
incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

The declaration of RegEnumValue as it currently exists in the API Text Viewer
is:

      Declare Function RegEnumValue Lib "advapi32.dll" Alias "RegEnumValueA" _
         (ByVal hKey As Long, ByVal dwIndex As Long, ByVal lpValueName As _
         String, lpcbValueName As Long, lpReserved As Long, lpType As Long, _
         lpData As Any, lpcbData As Long) As Long

The fifth parameter, lpReserved, should be defined as ByVal. The correct
declaration is:

      Declare Function RegEnumValue Lib "advapi32.dll" Alias "RegEnumValueA" _
         (ByVal hKey As Long, ByVal dwIndex As Long, ByVal lpValueName As _
         String, lpcbValueName As Long, ByVal lpReserved As Long, lpType As _
         Long, lpData As Any, lpcbData As Long) As Long

You can also change the statement in the file win32api.txt so the next time you
use the API Text Viewer, the Declare statement will be correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.
