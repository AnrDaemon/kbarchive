TITLE   :WD97: Hyperlink to Anchor or Bookmark Goes to Top of Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:winword word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When loading a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that specifies a bookmark or
anchor as part of the URL, Microsoft Word 97 does not position the window at the
bookmark. For example, when loading the following URL, Microsoft Word positions
you at the top of the document instead of jumping to the bookmark location
within the document:

   http://example.microsoft.com/page.html#BookmarkName

NOTE: This problem does not exist when you jump to bookmarks in local documents.

WORKAROUND
==========

Type or insert a hyperlink with a bookmark or anchor reference in your Microsoft
Word document.

   Example: http://example.microsoft.com/page.html#BookmarkName

Although this hyperlink is in the correct format it will take you to the top of
the named page and not to the named location.

To make the hyperlink function correctly, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the hyperlink.

2. Point to hyperlink and then click Edit Hyperlink on the shortcut menu.

3. Add a # (pound sign) to the front of the bookmark name in the "Named location
   in file (optional)" area.

4. Click OK.

The hyperlink will now display a hyphen between the page name and the # and will
work correctly (it will take you to the named location in the document).

   Example: http://some.server.com/page.html - #BookmarkName

NOTE: Typing the hyphen in the URL will not work.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bookmarks (also called anchors in HTML) can be used to move to a particular
section in a document. To create a link from one document to a specific section
in another document, a named anchor or bookmark must first be created in the
second document. Now, in the first document, you can create a hyperlink to the
bookmark or anchor in the second document.
