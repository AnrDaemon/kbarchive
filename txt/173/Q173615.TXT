DOCUMENT:Q173615  13-JUN-2001  [sna]
TITLE   :Unable to Specify LU Number 1 When Adding Range of 3270 LUs
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Range of LUs wizard used by SNA Server Manager to configure a range of 3270
LUs does not allow the first LU number to be specified as 1. LU number 1 would
correspond to an LU defined as LOCADDR=001 in the PU definition in VTAM.

CAUSE
=====

The Range of LUs wizard is designed with a check to validate that the first LU
number is 2 or greater.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Create the first LU using LU number 1 individually in SNA Server Manager and
   then to use the Range of LUs wizard to create the rest of the Lus, starting
   with an LU number of 2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the Range of LUs wizard validates that the first LU number
is greater than 0 instead of 2 or greater.
