SUMMARY
=======

Page 439 of "Running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0" states that Microsoft File
and Print Servers for NetWare (FPNW) is available at no charge from Microsoft's
FTP and Web sites on the Internet. However, FPNW is currently not available on
the Microsoft Web or FTP site, or on any dial-up service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FPNW has recently been added to the Microsoft Services for Netware, part number
519-00009. Microsoft Services for Netware includes FPNW and Directory Service
for Netware.

For more information, please check the following Web site:

NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, this address may
change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft home page at the

Page 439, paragraph 3, sentence 1 reads:

   ...it is readily available at no charge from Microsoft's ftp and Web sites on
   the Internet as well as on the Microsoft Network and from other dial-up
   services.

This is incorrect.

The corrected information is:

   ...it is available by purchasing the Microsoft Services for Netware package,
   which includes Directory Service Manager for NetWare as well as FPNW."

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. This
correction is ready for inclusion in future printings of this book. If you have
a later printing of this book, it may already contain the above correction.
