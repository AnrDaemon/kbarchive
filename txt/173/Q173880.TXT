TITLE   :BUG: Page Down/Page Up Keys Do Not Clear READ MODAL in VFP5
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Page Up and Page Down keys in Visual FoxPro 5.0x no longer clear a READ
MODAL command. These keys do clear READ MODAL commands in Visual FoxPro 3.0 and
3.0b and in FoxPro 2.x versions. The Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys clear the READ
MODAL as in the earlier versions.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use an ON KEY LABEL command to trap for a Page Up or Page Down key, and then
issue a CLEAR READ. For example:

      ON KEY LABEL pgdn CLEAR READ  && or pgup to trap for the Page Up key
      x=" "
      @ 2,2 SAY "This is a test " GET x
      READ MODAL
      ON KEY LABEL pgdn  && or pgup

Upgrading to Visual FoxPro Service Pack 2 does not fix this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program called Test.prg containing the follow code:

         x=" "
         @ 2,2 SAY "This is a test " GET x
         READ MODAL

2. After running the program, press the Page Down or Page Up keys. The READ is
   not cleared. In Visual FoxPro 3.0, 3.0b and FoxPro 2.x, both the Page Up and
   Page Down keys clear the READ MODAL command.

Additional query words: READ MODAL clear page up down
