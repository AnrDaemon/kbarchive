PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Windows XP Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server (SMS) Hardware Inventory Agent client log file
(Windows\MS\SMS\Logs\Hinv32.log) on a Windows XP-based client may contain an
exception entry. The entry in the Hinv32.log file may look like the following
entry:

   

   Hardware Inventory Agent completed in 00 hours, 00 mins, 42 secs !  
   <<<<<<<<<<<<< EXCEPTION EXCEPTION EXCEPTION >>>>>>>>>>>>> 
   <<CLIEXCEPT>> (Logged to all threads) An exception was raised in the 
   application '<unknown>', thread 0x500 (<unknown>)~  
   <<CLIEXCEPT>> A fatal exception occurred in THIS THREAD. Information 
   follows:~  
   <<CLIEXCEPT>> The exception was not an MFC CException. A detailed 
   information dump will follow...~  
   ======= Logging initialized for module "Hardware Inventory Agent" =======
   Hardware Inventory Agent cycle started ..... !  

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when Hinv32.exe incorrectly shuts down its service main
thread after it completes an inventory cycle, so it is unable to handle the
exception.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Other than the exception log entry, there are no known repercussions, and the
hardware inventory is correctly sent and processed on the site server.
