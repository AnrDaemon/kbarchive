SYMPTOMS
========

You sign in to MSN Explorer 6.1 on a computer equipped with Windows XP, and you
use the account manager's user tile (the user tile associated with an MSN
Internet Access account). You quickly switch to a guest sign in, without signing
out (the dial-up connection is still active). You try to sign in to MSN Explorer
while logged in as a guest. An error message appears stating that the "modem is
not working properly or is already in use".

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - When using MSN Explorer with Window XP, you may use any MSN Explorer user
   tile, but you cannot sign in as a guest.

This issue will be resolved in a later release of MSN Explorer.
