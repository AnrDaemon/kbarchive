SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft DNS service may have problems when it acts as a secondary server
for a zone whose master is on a BIND version 9.x DNS server. Specifically, zone
transfers may not work.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because Microsoft DNS servers have a limitation of
receiving 16 kilobytes (KB) AXFR (full zone transfer) messages.
