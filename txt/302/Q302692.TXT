SUMMARY
=======

Troubleshooting Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) cobranding features is relatively
simple. When you begin troubleshooting CSS cobranding issues, first make sure
that style sheets are supported in the browser that your user is using. Some
targeted browsers do not support all aspects of style sheet cobranding. For more
information on known CSS cobranding browser-specific issues, see the following
Passport Software Development Kit (SDK) Web site:

   Passport Cobranding Style Sheets
   http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/cobrand/cobrandtemplate_css.htm

If you still have not solved your problem, review the tips that are listed in the
"More Information" section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - Make sure that your CSS style sheet is at the URL that is specified by the
   CoBrandCSSURL that you provided at registration time.

 - Many sites that use style sheets also "sniff" for browser capability. If
   browser-sniffing capability is required, build the sniffing code into the
   CoBrandCSSURL file as a script, so that different CSS-formatted text is
   returned for the style sheet based on the result of the sniffing. This
   requires that the CoBrandCSSURL actually point to an Active Server Pages
   (ASP) file or an equivalent server-side solution rather than to a fixed,
   text-only CSS file.

 - Debugging style sheets that check for the lid and cb parameters being passed
   is somewhat more complex. For more information, see the following Passport
   SDK Web site:
