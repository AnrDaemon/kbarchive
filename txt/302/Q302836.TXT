SYMPTOMS

When you configure the Advertised Programs Client Agent polling interval for new
programs in the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator Console, you
cannot set a value above 1,440 minutes (1 day). If you try to do so, you receive
the following error message:

   Please enter an integer between 5 and 1440.

This limitation also applies to the Advertised Programs Monitor on SMS clients.
You receive the following error message if you enter a value that is outside of
the range:

   The refresh interval must be between 5 and 1440 minutes.

You can configure the polling interval both on a per-client basis and on a
site-wide basis. On the client, you can use the Options command on the System
menu in the Advertised Programs Monitor tool in Control Panel to adjust this
setting.
