The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network version 6.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You sign in to MSN Explorer with the account manager account (the account
associated with a paying MSN Internet Access subscriber). You use Help And
Settings to change the password for the account. After the password has been
successfully changed, you sign out of MSN Explorer. You then click Add New User.
When asked for the account manager's password, you enter the new password for
the account manager account. This password is refused, but the old password does
allow you to add a new user. You receive "error 6".

Your offline e-mail feature is also affected. After you have changed the password
and signed out, you try to sign in to the account manager account in offline
mode (you select the Read mail offline box on the sign-up screen) with the new
password. The new password is refused, but the old password works.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue

 - Start MSN Explorer with the account manager account, using the new password.
   Note: Do not check the Read mail offline box.
   After you have signed in with the new password successfully, you will be able
   to use the new password to add new users, and to sign in to offline e-mail
   mode.
