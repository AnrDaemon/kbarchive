SYMPTOMS
========

You install MSN Explorer 6.1, specify that you have an existing MSN Internet
Access account, and then select MSN dial-up as the connection device. You enter
a Hotmail.com account (the account has been previously upgraded to a paying MSN
Internet Access account). You proceed through Setup until you reach the
Additional Information page (this page follows the page that displays access
phone numbers). You click the Back button, and you are taken back to the Enter
Account Information page. You click the Continue button, and you are taken to
the Additional Information page. The page displaying the access numbers was
skipped.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view the access numbers that are set up for your account

1. Complete Setup and then, after MSN Explorer signs you in, click the Sign Out
   button.

2. On the sign-in screen, click Connection Settings.

3. Select Changing dialing options, and then click Continue.

4. On the dialing options screen, click Continue.
   The list of access numbers will be displayed.
   Note: If you need to find access numbers for another area, follow the steps
   above, but select Change the location you're dialing from instead of Changing
   dialing options in step 3.
