MORE INFORMATION

1. Start MSN Companion.
   Note: To add a user, you must be the Master User on the MSN Companion--the
   Master User is the person who the main MSN Companion account is assigned to.

2. Click settings.
   The Top Ten Settings page appears.

3. Click add a new user to your MSN Companion.

4. Type the first and last name of the new user, and then click done.

5. Follow the directions on the new user added screen.
   Note: You will be prompted to turn off the "remember my password" feature, so
   that other users cannot log onto the master account.

6. Log off and allow the new user to log in to set up the new account
   information, by selecting a new user tile.
   MSN Companion now takes the new user online and to a page that allows the new
   user to set up an account or to retrieve mail from a Hotmail or MSN e-maIl
   account.
   If the new user selects the option for a "new account", MSN Companion will
   walk the new user through setting up a new account. This process is as
   follows:

    - New user provides types a location and occupation.

    - New user specifies agreement with the MSN Terms and Conditions.
      Note: If the new user does not "accept", the sign up will be terminated.

    - New user is prompted to enter a password.

    - New user is prompted to choose an e-mail name.
      Note: MSN Companion will provide options to assist the user or they can
      select one of their own. MSN Companion will also advise the user if the
      chosen e-mail name is already in use.

    - New user selects a user tile.

    - New user is now able to access the Internet.
      Note: If a new user selects the option to use "an existing account", MSN
      Companion will direct the user to provide the information for the existing
      account (existing e-mail address and password, and other account
      information).
