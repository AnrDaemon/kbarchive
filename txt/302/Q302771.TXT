-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You install MSN Explorer (version 6.1) on a computer that also has Internet
Explorer 5.0 and one of the following programs installed: Microsoft Office,
Microsoft Word, or Microsoft Works. You right-click the butterfly icon in the
system tray (the area next to the clock on your computer), and then click System
Information.

Note: You can also reach this screen by signing in to MSN Explorer, clicking More
Choices, clicking About MSN Explorer, and then clicking Configuration.

E-mail spellcheck is listed as installed and available, even though this feature
is not available to use.

CAUSE
=====

Internet Explorer 5.5 is not installed on the computer. The spellcheck option is
not available because it requires Microsoft Office, Microsoft Word, or Microsoft
Works and Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher. This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want spellcheck in MSN Explorer, upgrade to the latest version of
Internet Explorer at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie.
