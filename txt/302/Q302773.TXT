KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network version 6.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you read an e-mail message in MSN Explorer, Hyper-Text Markup Language
(HTML) code is visible. The HTML is the code that is the basis for Web pages; it
generally appears as code and text enclosed by brackets.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by an error in the e-mail program used to send the message.
The message gets sent as a plain text message, but in fact, the message contains
HTML code. MSN Explorer reads the message as plain text, and displays the entire
message--including the HTML code.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view the message correctly

 - Go to http://www.hotmail.com and sign in with the account name and password
   you use in MSN Explorer.
   Note: If you are using MSN Explorer to visit the Hotmail web site, signing in
   will not be necessary).
