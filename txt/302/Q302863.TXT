SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the IMC Queue Dump utility (Imcdump.exe).
Imcdump.exe is included with Exchange Server versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5. For
Exchange Server 5.5, Imcdump.exe is located in the root of the CD-ROM in the
Server\Support\Utils\<Platform> folder, where <Platform> is either
Alpha or I386. For Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0, Imcdump.exe is located
on the root of the CD-ROM in the Support\Utils\<Platform> folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Imcdump.exe displays information about the internal representation of the
Internet Mail Service queues that is stored in the Queue.dat file of the Imcdata
folder.

How to Use Imcdump.exe
----------------------

Usage: imcdump <heap-path>
INBOUND|OUTBOUND|FREELIST|HEAP|<queuename>

The <heap-path> is the path to the Queue.dat file including the file name.
By default, the path is <Homedrive>\Exchsrvr\Imcdata\Queue.dat.

For example, to dump the INBOUND queue for the Queue.dat file that is located in
the default location, run the following command from a command prompt (start
from the same folder where the Imcdump.exe file is located):

   "imcdump <homedrive>\exchsrvr\imcdata\queue.dat inbound" (without the
   quotation marks)

When you run this command, the output is displayed in the window. To dump the
output to a file, run the following command:

   "imcdump <homedrive>\exchsrvr\imcdata\queue.dat
   inbound>c:\imcdump.txt" (without the quotation marks)
