======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run a Systems Management Server (SMS) client installation by using either
Smsman.exe or Smsls.bat in a Terminal Services session, the installation does
not finish and nothing is displayed on the screen.

CAUSE
=====

SMS 2.0 requires the user to be logged on to a computer locally to install the
SMS client. Therefore, Smsman.exe and Smsls.bat do not run in a Terminal
Services session in Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows XP. There is
logic built into the installation process that prevents the installation process
from starting in a Terminal Services session, but no information appears on the
screen to notify the user that the installation process is quitting.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run the client installation process in a local
session on the workstation on which you are installing the client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
