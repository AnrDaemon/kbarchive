TITLE   :FIX: Persistent Storage Manager Disallows Access to Snapshots
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Server Appliance Kit (SAK), version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After the Reliability Framework is installed and the system rebooted, Persistent
Storage Manager (PSM) will no longer allow access to snapshots.

CAUSE
=====

The watchdog timer overwrites the registry key:

   HKYEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
   Manager\BootExecute

PSM writes the value psmready into this key, and when this value is overwritten,
PSM no longer works correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

A hotfix has been created to fix this problem. Contact your technical account
manager (TAM), OEM representative, or Microsoft Product Support Services
(http://support.microsoft.com/directory/) to obtain this hotfix.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
