TITLE   :Error Message When an Account Operator Creates a Home Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP5,4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An account operator that is using either a Terminal Server or the latest version
of User Manager from the Windows NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit to manage user
accounts may receive the following error message:

   The Home Directory. \\<UNCPATH>, <USERNAME> could not be created.
   The user Account has been updated. You must create the Home Directory
   manually

Note that this symptom occurs when you let the operating system create the home
directory for users.

CAUSE
=====

Because the initial permissions are set to only allow the administrators and the
user account full control when user manager creates the home directory, the user
who is changing the home path does not have permissions to create the Windows
and Windows\System folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

 - Use the version of Usrmgr.exe from a Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer,
   but note that administrators cannot then set WTS-specific features.

 - Use Usrmgr.exe from a domain controller.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the account operator has local administrator rights on the server that hosts
the home directory, the error message is not generated. Either way it still
creates the user home directory, but with local administrators rights, the home
directory has the Windows and Windows\System folders.
