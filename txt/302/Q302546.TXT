 - MSN Companion, version 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Point of Presence (POP) Mail (or "POP Suck") feature enables MSN Companion
to move or "suck" down your existing POP mail into the MSN Companion mailbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two scenarios:

If you already have an ISP: We will enable retrieving messages from only 1 POP
account, not multiple accounts, such as in Hotmail. The e-mail from your POP
account (such as an Earthlink POP account) is downloaded whenever you click to
go to the Inbox page, and during nightly management. After downloading, messages
are treated just like a regular Hotmail message. To configure POP Mail support,
you must enter a POP Server Name, User Name, and Password either during Setup,
or through E-Mail Settings.

[GRAPHIC:E-mail settings page.]

If you are an existing MSN Internet Access customer: We download your MSN.COM
e-mail one time only--during e-mail migration. From that point on, you need not
worry about your old e-mail account; it is automatically migrated and routed. We
will "suck" your POP account once during the Setup process. That way, the e-mail
in your msn.com POP account will appear in the Hotmail backend. From then on,
though, all e-mail to that account will go directly to Hotmail backend, so no
recurring POP "sucking" is required.
