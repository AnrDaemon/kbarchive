SYMPTOMS

You set up two administrator profiles in Windows XP. You then add a paying MSN
Internet Access subscriber to MSN Explorer on one of these administrator
profiles. You do a Fast User Switch to the other administrator profile, and then
you start MSN Explorer. The option to sign up for a MSN Internet Access account
appears. However, you cannot add any more MSN Internet Access accounts to MSN
Explorer, because MSN Explorer allows one paying MSN Internet Access subscriber
per machine.

This issue will be resolved in a future release of MSN Explorer.
