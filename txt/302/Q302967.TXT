======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Remote Control feature of Systems Management Server (SMS)
2.0 and you connect a second time to remotely control a computer that is running
Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, a blank screen may appear in place of the Windows
Logon screen. This issue occurs if the user has logged off or locked the
remotely viewed workstation between Remote Control sessions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
   Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Log on without viewing the Windows Logon screen. Although you cannot see it,
   mouse and keyboard activity is being passed to the other computer. Click the
   Gold Key button, type your credentials, and then press ENTER. The default
   desktop appears after you have logged on.

 - Stop and restart the SMS Remote Control agent service on the desktop after
   each remote control session in which you have logged off or locked the
   workstation. The Windows Logon screen appears as expected on the next remote
   control attempt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.
