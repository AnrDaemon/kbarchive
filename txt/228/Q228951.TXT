TITLE   :Midtown Madness: Panoz GTR-1 Stops Abruptly when You Hop a Curb
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Midtown Madness, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you drive the Panoz GTR-1, you may experience the following symptoms when
you attempt to hop a curb:

 - If you hit the curb at a steep angle, the GTR-1 is damaged, and the vehicle
   may stop unexpectedly.

   NOTE: If you hit the curb at a speed of 50 miles-per-hour (MPH) or greater,
   you may destroy the Panoz GTR-1.

 - If you hit the curb at a shallow angle, the GTR-1 is slightly damaged, and
   the vehicle may bounce off the curb and remain on the street.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Panoz GTR-1 has an extremely low ground
clearance and is not designed to handle street curbs and other large bumps.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this behavior from occurring, use crosswalk ramps to hop the curb, or
drive only on the street.
