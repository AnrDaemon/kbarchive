TITLE   :Socket Programs May Not Connect to Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 on your computer running Windows
NT, socket-based programs may stop responding (hang). A network trace may show
that the TCP/IP packets may not be ordered in the proper sequence.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a change in the calculations for random Initial
Sequence Numbers (ISN) used in TCP/IP packets. As a result, an ISN may be
generated that is less than the current ISN and, as a result, TCP/IP packets may
be out of sequential order.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================
