TITLE   :FTP Virtual Directory Is Not Displayed in Directory Listing

SYMPTOMS
========

A virtual directory in an FTP site cannot be seen by the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

Under the FTP site's home directory, create a physical subdirectory with the
same name as the alias of the virtual directory.

As an example, assume the FTP site is set up as follows:

 - FTP site home directory: C:\INETPUB\FTPROOT
 - Virtual directory alias: TEST
 - Physical directory associated with the TEST virtual directory: C:\FILES

Create a TEST subdirectory under the home directory. In this example, the full
path for that subdirectory is C:\INETPUB\FTPROOT\TEST.

The next time you use the FTP client to browse the FTP site, you will see TEST
listed as a directory.

When the TEST directory is opened, the contents of the physical directory
C:\FILES will actually be displayed (rather than the contents of
C:\INETPUB\FTPROOT\TEST).

Note: The names of the alias and matching physical subdirectories are NOT case
sensitive.
