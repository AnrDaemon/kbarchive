======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5, versions Build 2.573.2927, Build 2.573.3513, Build 2.573.3711 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.1, 2.1 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to issue a SQLSetPos() (UPDATE a record) on a SELECT statement
that uses table names in the field/column list, you will receive the following
error message:

   [Microsoft][ODBC driver for Oracle]Degree of derived table does not match
   column list.

A simple SELECT statement similar to the following causes the error:

   SELECT customer.customer_ID, customer.name FROM customer

Also, using alias names for the table, as in the following, also causes the
error:

   SELECT a.name FROM customer a

CAUSE
=====

This is a bug in the statement parsing routine for the Microsoft Oracle ODBC
driver.
