TITLE   :PRB: Missing /c Compiler Option Causes LNK1561 Linker Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbLinker kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling a multiple source file project that creates a pre-compiled header
file inside the Visual C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the
following error can occur:

   Compiling...
   StdAfx.cpp
   LINK : fatal error LNK1561: entry point must be defined
   Error executing cl.exe.

NOTE: The linker error is generated during the compiler phase of the build.

CAUSE
=====

The /c compiler option is missing from the build settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add /c to the compiler options. To do this, you must edit the compiler options
in the Project Options box in the C/C++ tab under Project Settings.

NOTE: This box is only editable if the whole project is selected in the tree
control on the Project Settings.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Visual C/C++ compiler attempts to compile and link in a single
step. The /c (Compile without Linking) option is used to tell the compiler to
compile only. Since Visual C++ compiles and links in separate steps, then /c is
required for all Visual C++ builds.

To reproduce the error, create a default MFC project and remove the /c option
from the Project Settings by editing the compiler options in the Project Options
box in the C/C++ tab under Project Settings.
