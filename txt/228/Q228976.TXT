RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. On the Midtown Madness startup screen, click Options.

2. Click Graphics Options.

   graphics options in the game. To do this:

    - Click to clear all check boxes.

    - Move the Far Clip Distance and Lighting Quality sliders to the left.

    - Click lower settings in the Texture Resolution, Object Detail, Resolution,
      and Shadows boxes.

4. Click Done, and then click << (Back).
