TITLE   :Err Msg: "NFS Login Failed" When Connecting to NFS Share
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Services for UNIX Add-On Pack 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Client for NFS component of Services for UNIX, whenever a
user attempts to connect to a network file system (NFS) share the following
error message is displayed:

   NFS Login Failed

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the user's NFS client credentials did not
authenticate to the UNIX network information service (NIS) server or the
personal computer network file system daemon (PCNFSD) server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, specify an existing NIS server and NIS domain, or specify
a PCNFSD server that can positively validate the NFS user and password
credentials in the Client for NFS configuration. If no NIS or PCNFSD server
exists, the client uses the Nobody/Nobody (-2/-1) UID/GID NFS credentials.

To disable the NFS login confirmation dialog box:

1. In the Client for NFS Configuration dialog box, click the Authentication tab.

2. Clear the following check boxes:

    - "Authenticate at System Logon"

    - "Display this Dialog on Connect"

    - "Display Confirmation"
