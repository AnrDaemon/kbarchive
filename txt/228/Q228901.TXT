TITLE   :XCON: Account Validation Problems with Dynamic RAS Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A Dynamic Remote Access Service (RAS) connection configured with override
account information may not authenticate. Consequently, the servers cannot bind
over remote procedure call (RPC), and may generate the following events:

   Dialing Server
   Event ID 9318
   An RPC communications error occurred. Unable to bind over RPC. Locality Table
   (LTAB) index: 5, NT/MTA error code: 1722. Comms error 1722, Bind error 0,
   Remote Server Name SREX [MAIN BASE 1 500 %10] (14)

The following events are written to the system log:

   Event ID: 5719
   Source: Netlogon
   Type: error
   No Windows NT Domain Controller is available for domain CRM. (This event is
   expected and can be ignored when booting with the 'No Net' Hardware Profile.)
   The following error occurred:
   There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request.

   Event ID 9322:
   An interface error has occurred mta bind back over rpc has failed locatility
   table 108, mta error: 1722 1722 bind error 0, remote server name... protocol
   string id-tcp:ipaddress of server.

   9316
   An RPC communications error occurred. No data was sent over the RPC
   connection. Locality table (LTAB) index: 4. Windows NT error: 0. The MTA will
   attempt to recover the RPC connection. [BASE IL KERNEL 26 512] (12)

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is empirical evidence that supports that servers handling Dynamic RAS
connectors be Windows NT backup or primary domain controllers. Member servers
handling Dynamic RAS connectors add an extra step of querying the domain
controllers for account validation. This extra step can add additional overhead,
which prevents the connection from being established, so that mail flow cannot
occur.
