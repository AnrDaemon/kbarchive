PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the SmsrunStartupDelay function in Systems Management Server 1.2, the
specified delay will not occur if the Sms.ini file is not in the root directory
of the boot drive (example: C:\).

CAUSE
=====

SmsRun16.exe is only looking for the Sms.ini file in the root directory of the
boot drive. In some instances of Systems Management Server Installations, this
file may be located in the %windir% directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Move the Sms.ini file from %windir% to C:\.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
