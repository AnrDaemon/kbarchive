SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the redirector's (Rdr.sys) registry entry for DormantFileLimit to
0, a Stop:0x0000001E blue screen error message similar to the following may be
displayed:

   STOP:0x0000001E(C0000005,0xFEF68219,0x00000000,0x00000008)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED *** Address fef68219 has base at fef55000 -
   rdr.sys.

The addresses may vary.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occrus because Windows NT 4.0 throws an unhandled access violation
when attempting to push a context record that does not exist. This unhandled
access violation occurs in kernel mode (because it is in Rdr.sys), which causes
Windows NT to trap with a Stop 0x0000001E error message.
