TITLE   :Null in First Byte of [Input] String When 'Pad With Blanks' Spec
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The first byte of an input string is 0x00 and the rest of the string is padded
with EBCDIC blanks, that is, 0x40. In the COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI)
component library, the parameter is of the 'String' automation type, and the
corresponding COBOL definition is PIC X(n), where n is the length of the string.
The parameter's "COBOL Definition" properties have the "Pad with spaces" check
box selected to specify that the string delivered to the host is to be padded on
the right with spaces by COMTI runtime.

CAUSE
=====

When the pointer to the string in the client application code is NULL, or if it
points to a zero-length string, COMTI runtime treats the variable as if a NULL
terminator is present. If the string is not variable length, the null is then
padded with spaces to the full length of the string as defined in the component
library.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
