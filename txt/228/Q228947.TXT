-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a race in Midtown Madness, cloud shadows or snow textures on the
ground may flicker or appear as triangular shapes.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a video adapter based on one of the following chip
sets is installed in your computer:

 - 3Dfx Voodoo2
 - 3Dfx Vodoo Banshee
 - nVIDIA Riva 128
 - nVIDIA Riva TNT

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use the control software for your video adapter to
disable MipMapping. For information about how to do this, please see the printed
documentation or online Help file for your video adapter.

To resolve this issue, download and install the latest version of the video
driver for your video adapter.

For a list of links to video adapter manufacturers, please visit the appropriate
following Web site for your video adapter chip set.

If an STB Velocity 128, STB Velocity 4400, or STB BlackMagic 3D video adapter is
installed in your computer, download and install the latest version of the video
driver for your video adapter from the following STB Systems Web site:

NOTE: Certain Diamond video driver installation programs may replace the
Comctl32.dll file on your computer with a version that is incompatible with
Internet Explorer 5. If a video adapter manufactured by Diamond Multimedia is
installed in your computer and Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed on
your computer, you may need to restore the Comctl32.dll file after you install
the latest version of the video driver.
