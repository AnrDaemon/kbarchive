TITLE   :Zone Transfers Are Incomplete When Deleting a Delegation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you delete a delegation from the parent zone on the primary Domain Name
System (DNS) server, secondary DNS servers do not receive the change in the next
zone transfer or in any subsequent transfers.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because deleting the delegation does not increment the
Start of Authority (SOA). If a record is added to the parent zone to force an
SOA increment, the change is still not sent in the zone transfer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually delete the delegation from the DNS zone
file on any secondary DNS servers:

1. Stop the DNS server service on the secondary DNS server.

2. Locate the %SystemRoot%/System32/Dns folder.

3. Open the the zone file (for example, filename.com.dns) in Notepad.

4. Delete the NS and A records for the delegation.

5. Save the zone file with the same name.

6. Restart the DNS server service.

NOTE: You can also simply delete the zone file and allow a new zone transfer
containing the updated zone information to occur.

STATUS
======
