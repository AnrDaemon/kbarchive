TITLE   :Policy Editor Does Not Read SNMP Communities Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) communities are enhanced in Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 4 to include permissions for communities. Policy Editor
(Poledit.exe) cannot read these permissions or community names correctly because
of changes made in the registry to support community security.

CAUSE
=====

Because Policy Editor reads all of the necessary registry entries at startup and
then writes all of the entries when saved, whether the entry was changed or not,
the SNMP configuration information was removed from Policy Editor to prevent the
SNMP communities from being written in the previous format and because the SNMP
configuration is not a policy.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
