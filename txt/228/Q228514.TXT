KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdisplay kbui kbimu msgamekbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Baseball 2000, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to play Microsoft Baseball 2000, the game may not start and you
may be returned to the Windows desktop.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

 - A Matrox Millennium or Matrox Mystique 220 video adapter is installed in your
   computer.

 - The 3D Hardware graphics option is enabled in Baseball 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, disable the 3D Hardware graphics option in Baseball 2000.
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Baseball 2000.

2. On the Home Plate screen, click Options.

3. Click the Graphics tab.

4. Under Video Card, click Software.

5. Click OK.

NOTE: If a Matrox Millennium video adapter is installed in your computer, you
must select the Software graphics option because Baseball 2000 detects the
Matrox Millennium as a 3D video adapter and enables the 3D Hardware graphics
option by default.
