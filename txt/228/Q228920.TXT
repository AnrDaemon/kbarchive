TITLE   :Citrix ICA Connected Client File Access is Slow the First Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Citrix ICA-connected client gains access to a file on a client-mapped
drive for the first time, the access time may be very slow. Subsequent usage of
that client-mapped drive behaves as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Citrix ICA client-mapped drive is not listed in
MupPrefixTable when the connection to the file is made. Therefore, Mup.sys tries
to reconcile this by searching for the specified server first through the Pkt
table, and then through the network devices. This process can be slow in some
configurations.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition service pack that
contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
