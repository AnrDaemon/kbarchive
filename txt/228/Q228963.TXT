KEYWORDS:kbui kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Midtown Madness, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a Checkpoint Race in Microsoft Midtown Madness, the finish line may
not appear on the screen, even though your opponents are stopped where the
finish line should be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you miss a checkpoint in the race.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the directional arrow that is displayed on the
upper-middle portion of the game screen to drive to the checkpoint you missed,
and then return to the finish line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because you do not have to follow a specific route in Midtown Madness Checkpoint
Races, you can pass the race checkpoints in any order you want. However, you are
not notified if you miss a particular checkpoint.

Additional query words: 1.00 midmad mid-town missing end finishline check-point
