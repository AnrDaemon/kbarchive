SYMPTOMS
========

After you change then try to gain access to a different disk cartridge on a
drive that supports removeable media, a STOP 0x1e error message may be displayed
if the disk is formatted as NTFS.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because NTFS has code to detect if media has been switched
without being properly dismounted. This code contained a bug that caused this
blue screen error message to be displayed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Caution should be taken when changing removable media. By design, NTFS issues a
lock command to the drive to prevent removeable media from being ejected without
being properly dismounted. Some removble drives do not support this function and
some third-party utilities may not work correctly allowing the media to be
removed without properly dismounting.
