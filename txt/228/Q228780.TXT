SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the General Manager tool included with
Microsoft Baseball 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The General Manager tool is a program included with Microsoft Baseball 2000 you
can use to create and modify customized player databases based on the default
Baseball 2000 database. You can use General Manager to make the following
changes in the game database:

 - Pick up free agents.
 - Release players.
 - Edit player ratings and characteristics.
 - Create players.
 - Trade players.
 - Modify default team lineups.

To enable General Manager to find the default database, run Baseball 2000 at
least once before you start General Manager for the first time. If you do not do
this, General Manager cannot find the database.

To start General Manager, click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft
Games, point to Baseball 2000, and then click General Manager.

After you customize the Baseball 2000 database, you must save your changes before
you quit General Manager to use the customized database in Baseball 2000.

NOTE: General Manager requires exactly 25 players in each team roster. You cannot
save the database unless all team rosters contain exactly 25 players.

To save a customized database, follow these steps:

1. On the main General Manager screen, click Save.

2. In the File Name box, type a new name for your database, and then click
   Save.

   NOTE: If you do not type a new name for your database, you may overwrite the
   default Baseball 2000 database (the 1999 MLB Roster.sdb file) installed on
   your hard disk.

3. Click Close to quit General Manager.

If you overwrite the default Baseball 2000 database and you want to restore it,
you can remove and reinstall Baseball 2000, or you can copy the database file
from the Baseball 2000 CD-ROM. To copy the database file from the CD-ROM, follow
these steps:

1. Insert the Baseball 2000 CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down
   the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the program from starting
   automatically.

2. Start General Manager.

3. Click Open.

4. In the File Name box, type the following line, and then click Open

   <cd-rom>:\game\data\stats\master

   where <cd-rom> is the letter of the CD-ROM drive.

5. Click the Master.sdb file, and then click Open.

6. Click Save.

7. In the File Name box, type the following line (including the quotation
   marks), and then click Save

   "<drive>:\program files\microsoft games\baseball
   2000\data\stats\master"

   where <drive> is the letter of the hard disk on which Baseball 2000 is
   installed.

8. In the File Name box, type "1999 MLB Roster.sdb" (without the quotation
   marks), and then click Save.

9. When you are prompted to overwrite the file, click OK.

10. Click Close to quit General Manager.
