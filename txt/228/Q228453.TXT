TITLE   :NBTSTAT -RR Does Not Increment Version IDs on the WINS Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 introduces a new feature in Nbtstat.exe. When you
run the NBTSTAT -RR command at a command prompt, the names of the WINS client
can be re-registered in the WINS database. This feature does not correctly
increment the version IDs of these registered names.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the WINS client did not wait for a response to the
release request before sending the refresh request to the WINS server.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
