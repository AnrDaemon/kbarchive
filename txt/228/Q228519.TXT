SUMMARY
=======

BackOffice Small Business Server (SBS) 4.5 provides custom Internet
communications settings during the installation of SBS client computers. The
Setup Computer Wizard uses the Install.ins template source file to set custom
options and configuration settings in Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5
during client installation.

By default, when Internet Explorer 5 is installed on a client computer, the
automated client Setup process configures the browser with custom settings for
SBS as follows:

 - Adds the following pages to your collection of favorites:

    - Microsoft Small Business Web site
      http://www.microsoft.com/smallbiz

    - My Internet Home Page
      http://<sbsserver>

    - My Intranet Home Page
      http://<sbsserver>/intranet

    - SBS User Guide
      http://<sbsserver>/intranet/sbsclienthelp/default.asp

 - Changes your home page to the SBS User Guide page when you first start
   Internet Explorer.

 - Configures your client computer to use the SBS computer as a proxy server for
   Internet access, configuring all protocols to use and address of
   http://<sbsserver> and port 80.
