TITLE   :XFOR: Event ID 115 Error Starting SMTP Relay Host Service

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Option Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the SMTP Relay Host service in the Microsoft
Management Console (MMC) for Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP), the following error
message may appear in the NT application log:

   Event ID: 115
   Source: SMTPSVC
   Description: Service could not bind instance 1. The data is in the error.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a service or program is using port 25. For example,
some third-party e-mail programs that send and receive mail on behalf of another
program may be utilizing this port. In addition, some anti-virus programs listen
over port 25 and scan all incoming and outgoing e-mail messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine whether another program and or service is using port 25, type
"netstat -an" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt, and then press
ENTER.

A list of all available ports and their states (listening or active) is
displayed. If there is an entry for port 25 and you are not able to start the
SMTPSVC Relay Host service, this likely the program causing the problem. Stop
the appropriate service and then try to start the SMTP Relay Host service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Transport Control Protocol (TCP) ports cannot be multiplexed or used more than
one time in a session. You must stop one service from using a port before
another service or program can use it.
