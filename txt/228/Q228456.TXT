TITLE   :Unnecessary Dialog Appears When Configuring TCP/IP to Use DHCP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to configure TCP/IP to use both Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) and Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for Internet Protocol
(IP), the following message may be displayed:

   RIP Routing requires static IP addresses. Do you want to reconfigure your IP
   address?

This message incorrectly states that RIP for IP will only function with a static
IP address. In fact, Silent RIP functions correctly when using a DHCP-assigned
IP address.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

For information on obtaining the individual software update, contact Microsoft
Product Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support
Services phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, click NO when the dialog box appears.
Alternatively, you can configure TCP/IP to use DHCP before installing RIP for
IP.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you click NO when installing RIP for IP, the installation will still complete
successfully. Some unattended installation methods are unable to work around
this dialog box. In these cases, installing the hotfix could be necessary.

For more information on Silent RIP features included with SP4, please see the
