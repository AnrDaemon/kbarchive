TITLE   :Inappropriate Use of Trailing FILLER with an Array
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A parameter with trailing bytes of FILLER specified is declared as an array. The
specified amount of FILLER follows the array as a whole, rather than each
element of the array, as might be expected. This can be demonstrated by
exporting COBOL statements from this component.

CAUSE
=====

You can use Component Builder (CB) to specify that a parameter, declared as an
array, has trailing bytes of FILLER. Trailing FILLER is declared with the COBOL
Definition tab of the parameter's Properties page. (Arrays are declared with the
Arrays tab.) The number of bytes of FILLER to be transmitted From Host or To
Host (or both) are also specified. This implies that a COMTI run-time version
would treat it like the following example in COBOL:

      10 GROUP-ARRAY OCCURS y TIMES.
         15 ELEMENT PIC x.
         15 FILLER  PIC x.

However, run-time version actually treats it as the following COBOL:

      10 ELEMENT PIC x OCCURS y TIMES.
      10 FILLER  PIC x.

In other words, the FILLER will trail the array, rather than each element of the
array.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you do have an array and each element has FILLER following it, then the item
description must be treated as a recordset with one column. Declare a recordset
with the element and its trailing FILLER. Declare the parameter with the
recordset as its data type. Then set the parameter's array properties.

You can also use the COBOL Import Wizard, which correctly handles importing
either of the above COBOL samples.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0. It is not a bug. You must be aware of
the circumstances under which this behavior occurs because it relates to the
accurate disposition of data both to and from the mainframe server application.
