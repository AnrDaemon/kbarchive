======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An FMI application may fail with unusual error codes (e.g. Err1:000F and
Err2:0003) when it receives an OPEN SSCP RSP ERROR response from SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the resource location code inside the DMOD. The SNA Server
DMOD receives OPEN requests from the application and sends the requests to each
SNA Server service respectively. For this to occur, the DMOD has to intercept
OPEN responses from the SNA Server services. The DMOD performs an invalid test
to determine whether or not an OPEN message is a response. The test does not
allow for OPEN PLU CONF OK and CONF ERR messages.

The DMOD treats the OPEN PLU CONF OK and CONF ERR messages as if they were OPEN
error responses. This causes the DMOD to look into its queue of pending open
requests from the application, and by chance, it finds a match. In turn, the
DMOD returns the OPEN SSCP RSPERR with unusual error codes like Err1:000F and
Err2:0003.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 SP1,
2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
