TITLE   :PRB: "Set Next Statement" Does Not Work During SQL Debugging
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbEEdition kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When debugging a Microsoft SQL Server stored procedure using MSDEV IDE, the "Set
Next Statement" option does not work correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design. "Set Next Statement" is not supported for SQL debugging.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the debugger stops at a statement in the stored procedure, if you move the
insertion point to a new statement and click the "Set Next Statement" option,
the debugger does not move to the new statement.


During SQL debugging, SQL server indicates what the next statement will be. The
debugger doesn't have the same information that it receives from native debug
information (.pdb, and so on) during C++ debugging. Skipping SQL statements may
cause unpredictable results so this option is not implemented.
