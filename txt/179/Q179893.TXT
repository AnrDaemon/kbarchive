SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Outlook Web Access version 5.5 and try to forward or reply to a
message that has no recipients on the TO: line but does have recipients on the
BCC: line, the following error message may appear:

   Failed to Send Message.

The message will not be sent to the intended recipients but will be sent to
everyone on the BCC: line.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this behavior, add someone to the TO: line before forwarding the
message.
