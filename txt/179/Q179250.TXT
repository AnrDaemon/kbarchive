PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbCtrlCreate kbVBp kbVBp500bug kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport kbControl kbO

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Line or Shape controls are placed on a UserControl whose Backstyle property
is set to Transparent, the controls do not appear. This problem occurs only on
machines running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me.

RESOLUTION
==========

Setting the BorderWidth property to a value greater than the default setting of
1 allows the Line control to be drawn properly. This workaround applies only to
the Line control. There is no workaround for the Shape Control at this time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX Control project on a computer running Windows 95 or
   Windows 98.

2. Add a line control to UserControl1.

3. Add a shape control (rectangle) to UserControl1.

4. Set the Backstyle property of UserControl1 to "Transparent."

5. Set the Backstyle property of the Shape Control to "Transparent."

6. Close UserControl1's window.

7. Add a Standard EXE project (select "Add Project" from the "File" menu).

8. Place the UserControl on Form1 and note that Neither the Line nor the Shape
   Control are visible.

9. Run the project and note that the line and Shape Control are still not
   visible.
