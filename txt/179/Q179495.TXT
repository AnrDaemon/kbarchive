SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Date And Time on the Insert menu, you may see different date
formats under Available Formats within the same or different Word documents.

For example, if you place your insertion point at a place in the document, and
then click Date And Time on the Insert menu, you may see the following list:

   1/5/98
   Monday, January 05, 1998
   January 5, 1998
   1/5/1998
   1998-01-05
   5-Jan-98
   1.5.98
   Jan. 5, 98
   5 January, 1998
   January, 98
   Jan-98

NOTE: The month appears BEFORE the day in most of the dates in this list (like
United States dates).

If you place your insertion point at another place in your document, click Date
And Time on the Insert menu, you may see the following list:

   05/01/98
   Monday, 05 January 1998
   05 January 1998
   05/01/1998
   1998-01-05
   5-Jan-98
   05.01.98
   05 Jan. 98
   5 January, 1998
   January 98
   Jan-98

NOTE: The day appears BEFORE the month in most of the dates in this list (like
European dates).

CAUSE
=====

You will see different date and time formats in the Date And Time dialog box on
the Insert menu if the text has been formatted with different Language character
settings.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, change the Language character setting to the same
language in the entire document. To do so, follow these steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Language, and click Set Language.

3. Select a Language, like English (United States), and then click OK.
