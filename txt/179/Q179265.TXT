TITLE   :XADM: Event 7011 Occurs When Shutting Down Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The computer running Microsoft Exchange Server shuts down slowly (10-15 minutes)
and the following event is written in the event log:

   ID 7011 - Service control manager - Timeout(120000 ms)
   waiting for transaction response.

This has been seen on both Alpha and Intel platforms.

When ARCserve is installed on an Exchange Server computer, these symptoms can
occur. If the ARCserve services are terminated manually, Exchange Server will
shut down normally and the Event 7011 does not occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, terminate the ARCserve services manually before
shutting down the server.


To work around this issue, remove ARCserve from the Exchange Server computer or
terminate the ARCserve services manually before shutting down the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
