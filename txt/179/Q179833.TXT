TITLE   :WD97: Menu Bar Fails to Hide in Full Screen Mode
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are in full-screen mode (on the Edit menu, click Full Screen), the Word
menu bar fails to automatically hide after activating and closing an inserted
OLE object.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, close and re-enter full-screen mode.

To turn off full-screen mode and switch to the previous view, click Close Full
Screen on the Full Screen toolbar or press ESC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display as much of your document as possible on the screen, you can switch to
full-screen mode. In this mode, Word removes distracting screen elements, such
as toolbars and scroll bars.

NOTE: If you want to choose menu commands in full-screen mode, rest the pointer
at the top of the document window, and the menu bar appears. For example, you
may want to set options on the View tab (Tools menu, Options command) to specify
which screen elements to display in full-screen mode.

Additional query words: autohide view
