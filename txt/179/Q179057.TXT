TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange-Notes Dirsync Fails with Truncated Person Doc
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Directory synchronization between Microsoft Exchange Server and Lotus Notes, via
Linkage Message/Directory Exchange, fails to completely propagate the address
list into the Exchange Directory.

CAUSE
=====

When the Linkage Directory Exchange Agent encounters a Lotus Notes person
document that has a missing or blank attribute (that is, fullname, domain), the
process halts at that point and does not continue to process the remaining
transactions, even though they are valid.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix described below in the STATUS section. The Linkage Directory
Exchange Agent will now detect and skip over a Lotus Notes person document that
does not contain the required fields and will continue processing the rest of
the transactions. The transactions that failed are noted in the Linkage browse
log.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Linkage Message Exchange version
3.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Contact
Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
