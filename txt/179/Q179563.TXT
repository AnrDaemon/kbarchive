TITLE   :SMS: WinNT UDP Remote Control Fails with Security Context Lost
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server administrator tries to use Remote Control on a
Windows NT client with IP as the protocol, keyboard and/or mouse functionality
on the client computer may be lost.

CAUSE
=====

The security context can be lost. The user on the Windows NT client who is being
viewed thinks there was a normal disconnect, but the viewer still thinks the
session is active. The viewer keeps sending information, but Systems Management
Server Remote Control Agent (Wuser32.exe) on the client reads and discards it
because it has a bad context. Remote Control Agent does not send any updates to
the viewer because it considers the session to have ended.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
