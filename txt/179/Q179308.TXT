SUMMARY
=======

To verify that the Microsoft Exchange Server online backup contains a usable
copy of the database, perform the following steps:

1. Perform an online backup.

2. Set up a test server and restore the backup.

3. Stop the Exchange services.

4. For Exchange Server version 4.0 and 5.0, defrag the databases and verify that
   no errors are reported when you run the following commands:

    - edbutil /d /ispriv

    - edbutil /d /ispub

    - edbutil /d /ds

   For Exchange Server version 5.5, perform an integrity check of the databases
   and verify that no errors are reported when you run the following commands:

    - eseutil /g /ispriv

    - eseutil /g /ispub

    - eseutil /g /ds

5. Restart the services.

If the services start at this point, the database is usable and contains no
errors.
