MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have installed Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 (SP2), the following
instructions will not work. You must install Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 3
(SP3). The instructions will also work with Visual Studio 97 and Visual C++
version 5.0 without SP2.

1. Create a new AppWizard (.exe) project. For this example, we will name the
   project RDC. This example also uses the "StdReg32.mdb" database file, from
   the Enroll tutorial. This sample assumes you have registered the "Student
   Registration" database as described in the Enroll tutorial. (See the
   InfoViewer topic "The Tutorial Example: Enroll" for more information)

2. In the MFC AppWizard Step 1, select Dialog Based, click Finished, and click
   OK on the New Project Information dialog box.

3. From the Project menu, click "Add to projects", and then select "components
   and controls". Select the "Registered ActiveX Controls" folder. Select
   "Microsoft RemoteData Control version 5.0" (RDC), and click Insert. Click OK
   on the "Insert this component" dialog box. Then click OK on the "Confirm
   Classes" dialog box.

4. Use the same method to insert "Microsoft Masked Edit Control, version 5.0".
   Close the "Components and Controls Gallery" dialog box.

5. Bring the Application Dialog (IDD_RDC_DIALOG) box into the resource editor.
   Delete the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons, and the "TODO" static text.

6. Select the "Microsoft RemoteData Control" (RDC) from the control panel. If
   the control panel is not mapped, right-click a gray area to the right of the
   Microsoft Developer Studio menu and tool buttons and click "controls."

7. Insert the RDC into the dialog box. Insert a static text control below it and
   label it "Course." Insert a "Microsoft Masked Edit Control" (MEC) to the
   right of the Course static text control. Insert two more static text controls
   and MEC's below the first pair. Label the static text controls "Title" and
   "Hours."

8. Right-click the RDC and select "Properties." Pin down the Properties dialog
   box. Select the Control tab. In the DataSource list, select "Student
   Registration." In the SQL edit box type "select * from course" (don't include
   the quotes).

9. In the Dialog Editor, select the course MEC. In the Properties dialog box,
   click the All tab. The DataSource Property Value shows "<Not bound to
   DataSource>." Use the drop-down list box to select the RDC you inserted
   into the dialog box. (IDC_REMOTEDATACTL1 if you took the default name) Change
   the DataField property to CourseID. Do the same for the title and hours MEC's
   (except set the dataFields to "CourseTitle" and "Hours").

10. Build the application and test it. You should now be able to navigate the
   Course table.
