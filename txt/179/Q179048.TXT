TITLE   :XADM: Mailbox Cleanup Deletes Calendar, Contacts, and Notes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you use Mailbox Cleanup in the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program. Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Journal, and Task
information in Outlook is deleted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the Outlook client program stores Contact and
Calendar information as message files. The Clean Mailbox functionality of the
Administrator program cannot differentiate between Outlook's special folder
messages and normal mail messages. It will clean ALL messages, based on message
size or message age only.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Administrator program in Microsoft Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5,
you cannot specify from which folders messages meeting the selected criteria
will be deleted. With the fixes described in this article, the Tools/Clean
Mailbox feature has been extended to include the check box Only delete mail
messages. With this box selected(default), the Clean Mailbox feature will not
remove Outlook special folders. If this box is unchecked, Clean Mailbox will
clean all messages that fit the age criteria, including Calendar appointments,
Contacts, and so on.
