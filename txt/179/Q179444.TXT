TITLE   :Error Message: NetWare Authentication Failure
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to a Novell NetWare server using Client Services for
NetWare (CSNW), you may receive the following error message:

   NetWare Authentication Failure

   You cannot be authenticated on <server> due to the following reason:
   A connection to the server could not be made because the limit on the
   number of concurrent connections for this account has been reached.

   Do you want to select another preferred server?

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you log in to a computer that has remote access
service (RAS) Autodial Manager service enabled, log out of Windows NT, and then
immediately log back in without restarting the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, disable the RAS Autodial Manager service. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Services.

2. Click Remote Access Autodial Manager, and then click Startup.

3. Click Disabled, click OK, and then click Close.

If you are using hardware profiles, this service can be disabled in a specific
profile. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Services.

2. Click Remote Access Autodial Manager, and then click HW Profiles.

3. Click the appropriate profile, and then click Disable.

4. Click OK, and then click Close.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue occurs when the previous preferred server connection is not closed
because the Logon User ID (LUID) for the previous user is not released when the
user logs off. This can occur when the RAS Autodial Manager service impersonates
the user and uses the LUID.

The previous logon is not released because its LUID has a reference counter that
is incremented when the user's credentials are impersonated (used) and
decremented when the impersonation is released.

When the reference count for an LUID reaches 0, the kernel notifies the Local
Security Authority (LSA) that the user has logged out. The LSA then notifies
CSNW to disconnect the user's preferred connection to the Novell NetWare server.
When the RAS Autodial Manager is enabled, the LUID for the user that is
currently logged in is not decremented to 0. Therefore, the LSA is not notified
when the user logs out.
