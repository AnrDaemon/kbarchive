 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a drawing object or text box, or insert a graphic as Float Over
Text and change the text wrapping from None to Tight or Through and then back to
None, the object is placed behind the text.

CAUSE
=====

By design, when an object's wrapping is set to Tight or Through, Word
automatically places the object behind text. When an object's wrapping is set to
None, Word does not affect the placement in relation to the text.

Because the object's placement is set to Tight or Through (behind text), and then
back to None, the object's placement will remain behind the text.

WORKAROUND
==========

To change the object placement to above the text, follow these steps:

1. Select the object.

2. On the Drawing toolbar, click Draw.

3. Point to Order and click Bring in Front of Text.
