SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95 using the Compact
installation option, some scenery areas are not listed in the airports
directory.

CAUSE
=====

The missing scenery areas are part of the City Pack. The City Pack is not
installed when you use the Compact installation option.

To resolve this issue, remove Flight Simulator and then reinstall Flight
Simulator using the Typical or Custom installation options. To do so, use the
following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95 and then click Add/Remove.

4. Click Remove All.

5. When you are prompted to confirm the removal of Flight Simulator 95, click
   Yes.

6. When you are prompted to restart Windows, do so.

7. Close Control Panel.

8. Delete the folder in which Flight Simulator is installed. By default, Flight
   Simulator is installed in the following folder:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator

   For information about how to delete folders, click Start, and then click Help.
   On the Index tab, type "deleting" (without the quotation marks), and then
   double-click the "Deleting files or folders" topic.

9. Insert the Flight Simulator CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. If Auto Insert
   Notification is enabled, Setup begins automatically. Follow the instructions
   on the screen.

   NOTE: If Setup does not begin automatically, click Start, click Run, type the
   following line in the Open box, and then click OK

   <drive>:\setup.exe

   where <drive> is the letter of the CD-ROM drive.

10. When you are prompted to select the installation option you prefer, click
   Typical or Custom. If you click Custom, make sure the City Pack check box is
   selected, and then click Continue.

All of the scenery areas should now be listed in the airports directory.
