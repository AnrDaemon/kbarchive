PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you are using the Japanese localized version of
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. If an e-mail message is sent to a custom
recipient on Exchange Server and is not delivered because of an error in the
custom recipient's address, no non-delivery report (NDR) is ever generated and
returned to the original sender.

This problem occurs when the Allow Rich Text In Messages option is selected for
that custom recipient.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Clear the Allow Rich Text In Messages option. This will allow NDRs to be
   generated successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
