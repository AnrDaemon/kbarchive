TITLE   :XADM: IS Stops in _mapises\notifysrv.cxx During Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store crashes during shutdown. The
call stack is similar to the following:

   FramePtr  RetAddr   Param1   Param2   Param3   Function Name
   0179ffa0  0046d831  00000000 0110f680 0179ffec
   STORE!ScanForOutstandingNotifications+0xe3
   (FPO: [ebp 00000005] [0,2,4]) [ notifsrv.cxx @ 713 ]

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Information Store has freed the shared block of memory and set the
global pointer for it to NULL (allocated for use with the NT Performance Monitor
data) before this notification thread has been shutdown. Once this thread
attempts to access this block of memory using the NULL pointer, an access
violation occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Release the memory and free the pointer only after the notification thread
   has completely shutdown.

NOTE: Service Pack 1 must be applied to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 prior to
applying this fix.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
