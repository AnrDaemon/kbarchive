DOCUMENT:Q179479  10-AUG-1999  [foxpro]
TITLE   :PRB: Problems with Error 2004 and 2005 Commands
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the ERROR command with either error number 2004 or 2005 produces a blank
dialog box instead of the proper error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message for error number 2004 should return the following message:

   The table file "name" has moved. Please validate database "name" and try
   again.

The error message for Error number 2005 should return the following message:

   Error with "name" - "property": "error".

If you attempt to pass the two error numbers listed above more than one
parameter, you receive a syntax error message.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Activate the Command window and type the following commands:

   " ERROR 2004
   ERROR 2005" (without the quotation marks)

2. Blank dialog boxes appear.

3. If you pass more than one variable to the ERROR command for error numbers
   2004 or 2005, a syntax error occurs. For example, a syntax error occurs if
   you type the following in the FoxPro Command window because you want to
   represent a table and a database name for error 2004:

         ERROR 2004, "Customer","Testdata"
