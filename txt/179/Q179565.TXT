TITLE   :SMS: Unable To Generate Traps For Dr. Watson Events
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSNMP smssnmp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Systems Management Server SNMP Trap Translator to monitor Dr.
Watson traps, the Windows NT Application Event Log may fill up with error
message 3006 events. This causes the Windows NT Application Event Log to fill up
and overwrite older data.

CAUSE
=====

An application on the server stops responding, which causes a Dr. Watson message
to be written to the event log. The data portion of this Dr. Watson Event Log
message is very large. The SNMP Event Log Extension Agent (SNMPELEA) tries to
read the message to determine whether the message is something that it should be
trapping on. Because SNMPELEA does not provide a buffer large enough to hold the
Dr. Watson Event Log message, it generates an error 3006.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
