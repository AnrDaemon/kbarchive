TITLE   :XFOR: ICS: "Cant" Misspelling Is Per RFC-1459
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Commercial Internet System version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a user is connected to the Microsoft Internet Chat server and sends a mode
command the user is not able to execute upon another user, the following error
message will be displayed:

   -server error
   :server 502 nick1 :Cant change mode for other users

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Chat Server, version
2.0. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some administrators may note the misspelling of "Cant", which should be
"Can't".

This misspelling occurred in the actual IRC RFC-1459 and has been adopted by all
current IRC2 servers. The Microsoft Internet Chat Server must use the same
misspelling in order to maintain compatibility.

This behavior is by product design.
