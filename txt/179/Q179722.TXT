TITLE   :XCLN: Internet User Cannot Display Form Sent via Mail Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange user tries to send an electronic form over the Internet Mail
Connector or Internet Mail Service to an Internet user, the recipient may not be
able to display the form correctly. When the recipient attempts to open the
electronic form, it may not be displayed, or the user may receive the following
error message:

   Correctly displaying this item requires a custom form that is
   either not available or not correctly installed. Please see
   your network administrator for more information.

WORKAROUND
==========

Two settings must be implemented in order to send electronic forms over the
Internet Mail Connector or Internet Mail Service. Both settings involve enabling
Rich Text Format (RTF).

1. On the sending Exchange Server computer's Administrator program, go to
   Internet Mail Service, Internet Mail property page, Advanced Options. Confirm
   that the "Send Microsoft Exchange rich text formatting" option is set to
   "Always" or at least "User". If this value is set to "Never", Exchange users
   will not be able to send electronic forms over the Internet. In Exchange 5.0
   and 4.0, this setting is in the Internet Mail property page and
   Interoperability button.

2. From the Exchange client, create personal address book entries for those SMTP
   (Internet) recipients you intend to send electronic forms to. Make sure to
   enable "Always send to this recipient in Microsoft Exchange rich text
   format".

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you send an electronic form, always send it in Rich Text Format. This sends
all messages in an Application/MS-TNEF format that works fine if you are sending
to a system that understands this MIME type, usually another Internet Mail
Connector.

In Exchange Server 5.0, you must change the POP3 Protocol. Select Protocols,
double-click POP3, and click the Message Format Tab. Click the check box next to
Use Microsoft Exchange Rich-Text Format. Click OK.
