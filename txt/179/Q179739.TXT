======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0 SP2, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you are using the message transfer agent (MTA) in
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 post SP4 (build 996.46), or the MTA in
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 SP2, or version 5.5.

You do not receive T.61 (Teletex) extended characters (French accents) in
messages received by the Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) post SP4
(996.46). This applies also to users "behind" this Exchange server, like
Microsoft Mail users connected by the Microsoft Mail Connector interchange
(MSMI). The problem is only with Exchange Server MTAs receiving messages.
Foreign MTAs receiving the messages are not affected.

STATUS
======

version 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) with build 996.46 of the MTA. This problem has
been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server
