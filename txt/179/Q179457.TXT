SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Copy To Word feature in Microsoft Bookshelf 98, the footnote
number may be displayed on the line beneath the pasted text.

NOTE: The Copy To Word feature is not included in Microsoft Bookshelf 99.

CAUSE

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions exist:

 - The last character of the pasted text is a space.

 - The space is immediately to the left of the right margin in Microsoft Word.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Make sure the last character of the selected text is not a space.

Method 2
--------

Adjust the right margin in Word so that the space is not the last character on
the line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

design.
