TITLE   :PRB: Sybase Formula One OCX Dependency Warning w/Setup Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbAppSetup kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Visual Basic Setup Wizard to create a setup application, you
receive the following warning:

   No dependency information could be found for: COMCTL32.DLL

which may be followed by:

   No dependency information could be found for: COMDLG32.DLL

CAUSE
=====

When using the Setup Wizard on a project that includes references to the Sybase
Visual Components Formula One 5.0 control, VCF15.OCX, the Setup Wizard requires
additional information to be added to the control's dependency file, VCF15.DEP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, the following information should be added to the
dependency file for the VCF15.OCX control, entitled VCF15.DEP. This file should
be located in the System or System32 directory, depending on the version of
Windows installed.

The dependency file is a text file that can be opened in any typical word
processing application, such as Notepad. The contents of the VCF15.DEP file
include:

[VCF15.OCX]
Register=$(DLLSelfRegister)
Uses1=OLEAUT32.DLL
Uses2=OLEPRO32.DLL
Uses3=STDOLE2.TLB
Uses4=COMCTL32.DLL
Uses5=COMDLG32.DLL

Once the file has been opened, the following information needs to be added to the
end of the file:

[COMCTL32.DLL]
Dest=$(WinSysPathSysFile)
Uses1=

[COMDLG32.DLL]
Dest=$(WinSysPathSysFile)
Uses1=

After the information has been added, save the dependency file and run the Setup
Wizard again. This allows the Setup Wizard to finish the creation of the setup
application, and allows the application to install correctly.
