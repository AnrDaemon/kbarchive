the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

NWLNKIPX sends the broadcast Routing Information Protocol over IPX (RIPX) packet
over the network, even if a frame type and network number is selected manually.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

After applying this fix, use the steps below to create a new registry value.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \NwlnkIpx\Parameters

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

   Value Name: NoBcastRipRequest
   Data Type:  REG_Dword
   Value:      0 or 1
   Default:    0

   Description: This parameter determines if NWLNKIPX sends the Broadcast RIPX
   packet during initialization. Set this value to 1, if you do not want to send
   a Broadcast RIPX packet during initialization.

4. Close Registry Editor.

5. Restart the computer for the registry change to take effect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When NWLNKIPX starts, Routing Information Protocol over IPX (RIPX) broadcasts
are sent to determine the frame type and network number. This RIPX packet is
needed only if the auto-detect feature of NWLNKIPX is selected.
