SUMMARY
=======

When you install Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 on a computer running Microsoft
Windows NT Workstation 4.0, the Flight Simulator Setup program creates shortcuts
in the Microsoft Games common folder. (This Microsoft Games menu is located
below the separator line at the bottom of the Programs menu.)

If you install the Flight Shop Converter for Flight Simulator, (also called the
Aircraft/Adventure Converter), the Converter Setup program creates shortcuts in
a Microsoft Games folder that is accessible only to the current user. (This
Microsoft Games menu is located above the separator line at the bottom of the
Programs menu.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your computer is running Microsoft Windows 95, both Flight Simulator and the
Flight Shop Converter Setup programs create shortcuts in the same Microsoft
Games menu, regardless of whether user profiles are in use.
