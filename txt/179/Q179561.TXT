TITLE   :SMS: Invproc Stops Responding on Long Raw File Records
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a RAW file with a record length greater than 8 KB is processed, Invproc
will stop responding. This forces processor utilization to hang at 100 percent
and Systems Management Server is unable to process RAW files and MIFs.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the buffer length in Invproc is hard-coded to 8 KB.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Stop the SMS_Executive service.

2. Find the RAW file whose record length is greater than 8 KB, and remove it
   from the proper directory paths (\Sms\Site.srv\Inventory.box).

3. Start the SMS_Executive service.
