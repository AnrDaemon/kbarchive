TITLE   :XCLN: Macintosh Client Flashes Splash Screen Without Starting
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:8.0; WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Exchange Macintosh client, the Exchange splash screen appears
then disappears. The client never loads, and no error message is generated.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Microsoft OLE Extension is not loaded before you
try to start the Microsoft Exchange client. With System 7.x or higher, the
Extensions Manager ships with the operating system. This Control Panel allows
the user to activate or deactivate any extensions that are found in the System
folder, Extensions subfolder.

WORKAROUND
==========

Check to see whether the Microsoft OLE Extension has been deactivated via the
Extensions Manager. If so, reactivate it. If the Microsoft OLE Extension is
missing completely, then the Exchange client should be removed and reinstalled.
Refer to the following Knowledge Base articles for more information and for
removal and reinstallation of the Macintosh client:
