TITLE   :SMSINST: Repackage Of Netscape Communicator 4.03 Pro Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to repackage Netscape Communicator 4.03 may fail on systems running
Windows NT, because the icons created by Systems Management Server Installer do
not correspond to those created by the actual Netscape installation. The follow
table lists the icon numbers:

   Icon                  Installer   Netscape
   Name                  Icon No.    Icon No.
   ------------------    ---------   --------
   IBM Host On-Demand         4          5
   Collabra                  31          4
   Composer                 155          3
   Messenger                187         11
   Navigator                254          1
   Netcaster                 28          6
   User Profile Manager      27          7

In the Installation Expert, when you open shortcuts that have icon numbers
greater than 127 and click OK, you are prompted to enter a number between 0 and
127, even though Installation Expert put the higher number in the icon number
field. This may occur with every icon that has a value greater than 127.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem you can manually modify the Systems Management Server
Installer-generated script so that the icon numbers match those created by the
Netscape installation. The icon numbers are listed in the SUMMARY section of
this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
