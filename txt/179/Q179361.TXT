PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, if you open a Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
document or template containing a toolbar with the sad face assigned to a
toolbar button, the original color of the sad face button is lost.

CAUSE
=====

There are certain reserved colors in both Word 95 and Word 97 for Windows. In
Word 95, bright purple is reserved, while in Word 97, bright green and bright
purple are reserved. When you open a toolbar button containing a reserved color
in Word 97, Word makes those colors transparent.

The original color of the sad face button in Word 95 is bright green. Because
bright green is a Word 97 reserved color, it becomes transparent when converted
to Word 97.

WORKAROUND
==========

In Word 97, the sad face button image is the same color as the toolbar. If you
want to use a button image with color, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the mouse on the converted toolbar button and then click
   Customize.

2. Click once to select the sad face button (it should place a black border
   around the sad face) and then right-mouse click the button to show its
   shortcut menu.

3. Use either of the following methods:
    - Point to Change Button Image and select a button face with color on it.

      NOTE: The sad face icon is the color of the background.

   -or-

    - Click Edit Button Image, make the appropriate color changes, and then
      click OK.

4. Click Close.
