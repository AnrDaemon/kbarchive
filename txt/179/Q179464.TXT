SYMPTOMS
========

You attempt to run CedarBank sample from a Web page. After you type a name into
the edit box and click the "Checking Acct. Balance" button, you receive the
following error message:

   Error:
   Session object error 'ASP 0168 : 80004005'
   Disallowed object use
   /cedarbank/selectpage.asp, line 4
   An intrinsic object cannot be stored within the Session object.

CAUSE
=====

Two statements in ~\sna\comti\tutorials\cedarbank\website\Selectpage.asp

      Set Session("CustName") = Request("CustName")

-and-

      Set Session("CustPIN")  = Request("CustPIN"),

are incorrect.

WORKAROUND
==========

Delete the word "Set" from the two problematic statements, or replace the two
lines with these two statements

        Session("CustName") = Request("CustName")

-and-

        Session("CustPIN")  = Request("CustPIN"),

respectively.
