KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a new Exchange Server or Remove All from Exchange
Server, the Exchange Setup Add/Remove dialog box appears.

The Exchange Setup and/or Maintenance Mode Setup Remove All option fails with the
following error message:

   Error 'File=common\list1.c, Line=1018'

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server was not fully removed from a prior installation.
There are orphaned files or registry keys or both that are preventing the
installation or removal of Exchange Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Remove all \exchsrvr directories and subdirectories from each hard disk
   drive.

2. Remove all registry entries keys made by Exchange Server. For information
   about how to do this, please see Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q147374,
   "XADM: Registry Key Modifications Made During Setup."

3. Run Setup from the Exchange Server CD-ROM.
