TITLE   :SMS: Admin Lose Mouse/Keyboard Functionality of WinNT Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When performing Remote Control of a Windows NT-based client and IP as the
protocol, you may lose keyboard and/or mouse functionality on the client from
the Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

If FindAvailableSendSlot (FASS) is lost, Systems Management Server Administrator
program loses the ability to use the mouse and keyboard on the client.

The client can move the mouse cursor and use the keyboard, and the changes are
reflected on the Systems Management Server Administrator viewer screen. This
means that the session is still active. This behavior occurs after a period of
time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
