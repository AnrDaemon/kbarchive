SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Word 97 in a Document Management System (DMS) that uses the
ODMA API, you may receive the following error message after copying a large
amount of text and closing the document:

 - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
   process.

   -or-

 - <document name> is in use by another application.

These error messages will occur when the DMS attempts to move or catalog the
original Word document.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because when you use the Cut or Copy commands to copy
information, Word makes a copy of the information, saves it in memory, and makes
a note of where the copied data is stored (Word caches the data). Word
incorrectly keeps the pointer to this cached information after allowing the file
to be closed. The error message is displayed when DMS attempts to move or
catalog the original Word document.



RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2).
