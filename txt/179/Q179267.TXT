TITLE   :FP97: 32-bit TCP/IP Missing Error After Installing Winsock 2.0
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194347.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start FrontPage, you may see the following error message:

   FrontPage requires 32-bit TCP/IP networking. You do not have 32-bit
   TCP/IP networking installed. Would you like to see help on how to
   install it?

CAUSE
=====

This message appears after you install Windows Sockets (Winsock) 2.0 because
FrontPage may not detect that you have TCP/IP installed if a dynamic host
configuration protocol (DHCP) server is not available. If you are connected to
the network, and a DHCP server is available, FrontPage will operate normally.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, restore Windows Sockets 1.1 and then install the
Windows Sockets 2.0 update. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Restore Windows Sockets 1.1. a. On the Windows Start menu, click Run. b. In
   the Open box, type the following command
   C:\<windir>\ws2bakup\ws2bakup.bat where <windir> is the folder in
   which you installed Windows. NOTE: If you receive a message indicating a
   sharing violation has occurred, press the A key to stop running this command.
   Repeat this step until the batch file has finished running and then follow
   these steps: 1) On the Windows Start menu, click Shutdown. 2) Click "Restart
   the Computer in MS-DOS Mode" and then click OK. 3) At the command prompt,
   type "c:\<windir>\ws2bakup\ws2bakup.bat" (without the quotation marks)
   and press ENTER. NOTE: If you receive an error message while updating the
   registry, ignore the error. 4) Type "exit" (without the quotation marks).
   Windows will restart.

2. Download the Ws2setup.exe file from the following Microsoft World Wide Web
   site:
   http://www.microsoft.com/Windows95/downloads/contents/WUAdminTools/S_WUNetworkingTools/W95Sockets2/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes.asp
   Note in which folder you saved the Ws2setup.exe file.

3. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

4. In the Open box, type the following command <path>\ws2setup.exe where
   <path> is the folder in which you saved the Ws2setup.exe file when you
   downloaded it. Click OK.

5. When the Windows Sockets 2 Setup program has finished running, restart the
   computer. To do this, follow these steps: a. On the Windows Start menu, click
   Shutdown. b. In the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click Restart and then
   click OK. After the computer restarts, the Windows Sockets 2 installation
   will be finished and you will be able to run FrontPage.

NOTE: This error may also occur on a Windows NT system. If you still have a
problem after following the procedure in the "Resolution" section of this
article, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
