to the clients.

MORE INFORMATION

To determine if users are connected to network shares before shutting down a
Windows NT-based computer, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Server.

To warn all connected users that the network shares will no longer be available,
type the following line at a command prompt

" net send /users <message> " (without the quotation marks)

where <message> is the message you want to send.
