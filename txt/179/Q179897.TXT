======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run multiple programs (especially MS-DOS-based programs) on a
Windows-based computer that has insufficient system memory (RAM) and contains an
Intel Pentium Pro or Pentium II processor, information in memory may become
unavailable or damaged, leading to unpredictable results. For example, copy and
compare operations may not work consistently.


CAUSE
=====

This behavior is an indirect result of certain performance optimizations in the
Intel Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors. These optimizations affect how the
Windows 95 Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) performs certain memory operations,
such as determining which sections of memory are not in use and can be safely
freed. As a result, the Virtual Machine Manager may free the wrong pages in
memory, leading to the symptoms described earlier.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
