======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MS-DOS 3.0 network client may stop responding (hang) during the boot
sequence in Tcptsr.exe when using a third-party Dynamic Host Control Protocol
(DHCP) server that does not send the DHCP options RENEWAL TIME and REBIND TIME
for infinite leases. The problem does not occur with the Microsoft DHCP server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, configure the DHCP server to send both fields even
for infinite leases.
