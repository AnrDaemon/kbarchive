======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Network tool in Control Panel to install Microsoft Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), you may be able to select Microsoft
TCP/IP from the list of available protocols, but it may not appear in the list
of installed components.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Mstcp.dll file located in the Windows\System
folder is missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Rename the Mstcp.dll file (if it exists). To do so, follow these steps:

   a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

   b. In the Named box, type "mstcp.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then
      click Find Now.

   c. If the Mstcp.dll file is found, right-click it, and then click Rename. If
      the Mstcp.dll file is not found, skip to step E.

   d. Type a new name for the Mstcp.dll file (such as Mstcp.xxx), and then press
      ENTER.

   e. Close the Find window.

2. Extract a new copy of the Mstcp.dll file from your original Windows 95 disks
   or CD-ROM to the Windows\System folder. The Mstcp.dll file is located in the
   following locations:

    - The Precopy1.cab cabinet file on the Windows 95 and Windows 95 OEM Service
      Release 2 (OSR2) CD-ROM.

    - The Precopy1.cab cabinet file on disk 1 of the original Windows 95 DMF
      floppy disks.

    - The Precopy2.cab cabinet file on disk 2 of the original Windows 95 non-DMF
      floppy disks.

   For information about using the Extract tool, please see the following article
