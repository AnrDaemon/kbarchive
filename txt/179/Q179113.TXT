SUMMARY
=======

This article provides instructions about how to download and install the most
recent version of Microsoft DirectX. DirectX includes updated drivers for the
most popular sound and video adapters.

NOTE: DirectX is a system component. After installation, the DirectX 8.1 run time
cannot be uninstalled without reinstalling your operating system.

Only the most recent version of DirectX is available for download from the
Microsoft Web site. You can download and install this free version for the
Microsoft Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition (Me), and Windows 2000
operating systems.

NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend that you attempt to install earlier versions
of DirectX.

To download and install the latest version of DirectX:

1. Click the link to the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp

2. On the "Home User Downloads Web" page, click the appropriate Web link to
   download the run-time version of DirectX for your operating system.

3. In the File Download dialog box, click "Save this program to disk", click OK,
   and then click Save.

4. When the download process is finished, click Open, and then click Yes.

5. Click Yes again to accept the license agreement.

6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DirectX 8.1 is already included in Microsoft Windows XP. Attempting to install
the DirectX 8.1 run times on Windows XP will have no effect.

DirectX 8.1 will not install on Microsoft Windows 95. With only rare exceptions,
there are no computers running Windows 95 that would be capable of running a
title designed for use with DirectX 8.1. This is because modern games require
processor speeds in excess of the fastest processors used by Windows 95. Current
and future games that will run under Windows 95 should always work with DirectX
8.0a or earlier.

DirectX Setup does not work with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. To use DirectX with
Windows NT 4.0, you need to install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6), which
includes most of the functionality of DirectX 3.0a.
