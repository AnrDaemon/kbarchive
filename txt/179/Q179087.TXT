KEYWORDS:kbproof

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a word to check its spelling and you run the spelling checker,
Word selects and checks the spelling of a different word.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

 - The Check grammar with spelling setting is selected on the Spelling and
   Grammar tab of the Options dialog box (click Options on the Tools menu).

   -and-

 - The sentence in which the selected word occurs contains more than one
   misspelled word.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, turn off the Check grammar with spelling
setting. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Spelling and Grammar
   tab.

2. Under Grammar, clear the Check grammar with spelling check box.

3. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there is a single misspelled word in the sentence, the spelling check is
performed correctly. However, if there is another misspelled word in the same
sentence prior to the word that you selected to be checked, Word selects the
first misspelled word in the sentence. Word then checks any other misspelled
words in the same sentence. After Word completes the spelling check of the
sentence, a dialog box with the following message appears:

   Word finished checking the selection. Do you want to continue checking the
   remainder of the document?

Click Yes if you want to check the rest of the document; click No if you do not
want to continue checking the document.
