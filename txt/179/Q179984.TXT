SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Bookshelf 98, you may receive the following error
message:

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the path specified for the TEMP environment variable

To resolve this issue, disable the Set Temp statement in the Autoexec.bat file.
To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "notepad c:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation
   marks), and then click OK.

3. In the Autoexec.bat window, type "rem" (without the quotation marks) followed
   by a blank space at the beginning of any line that begins with "set temp="
   (without quotation marks).

4. On the File menu, click Save.

5. On the File menu, click Exit.

6. Restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have a TEMP environment variable set in your Autoexec.bat file, Windows
95 preserves the setting for MS-DOS-based programs to use. If the TEMP
environment variable is not set in the Autoexec.bat file, Windows 95 creates and
maintains the following folder for its own use and the use of Windows-based
programs

   <drive>:\<windows>\Temp

where <drive> is the drive on which Windows 95 is installed and
<windows> is the folder in which Windows 95 is installed.

If you delete this folder, Windows 95 re-creates the folder the next time you
start Windows 95.
