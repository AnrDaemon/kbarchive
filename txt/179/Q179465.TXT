======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some of the graphics or links in the "Microsoft Windows 98 Official Preview Kit"
HTML files may not appear or function correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The "Microsoft Windows 98 Official Preview Kit" CD-ROM was duplicated using long
filenames and filenames containing spaces and lowercase letters. CD- ROM drives
that use older MS-DOS drivers will not see these filenames correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact your CD-ROM drive manufacturer to obtain an updated driver for your
CD-ROM drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS cannot read CD-ROM filenames that contain
spaces or lowercase letters. However, later versions of Microsoft Windows,
including Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, use updated CD-ROM drivers to
allow spaces, lowercase letters, and long filenames.

Because Windows 95 permits extended CD-ROM filenames, it does not have problems
reading the CD-ROM for this book. However, Windows 95 configurations that use
MS-DOS CD-ROM drivers will not be able to access the extended CD-ROM filenames
on this CD-ROM.
