SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange client, starting Help starts the Microsoft
Outlook Help file rather than the Exchange Help file. This occurs on a system
that has the Exchange client installed and then is upgraded to Outlook.

CAUSE
=====

During the installation of the Outlook client, the Exchng.cnt file is
overwritten with the information contained that specifies the Outlook Help file
(Outlhlp.hlp) as the default. The Exchng.hlp file is not deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, before you install the Outlook client, back up the
Exchng.cnt file and then restore it to its original location if you want to use
Exchange Help rather than Outlook Help.

-or-

Copy the Exchng.cnt file from a workstation that has not been upgraded. Copy the
Exchng.cnt file back to the \exchange directory.
