TITLE   :XFOR: DBCS Messages Not Migrated Correctly from GroupWise
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate messages that were created using a double-byte character set
(DBCS) from Novell GroupWise, the messages may not be displayed properly when
you open them in an e-mail client after the migration.

CAUSE
=====

When you migrate messages from GroupWise, the messages are converted to Rich
Text Format (RTF) before they are migrated to the Microsoft Exchange Server
computer. Messages that contain DBCS characters may not be converted correctly.
Therefore, they may not be displayed properly when you open them in an e-mail
client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
