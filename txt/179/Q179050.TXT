TITLE   :XADM: WinNT Account Becomes Domain\\User When Output by Export
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you export a directory to a comma-separated values (CSV) file that contains a
Mode column, some information may not be imported when you perform a directory
import from that file. For example, if you add one or more Windows NT user
accounts on a mailbox's Permissions tab, the accounts are not imported when you
perform a directory import.

CAUSE
=====

When you perform a directory export, mailbox information is not exported
properly if the export file contains a Mode column. This prevents the
information from being imported when you perform a directory import from that
file.

======
