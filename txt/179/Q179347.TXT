   b. In the Named box, type "advapi32.dll" (without the quotation marks), and
      then click Find Now.

   c. If the Advapi32.dll file is found, right-click it, and then click Rename.
      If the Advapi32.dll file is not found, skip to step E.

   d. Type a new name for the Advapi32.dll file (such as Advapi32.xxx), and then
      press ENTER.

   e. Close the Find window.

2. Extract a new copy of the Advapi32.dll file from your original Windows 95
   disks or CD-ROM. The Advapi32.dll file is located in the following
   locations:
