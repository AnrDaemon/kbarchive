TITLE   :Settings May Not Be Applied with URL with Short Filename
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 for NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has been made aware of an issue in Internet Information Server (IIS)
4.0 and Personal Web Server (PWS) 4.0 in which certain configuration settings
may not be applied when a URL with short file name equivalents is requested.
These configuration setting include restricting access by IP address, PICS
ratings, and requiring SSL encryption. Windows NT file permissions (ACLs) are
not affected.

Users are able to access certain directories or files through IIS 4.0 or PWS 4.0
and bypass specific security settings, such as SSL encryption.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT and Windows 95 file systems (FAT, FAT32, and NTFS) support file
names of up to 255 characters. To maintain compatibility with older, non 32-bit
applications, a short file name (called the 8.3 file name) is created for each
file. This short file name equivalent is used by older applications to access
directories and files with long names. IIS 4.0 and PWS 4.0 maintain certain
configuration information about directories and files in a database called the
metabase. The metabase does not contain file permissions, but rather Web
server-specific information such as requiring SSL encryption, proxy cache
setting, and PICS ratings. Actual file and directory permissions are enforced by
NTFS and are not affected by this problem.

In certain cases when a URL is requested using the short file name, it is
possible that configuration properties specified in the metabase may not be
applied as expected. This issue only occurs where long file names are used for
directories or files, and specific metabase configuration properties are set on
those directories or files. File permissions by a user or group using NTFS
access control lists (ACL) are not affected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

NOTE: The supported fix is for IIS and PWS on Windows NT Workstation. A fix for
PWS on Microsoft Windows 95 is still pending.

listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================
