TITLE   :Unable to Modify Logon Hours on a Member Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a stand-alone server or member server in a domain environment, administrators
are unable to modify the logon hours for a user in User Manager. These hours can
be set if a new user account is created by using the Add User Accounts wizard
included in the Administrative Wizards. However, after the user is created,
there is no way to adjust this restriction through User Manager.

CAUSE
=====

In User Manager, the button entitled Hours does not exist and, therefore,
prevents modification of a user's logon hours on the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

The user's logon hours can be modified by using the NET USERS command. For
example, to set the user's logon hours to Mondays and Tuesdays from 2:00 A.M. to
3:00 A.M., enter the following command:

C:\>NET USER USER_NAME /TIMES:MONDAY,TUESDAY,2

Further information on the NET USERS command can be obtained by typing:

C:\>NET HELP USERS

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
