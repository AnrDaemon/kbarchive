PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the UserConnection Designer, you receive the following message when
attempting to build a query:

   There was a problem attempting to communicate with MS Query.

CAUSE
=====

The UserConnection Designer cannot find where MS Query is located on the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure the proper registry key is pointing to where MS Query is located on
the system. To do so, you must use RegEdit.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

The correct registry key is found at the following location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\VBQuery

The Path value should be set correctly to where MS Query is located. The MS Query
executable is named Msqry32.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Launch Regedit.exe (click Run on the Start menu, choose REGEDIT, and click
   OK).

2. Go to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\VBQuery key.

3. This key has two data values. Edit the "Path" value to make it invalid (for
   example, change the name of Msqry32.exe to Msqry3.exe).

4. Start Visual Basic and select a standard EXE.

5. Click Add ActiveX Designer on the Project menu, and select "Microsoft
   UserConnection."

6. When the UserConnection property page appears, select "User DNS-Less
   Connection String."

7. Under "ODBC Driver," select "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)" and click OK.

8. Under the UserConnections form, right-click UserConnection1 and select
   "Insert Query."

9. When the ODBC Microsoft Access 97 Setup dialog box appears, click OK.

10. When the Select Database dialog box appears, choose the "NWIND.MDB"
   database, and click OK.

11. When the Query1 dialog box appears, click the "Based On User-Defined SQL"
   option.

12. Type in the SQL statement "Select * from customers" (without the quotation
   marks) in the text box, then click the "Build" button.

   Visual Basic will hang for a few seconds, one of the following will happen:

    - You will receive the following message:

   There was a problem attempting to communicate with MS Query.

    - Your SQL statement will be erased.

13. Edit the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\VBQuery key back
   to its original value.

14. Repeat steps 4-12, and MS Query will launch properly.

Additional query words: user connection msquery
