TITLE   :XADM: Removed AB View Containers Are Re-created Automatically
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange version 5.0, after you remove empty containers from
Address Book (AB) views, the containers may be automatically regenerated.

CAUSE
=====

If an Address Book View container stores only hidden recipients, the container
will appear to be empty, and Microsoft Exchange version 5.0 will allow you to
remove this container. This can be done either by using the Remove Empty
Containers button on the Advanced tab of the view's properties dialog box, or by
highlighting the container and using the Delete command from the Edit menu. In
either case, the view's container will be removed but will be regenerated in the
background as the Address Book views are updated.

WORKAROUND
==========

To remove an Address Book View container that appears to be empty, do the
following:

1. Verify that there are no hidden recipients within the container. This can be
   done with the Hidden Recipients command on the View menu.

2. To remove the recipients, either delete them or modify their properties so
   they are no longer associated with that Address Book view's container.

3. Remove the empty container by clicking Remove Empty Containers on the
   Advanced tab of the view's Properties dialog box.
