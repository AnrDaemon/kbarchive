   that terminal emulator.

5. In the Connect Using box, click the COM port your adapter is configured to
   use, and then click OK.

   If your adapter connects, quit HyperTerminal, and then continue to the next
   step. If you cannot connect, repeat steps 1-8.

   NOTE: The Ascend Pipeline 25-Px ISDN adapter uses a technology called MP+.
   Adapters that use this technology do not use the second channel until the
   bandwidth is high enough to require it. When the second channel is required
   it connects automatically.

10. Right-click the MSN or The Microsoft Network icon on your desktop, and then
   click Properties.

11. On the Connection tab, click "Connect to the Internet using a local area
   network."

12. Click the "Access the Internet using a proxy server" check box to clear it,
   and then click OK.
