   Change.

5. Click Show All Devices. Note the current manufacturer and model.

6. In the Manufacturers box, click (Standard Display Types).

7. In the Models box, click Standard Display Adapter(VGA), and then click OK.

8. Click Close until you return to Control Panel.

9. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

10. Follow the instructions that came with your display adapter to reinstall the
   original video driver from the manufacturer's CD-ROM or floppy disk(s).

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may also be able to resolve this issue by reducing the graphics hardware
acceleration to the Basic setting. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
