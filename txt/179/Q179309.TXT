TITLE   :XADM: LDAP Port for SSL Is Not Configurable In Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5, the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) port for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) can not be changed;
it is fixed on port 636.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, all clients are configured to connect to port 636 for SSL LDAP
directory queries. This port is not configurable from the client, so there is no
reason to change it on the server. Doing so would make clients unable to connect
for these queries. Normal LDAP queries are configured for Port 389. For more
information on configuring this port, please see the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:
