Page 290: Code Sample: Quote Marks Outside Parenthesis
------------------------------------------------------

In the code sample on page 290, the quote marks included in the MsgBox statements
are in the wrong place in the SpinButton_Spinup() and SpinButton_SpinDown()
subroutines. Change the routines to read as follows:

      Sub SpinButton_SpinUp()
         MsgBox ("Up arrow clicked")
      End Sub
      Sub Spinbutton_SpinDown()
         MsgBox ("Down arrow clicked")
      End Sub
