-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 5.0sp1, 5.0sp2, 5.0sp3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation included with Visual C++ 5.0 incorrectly states that SQL
Server does not need to be configured to log on under a user account for SQL
Debugging to work in all cases.

If you are using SQL Debugging with one or two machines when you are using SQL
Server as a Service, you need to configure SQL Server to log on under a user
account, not under the local system account.

If you use SQL Debugging with SQL Server logged on as the local system account,
the following error message will appear in the application event log from the
source MSDEVSDI:

   SQL Server when started as service must not log on as System Account. Reset
   to logon as user account using Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The documentation in question can be found at mk:@ivt:vccore/F2D/D32/S4D107.HTM
in the Visual C++ documentation.

NOTE: The documentation has been fixed for Visual C++ 6.0.
