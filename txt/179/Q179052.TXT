TITLE   :BUG: Transparent Label on Transparent Control Does Not Display
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Label text on a UserControl does not appear or appears "jagged" when the
UserControl is placed in a container.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the BackStyle property of both the Label control and
the UserControl are set to Transparent. If the Font property of the Label
control is set to a TrueType font, the Label text appears "jagged." If the Font
property of the Label control is set to a non-TrueType font, the Label text does
not appear at all.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new ActiveX control project in Visual Basic. UserControl1 is created
   by default.

2. Set the BackStyle property of UserControl1 to 0-Transparent.

3. Add a Label control to UserControl1. Set the BackStyle property of the Label
   control to 0-Transparent. Enter some text in the Caption property, such as
   "Hello World." Close the UserControl1 control.

    - From the File menu, click Add Project. The Add Project dialog box appears.

    - From the New Tab, click Standard EXE.

    - Click Open to close the dialog box. Form1 is created by default.

5. Add the UserControl you created in the previous steps to Form1. Note that the
   caption in the Label control does not appear.
