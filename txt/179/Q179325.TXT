KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbimu

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Flight Simulator 98 and you click Time & Season on the
World menu, your computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Adobe Type Manager is installed. Adobe Type Manager
makes the following modifications to the System.ini file:

   [Boot]
   SYSTEM.DRV=ATMSYS.DRV
   ATMSYS.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, disable Adobe Type Manager. To do so, use the
following steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "system.ini" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

3. In the [Boot] section of the System.ini file, locate the following lines:

   SYSTEM.DRV=ATMSYS.DRV
   ATM.SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV

4. Type a semicolon (;) at the beginning of both lines, for example:

   ;SYSTEM.DRV=ATMSYS.DRV
   ;ATM.SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV

5. Type the following line in the [Boot] section of the System.ini file:

   System.drv=System.drv

6. On the File menu, click Save.

7. On the File menu, click Exit.

8. Restart the computer.
