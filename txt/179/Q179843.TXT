TITLE   :OFF97: Compile Error Using the Visible Property of UserForms
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming kbwordvba word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to set or change the Visible property of a UserForm, you
receive the following error message:

   Compile error:
   Wrong number of arguments or invalid property assignment.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you attempt to modify a read-only property. For example,
the following sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications code generates the
error:

      Sub HideForm()
         UserForm1.Visible = False ' Generates a Compile error.
      End Sub
    
      Sub ShowForm()
         UserForm1.Visible = True  ' Generates a Compile error.
      End Sub

The Visible property is designed to let you check the Visible state of a specific
form, but not modify it. To modify the Visible state of a form, use the Hide and
Show methods to change the form's Visible property.

NOTE: The following code samples assume your form is named UserForm1. Replace
UserForm1 with the name of your form or a reference to your form.

How to Use the Show and Hide Methods
------------------------------------

The following sample Visual Basic code hides a UserForm:

      Sub HideForm()
         UserForm1.Hide
      End Sub

The following sample Visual Basic code shows a UserForm:

      Sub ShowForm()
         UserForm1.Show
      End Sub

How to Use the Visible Property
-------------------------------

The following sample Visual Basic code checks the Visible property of a form:

      Sub CheckFormState()

         ' Determine whether the form is visible.
         If UserForm1.Visible = True Then
            ' Do something when the form is visible.
         End If

         ' Determine whether the form is hidden.
         If UserForm1.Visible = False Then
             ' Do something when the form is hidden.
         End If

      End Sub
