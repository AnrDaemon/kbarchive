PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send mail to a cc:Mail user by means of the Microsoft Exchange Server
Internet Mail Service, the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail adds a
preceding comma to the sender's SMTP address. In the cc:Mail client, the
sender's address is displayed as follows:

   ,User [SMTP:User@Domain.com] at <Exchange Server site>

STATUS
======


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================


This problem does not interfere with mail flow between the systems. All replies
are processed normally. Also, this problem only manifests itself if the
Connector for cc:Mail is configured to point to a cc:Mail DB8 post office. The
Connector for cc:Mail was updated to convert the addresses in the following
manner:

+----------------------------------------------------------+
| SMTP Senders Display Name | How It Appears in ccMail Now | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Test User                 | "Test User"                  | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| User, Test                | "User; Test"                 | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Test                      | "Test"                       | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| "Test"                    | "Test"                       | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
