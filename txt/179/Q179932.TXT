SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Compound Interest InterActivity in Microsoft Encarta
Encyclopedia to determine the amount of time you need to save $1 million, the
dollar amount you type in the Monthly Contribution box multiplied by the number
of years the InterActivity calculates you need to save may not match the Amount
From Contribution calculated by the InterActivity.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the InterActivity rounds up the number of years
you need to save to the nearest whole year. For example, if you need to save for
44 years and 2 months, the InterActivity calculates you need to save for 45
years to save $1 million.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Amount From Contribution calculated by the InterActivity is equal to the
dollar amount you type in the Monthly Contribution box multiplied by the actual
number of months you need to save $1 million. If the number of months is equal
to a whole number of years, the discrepancy described in the Symptoms section
does not occur.

NOTE: Encarta Encyclopedia calculates the amount of time in full years. No months
are displayed in the results.
