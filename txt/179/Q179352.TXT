SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply or remove the bullet formatting of text that has custom tab stops
and tab characters, the tab characters will be removed; however, the tab stops
will be retained.

CAUSE
=====

When you apply bullet formatting, the paragraph acquires a hanging indent format
and sometimes a left indentation, depending on the original location of text.
This action also removes the tab characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, click in the line of text where you want the tab
character to appear and press TAB to reinsert the tab character.

   -or-

Do not apply or remove bullet formatting from lines of text to which you have
applied custom tab stops and tab characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using custom tabs in Word is a two-step process: You need to set tab stops and
press TAB to insert tab characters in your document.

For more information about setting tabs, click the Office Assistant, type "tab,"
click Search, and then click the topic you want to review.
