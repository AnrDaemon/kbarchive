SUMMARY
=======

You cannot route multicast Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) packets with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows NT does not support the ability to route multicast packets, or
to act as a multicast TCP/IP server.

Windows NT can receive multicast packets as a client for use with a program such
as Microsoft NetShow, but it cannot act as a server or router of multicast
packets.
