SUMMARY
=======

Periodically, asynchronous mail flow problems can arise during connection. The
procedures in this article can be helpful in troubleshooting the problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot asynchronous mail flow problems:

1. Ensure Mail Agents on both sides of the connection can access the modem. At
   an MS-DOS prompt, type

   " ECHO ATDT > COM# " (without the quotation marks)

   where # is the com port that the mail agent is configured to use.

   If another MS-DOS prompt is returned, the modem is accessible to the Mail
   Agent. If the error message, "Write fault error writing device COM#," is
   returned, the modem is not accessible to any Mail Agent. This must be
   resolved before the Mail Agents can use the modem. Often another application
   will be using the modem. Look for RAS, Fax applications, or any application
   that uses a modem.

2. Enable logging on both sides of the connection.

   a. For Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, ensure that the System Selector is
      set to Mail Remote for Windows.

   b. Edit Msmail.ini in the Windows directory. Under the [SFS Remote] section,
      add the following entries and save the file.

            DebugLog=1
            VerboseLog=1

   c. Restart the client. This detailed logging information can be viewed after
      the connection attempt by choosing <VIEW><SESSION LOG> in the
      client. Information in this log is replaced by information from subsequent
      connection attempts. To save the information, it must be copied and pasted
      to another file to be saved.

   d. For External.exe, add the following options to the command line:

         -Q123Z -V -Lc:\logfile.txt

   e. Restart External. This detailed logging information can be viewed after
      the connection attempt by opening Logfile.txt. Information in this log is
      appended, so all subsequent connection attempts are written to this file.
      If you are using the Windows NT message transfer agent (MTA), you can add
      these options to the Command-Line Options box in the Edit Service dialog.
      The MTA service must be restarted for the change to take effect.

Additional information concerning the INI equivalents for the -Qx options can be
found in Q116434 (see below).

1. Determine whether there are any errors. Some typical errors are:

 - Time out occurred while reading data at the serial layer.

 - Time out occurred while writing data at the serial layer.

   These errors typically point to a problem with the modem script. Verify with
   the modem manufacturer that the appropriate script is being used for the
   modem.

 - Sign-on ID or password incorrect.

 - Postoffice has not accepted mail item.

   These errors can indicate a postoffice serial number problem. Ensure that the
   <EXTERNAL ADMIN><SETUP> information in Admin.exe is correct for
   the postoffice being called. Also, create a new data disk for remote users
   having these problems.

1. Determine line diagnostics. These appear in the log after each connection
   attempt when -Q2Z is enabled. A sample listing:

      TEST      1-1-98 12:00 Diagnostics for connection:
      TEST      1-1-98 12:00 Bad STX     0
      TEST      1-1-98 12:00 Bad TYPE    0
      TEST      1-1-98 12:00 Bad SEQ     0
      TEST      1-1-98 12:00 Bad CRC1    0
      TEST      1-1-98 12:00 Bad CRC2    0
      TEST      1-1-98 12:00 Time-outs   0
      TEST      1-1-98 12:00 Rejects     0

If any of the above diagnostic results are other than zero, this may indicate
"dirty" phone lines. Microsoft cannot guarantee asynchronous mail flow over a
connection indicating anything greater than 0 for these diagnostics. This can
also be an indication of incompatible modem and script combination. More
detailed information regarding these measurements can be found in Microsoft
Knowledge Base article Q80272 (see below).
