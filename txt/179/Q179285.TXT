TITLE   :PRB: Disabled Developer Studio Add-Ins Not Unloaded From Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC500 kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a DLL add-in is disabled in Developer Studio through the Tools/Customize
dialog box (click Customize on the Tools menu), the DLL is not unloaded from
memory. As a result, if the add-in is being built in Developer Studio, the
linker cannot overwrite the still-loaded DLL and will give the following error
message:

   LINK : fatal error LNK1168: cannot open Debug/test.dll for writing

NOTE: Test.dll is the name of the add-in DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

After disabling the add-in, close Developer Studio then reopen Developer Studio.
The development environment will not load the add-in, and therefore changes may
be made to the DLL.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

REFERENCES
==========

The online help topic "Disconnecting Add-ins from Developer Studio" describes
part of the process of disabling an add-in:

   If you remove the check mark from an add-in, you will unload it. When you
   unload it, the add-in loses all of its toolbar and keystroke assignments.

This statement is misleading because the add-in is not unloaded from memory, but
rather the functions provided in the add-in are unloaded from Developer Studio.
This is made clearer in the topic "How Add-ins Connect and Disconnect":

   When Developer Studio quits, it unloads each add-in by calling the
   OnDisconnection method exposed by the add-in's DSAddIn object.

Consult your product documentation for more information on creating and using
add-ins in Developer Studio.
