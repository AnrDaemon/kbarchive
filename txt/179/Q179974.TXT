TITLE   :FS98: Reduced Frame Rate When Flying LearJet 45
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you fly the LearJet 45 in Flight Simulator 98, the frame rate (the speed at
which images are drawn on the screen, usually measured in frames per second) may
be reduced. As a result, the motion of the airplane may not appear smooth.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the instrument panel of the LearJet 45 requires
more system resources than the instrument panels of the other airplanes included
with Flight Simulator 98.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, configure Flight Simulator 98 to use less system
resources.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For information about how to configure Flight Simulator 98 to use less system
resources, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
