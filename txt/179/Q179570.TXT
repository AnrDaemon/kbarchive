======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Inside Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 ISBN 1-57231-331-5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run "SQL Server Books Online" from the Start menu, the
Microsoft Info Viewer window appears. However, the window may be blank or may
not include "SQL Server Books Online" as an option.

CAUSE
=====

The shortcut to the SQL Server Books Online file installed to the Start menu
does not give the correct location of the SQL Server Books Online file.
Consequently, the Info Viewer program cannot find the SQL Server Books Online
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the shortcut, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type the following command, including quotation marks:

   " "C:\Inside SQL Server\Sql Server Books Online\infoview.exe" sqlbooks.mvb "
   (without the quotation marks)

   Change the path to match the Inside SQL Server folder if necessary.

The SQL Server Books Online will appear.

NOTE: You need to perform these steps only once. Once you have performed these
steps, the Start menu shortcut will work normally.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in "Inside Microsoft SQL Server
Version 6.5." This problem will be corrected in future reprints and editions.
