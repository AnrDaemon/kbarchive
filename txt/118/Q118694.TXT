TITLE   :Alternating DOS Client RPC Calls Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

A DOS DCE (data communication equipment) RPC (remote procedure calls) client
binds to a DCE RPC server and places a successful RPC call. The client will not
place any additional RPC calls for a period of time. During this window of time,
some RPC servers may close the connection. The next RPC call from the client to
the server will fail. If the exact same call is placed again, after the failing
call, it will work. The above pattern repeats indefinitely.

CAUSE
=====

The RPC runtime is not being notified of the closed connection. Once the RPC
runtime discovers the connection is closed by a failing call, it will establish
a new session on the next RPC call to the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

RPC runtime will now retry three times if a call fails. During the retry, the
connection will be reestablished.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in the latest US Service
Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server. For information on obtaining
