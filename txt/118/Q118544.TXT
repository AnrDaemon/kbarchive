The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Dangerous Creatures from Squeegee (instead of from Program Manager or
the Windows 95 desktop) a general protection (GP) fault may occur. Under Windows
95, the initial error dialog reads

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

This happens if you choose Back while in any Dangerous Creatures game. This
problem occurs because Squeegee is not compatible with Dangerous Creatures.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Squeegee is a third-party interface for Windows, which you can use instead of
Program Manager or the Windows 95 desktop. For more information about this
product, contact ICOM Simulations at (708) 520-4440.
