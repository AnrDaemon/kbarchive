TITLE   :PRB: "SQL Column Not Found" with Macro Substitution in SELECT
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c; MS-DOS:2.0,2.5,2.5a,2.5b,2.6; WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,2.5b,2.6,3.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error message below will be generated when you are using macro substitution
for the table name in the <alias>.<select_item> clause in a
SELECT-SQL statement:

      SQL column <macro variable + table field> not found

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally macro substitution will not cause a problem when used in the FROM
<table> clause. Macro substitution is a good way of using replaceable
parameters during program execution, such as when you are specifying that the
same field name from several tables should be used as the <select_item>.
For example, using the FoxPro 2.x CUSTOMER and INVOICES tables:

      table1='customer'
      table2='invoices'
      SELECT customer.cno, invoices.cno FROM &table1, &table2;
         WHERE customer.cno=invoices.cno INTO CURSOR QUERY

However, using all macro substitution in the example below will result in the
error message mentioned above:

      SELECT &table1.cno, &table2.cno FROM &table1, &table2;
         WHERE &table1.cno=&table2.cno INTO CURSOR QUERY

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, insert an extra period (".") between each of the
macro-substituted tables and the table field names. For example:

      SELECT &table1..cno, &table2..cno FROM &table1, &table2;
         WHERE &table1..cno=&table2..cno INTO CURSOR QUERY

The extra period is required as a terminator for the macro substitution.
