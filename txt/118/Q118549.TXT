PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications created using FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS fail to start from
File Manager or Program Manager if Win32s is installed. The hourglass appears
and then goes away, but the application does not start.

CAUSE
=====

The application is identified as having the Parity Enable (PE) format, so it is
loaded by the Win32s loader. However, output to the console is not supported, so
the application does not appear to be running.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a program information file (PIF) to start the application. When the PIF
is run from File Manager or Program Manager, the application is started by
Windows and runs correctly.
