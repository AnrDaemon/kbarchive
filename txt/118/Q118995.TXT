The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1994 edition

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to view information about Paul Sorrento's 1989 statistics, the
following error message displays:

   File "mv.m11" bad or missing. Click OK to continue, or click Cancel to close
   Complete Baseball.

If you click OK, Complete Baseball returns to Paul Sorrento, and shows 1989 as
the year. However the information will be the same as 1990.

CAUSE
=====

Paul Sorrento's rookie year was 1990. There should not be an option to look at
1989.

2. Click the Change Player button.

3. Type "SOR" (without the quotation marks) in the Type Player Name box, and
   choose OK (this brings up Paul Sorrento).

4. Click Change Year and choose 1989. Choose OK.
