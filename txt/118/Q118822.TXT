SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses Novell NetWare utilities that do not run under Windows
95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NWUSER.EXE
----------

Unlike previous versions of NETWARE.DRV, which were provided by Novell, Microsoft
wrote the NETWARE.DRV file provided with Windows 95. This NETWARE.DRV file does
not support NWUSER because the user interface in Windows 95 provides similar
functionality.


PSERVER.EXE
-----------

The Novell PSERVER utility makes connections by logging you off the network and
then logging you back in as a PSERVER object. Because this limits the
workstation to PSERVER functions, Windows 95 does not support this utility.

NDS
---

To use a utility (such as NWADMIN or NETADMIN) that requires you to be logged in
to the NetWare Directory Services (NDS) or that makes NDS API calls, you must
install the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS). For
information about obtaining MSNDS, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
