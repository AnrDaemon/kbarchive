======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you format a floppy disk in File Manager, you receive the following error
message:

   WINFILE caused a General Protection fault in module WINFILE at 0009:028A

NOTE: This error message may occur immediately if the Quick Format option is
chosen.

CAUSE
=====

This general protection (GP) fault is caused by SYMEVNT.386, a device added to
the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file by Norton Utilities version 8.0:

      device=symevnt.386   ;Added By NU8

RESOLUTION
==========

Symantec has confirmed this to be a problem in SYMEVNT.386. To correct this
problem, download file NU8DRV.EXE from the Symantec bulletin board service
(BBS).

Before you obtain the NU8DRV.EXE file, you can work around this problem by
opening the SYSTEM.INI file a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) and adding a
semicolon preceding the device=symevnt.386 line to disable it:

        ;device=symevnt.386   ;Added By NU8

Then restart Windows to make this change take effect.

NOTE: Disabling the above line is a temporary fix only, and it may cause problems
with using Norton Utilities.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information, contact Symantec Technical Support by phone or through the
Symantec forum on CompuServe (GO SYMANTEC).
