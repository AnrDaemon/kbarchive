SUMMARY
=======

This article explains Microsoft Mail File Format API (FFAPI) error message
formatting. Formats indicate the message and line number that caused problems
with a FFAPI operation.

Errors appear in this format:

xxx-yyy-zzz Text describing the error

Where:

xxx = The error number, which is explained in the FFAPI SDK manual.

yyy = The position number of the message in the MMF file that FFAPI was operating
on at the time.

zzz = The message line-number that produced the problem.

For example, here is a common error:

141-1-2 Cannot match token TO (has tail net/po/mailbox)

141 = cannot match token < > (has tail < >)
1 = the first message in the MMF file
2 = the second line of the message

The most common reason for this error is unsuccessful FFAPI parsing due to the
presence of an incorrect "end of line" marker. See -f parameter for more
information on this particular error.
