TITLE   :BUG: GETFILEINFOQQ with UNPACKTIMEQQ Fails in MS-DOS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using GETFILEINFOQQ to get the creation time of a file and UNPACKTIMEQQ to
unpack the data into a usable form results in a time that is off by several
hours. This problem occurs only in MS-DOS or version 3.1 of Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for
MS-DOS, version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To generate the the incorrect file time:

1. Compile the sample code below, and name the code "TEST.FOR".

2. Type "dir test.for" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt in the
   directory containing the sample code. Record the present year, month, day,
   hour, and minute.

3. Run the sample code from MS-DOS or from an MS-DOS command prompt in Windows
   (not Windows NT), and compare the date and time shown with the date and time
   from step 2.

Sample Code
-----------

   c compile options needed: none

         include 'flib.fi'
         include 'flib.fd'
         integer*2 iyr, imon,iday,ihr,imin,isec
         character*1 AMPM /'a'/ 
         record /FILE$INFO/info
         ihandle = FILE$FIRST
         len=getfileinfoqq('TEST.FOR' ,info, ihandle)
         call unpacktimeqq(info.lastwrite, iyr,imon,iday,ihr,imin,isec)
         if (ihr .gt. 11) AMPM = 'p'
         if (ihr .gt. 12) ihr = ihr-12
         write (*,"(1x,2(I2.2,'-'),I2.2,I4,':',I2.2,a)")
        +  imon,iday,iyr-1900,ihr,imin,AMPM
         END
