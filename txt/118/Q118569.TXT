TITLE   :Domain Guests Group Not Created On Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Domain Guests group is not created when you upgrade Windows NT 3.1 to
Windows NT 3.5.

CAUSE
=====

A new security feature of Windows NT 3.5 is that the Guest account is no longer
a member of the Domain Users group by default. Some users objected to having the
Guest account defaulting to the Domain Users group so a new Domain Guests group
was created.

When you install (not upgrade to) Windows NT 3.5, the default is to create the
Domain Guests group that includes the Guest account. When you upgrade to Windows
NT 3.5, the default is to not create the Domain Guests group and to leave the
Guest account in the Domain Users account.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create a Domain Guests group and add the Guest account to that group. Remove the
Guest account from the Domain Users group.
