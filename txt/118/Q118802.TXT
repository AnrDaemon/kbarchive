INTRODUCTION TO FW1022

The FoxPro wizards are specifically designed to guide new users through creating
basic, flat-file (single table) application modules. These modules are tables,
screens, queries, and reports. Flat files are nonrelational databases. The
wizards do not support relational database features by default.

The modules generated by the wizards can be modified with FoxPro's power tools to
support one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Doing so, however, requires
fairly extensive knowledge of Xbase programming, and will not be discussed in
this document. Instead, this document presents a step-by-step process for
creating a complete flat-file application.
