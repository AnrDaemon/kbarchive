MORE INFORMATION

The Bookshelf 1994 Atlas Help topic states:

NOTE: The following information is in the Atlas Help file, under the heading The
Atlas Gallery Tabbed List.

   When you want to browse through all the multimedia items in the atlas, click
   the Gallery Tab. In the Atlas Gallery, click the All Media button to see a
   list of all the maps that contain the different multimedia items. Use the
   scroll bar to browse through the list. Click a list item to open the article.

However, all media gallery categories are unavailable in the Atlas. This is
because the maps and sounds are included in each individual entry, available
under Contents. There is no browse feature for maps or sounds.
