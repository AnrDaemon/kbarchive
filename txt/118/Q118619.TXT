The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) is running, the display window or
SESSION.LOG file may show the following error message:

   Drive in Error: <drive letter>

CAUSE
=====

The External Mail program can determine, for various reasons, that a postoffice
on a particular disk drive has an error. As a result, the External Mail program
no longer checks the queues for mail destined for that postoffice. Although mail
will enter the postoffice's queue, the External Mail program will not send it.


RESOLUTION
==========

If the SESSION.LOG is enabled, determine if a drive error has occurred by
searching for a "drive in Error:" message. Likewise, look for a "Testing
permanent drive:" message, which may occur after a drive failure.

The External Mail program may consider a drive to be in error if there are
network or server problems. Ensure the correct network software (drivers,
redirectors, requestors, and so forth) are being used.

Several errors must occur on a drive before that drive is considered in error.
When the External Mail program experiences a problem with a particular
postoffice on a drive, it will test the drive again when it is finished moving
mail.

One of the most common causes of this problem is a missing or corrupted .MBG
and/or .KEY file for an externally defined postoffice. Ensure that an .MBG and a
.KEY file exist for each externally defined postoffice. To check for corruption,
make sure the .MBG files are evenly divisible by 116 bytes (or 0 bytes). All
.KEY files should be 560 bytes in size (any other size indicates corruption in
the .KEY file).
