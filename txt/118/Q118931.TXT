TITLE   :Writer: Pattern-Filled Word Shapes Don't Print
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a STAR NX 2420 Rainbow printer, solid-color fills in spletters
print correctly. (Spletters are word shapes created using the Word Shape tool.
This is similar to WordArt in other Microsoft applications.) However, if you
apply a pattern to the fill, the letter outlines print, but there is no color or
pattern. Letters appear transparent so that an applied shadow will show through
the letters when printed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs using the STAR driver version 1.2, or an Epson LQ-860
emulation using driver version 2.11. There is no known resolution to this
problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer version 1.0, 1.1
and 1.1a for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Pattern-filled spletters print properly from Microsoft Fine Artist to the STAR NX
2420 Rainbow. Pattern-filled WordArt objects print correctly from other
Microsoft applications to the STAR NX 2420 Rainbow.
