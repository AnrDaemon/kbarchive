The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Ancient Lands for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Ancient Lands index always comes up on the letter A, instead of returning to
the letter you viewed most recently. This behavior is by design. To view a
different index screen, choose the letter you want, or use the right and left
arrow buttons.

Choosing the Back button takes you through the main screens you viewed last. If
you choose the Back button a sufficient number of times, Ancient Lands will
return to the index screen you viewed previously.
