SUMMARY
=======

FORTRAN QuickWin applications can have only 50 user-added menu items.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Attempting to create more than 50 new menu items using AppendMenuQQ or
InsertMenuQQ fails (functions return FALSE). The additional menu items beyond 50
are not created.

To demonstrate the restriction, compile and run the sample code below. When
asked, request 51 menu items. You'll notice a "T" by menu items up to item 50
indicating success, but "F" for item 51, indicating failure. Therefore, only the
items "Menutest1" through "Menutest50" are added to the application menus.

Sample Code
-----------

   C compile options needed: /MW

         include 'flib.fi'
         include 'flib.fd'

         character*11 name
         external menutest

         write(*,"(' How many menus to create?',\)")
         read *,n

         do m = 1,n
           write(name,"('Menutest',i2.2,a)")m,char(0)
           print *,appendmenuqq(m/10+1,$MENUENABLED,name,menutest),m
         end do

         read *
         END

         subroutine menutest(L)
         logical L
         print *, 'Checked=',L
         end
