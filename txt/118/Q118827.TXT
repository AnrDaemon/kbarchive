SUMMARY
=======

After you install Microsoft Client or Gateway Service for NetWare, if you prefer
to disable the NetWare broadcasts, do the following:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and go to the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWCWorkstation
   \Parameters

2. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value.

3. Enter the following values:

   Value Name: DisablePopup
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 1

4. Exit Registry Editor and restart Windows NT.

NOTE: This option is equivalent to the CASTOFF ALL command for NetWare in a
MS-DOS environment.

NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc. a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
