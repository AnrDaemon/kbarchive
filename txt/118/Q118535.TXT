The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Disclose Recipients option (chosen when you send a message) discloses P1
recipients that are not on the P2 list. For instance, if a distribution list in
the P2 lists is expanded, the new members are added to the P1 list and the P2
list does not change. In this case, the Disclose Recipient feature lists all the
P1 recipients with the X.400 Recipients header in the recipient's mail client.

Also, if the intended (original) recipient is invalid, and the Alternate
Recipient field is turned on, the message is redirected to the ADMIN account,
rather than declared undeliverable. In this case, the ADMIN account is the
actual recipient while the invalid address is the intended recipient. You always
see the intended recipient regardless of any switch settings.

For example, if you send a message to a group in the X.400 world, and Disclose
Recipients on Microsoft Mail Gateway is turned OFF, then the recipients see only
the group name, not the names of group members.

Additional query words: 3.00 x400 disclose recipient
