======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you eject the Dangerous Creatures CD while a movie is playing, you may
receive a "Stack Overflow" error message. This usually occurs after you have
received several "Cannot Find Data" error messages and chosen Cancel several
times.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dangerous Creatures version 1.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do not remove the Dangerous Creatures CD while the
program is running. It is never a good idea to remove any disk or CD while your
computer is reading it.

For more information, refer to the Dangerous Creatures readme file.
