SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run an MS-DOS-based application, Windows 95 reports the

above the 1-megabyte (MB) range for executable code. Older MS-DOS- based
applications may load incompatible versions of DOS extenders and cause the above
error.

The following applications are known to exhibit this problem:
