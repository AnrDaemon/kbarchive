TITLE   :UNC-Format Path Affects the DIR Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a program item in Program Manager that points to a batch file on a
remote server using a universal naming convention (UNC)-specified path and the
batch file executes a DIR command followed by any parameter, when you start the
program item, the following error message appears:

   The system cannot find the file specified.

After running the batch file, if you execute a DIR command with any parameter
from the command line, you will receive the same error message.

However, executing a DIR command on a remote directory using a UNC- specified
path as follows does not return an error:

   DIR \\<computer name>\<share name>\<directory>\<batch
   file name>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1 and Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server
version 3.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
