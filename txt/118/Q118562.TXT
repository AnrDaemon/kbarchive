TITLE   :SMTP: Cannot Export Address List Using ODI Drivers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A problem with the SMTPGET function affects both the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
SMTP and the Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&T. When an address list is
exported from one postoffice to another indirectly via the SMTP or AT&T
gateway (backboning), you get the following AT&T gateway error when you try
to process the exported address lists:

   [01-28-94 07:47:55] Sent a Message From User: DEERFIELD/SENSOR3/*SPECIAL
   [01-28-94 07:47:55] A P1 Message Recipient: SENSOREUR/EURGER/*SPECIAL
   [01-28-94 07:47:55] The Message Size That Was Sent: 3644
   [01-28-94 07:47:55] Err=-9702 Function=MMFF_DequeueMsg No KeywordFound:

   [Garbage here]

   [01-28-94 07:48:22] Processing a Message

CAUSE
=====

The SMTPGET function fails to extract the address list contained in an
attachment when you use ODI network drivers on Novell LANs. Here are the
AUTOEXEC.BAT entries for the ODI drivers:

   c:\netware\lsl.com
   c:\netware\ipxodi.com
   c:\netware\netx.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 2.1 and 3.0 of the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP. This problem was corrected in version 3.04.6 of
SMTPGET.EXE. If you do not have version 3.04.6, you can download SMTPGE.EXE, a
self-extracting file, on the following services:
