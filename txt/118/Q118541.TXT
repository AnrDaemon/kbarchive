-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dangerous Creatures may not print correctly to the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet
500 printer if you select the faster (lower quality) print option. The printout
may extend slightly beyond the usable area of the page, and a narrow line may
appear on the left edge of the second sheet of paper.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, print using the slower (and higher quality) print option.
The HP DeskJetC series driver version 4.0 (for all DeskJet models from 500 to
560C) also corrects this problem, but does not provide the option to print in
low resolution in graphics mode.
