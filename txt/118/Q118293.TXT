SYMPTOMS
========

Encarta may stop responding (hang) if you are using the CacheOut control panel.
This problem occurs when trying to open, run, or close MindMaze, the dictionary,
animations, and the orbit simulator.

This problem is due to a conflict between CacheOut and Encarta. For more
information, refer to the Encarta 1994 readme file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, disable CacheOut before using Encarta.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CacheOut is a control panel for 68040 Macintoshes that lets you select specific
