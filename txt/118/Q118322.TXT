TITLE   :PC WSPlus: New Users in Group Cannot Access .CAL File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows allows you to set access to calendar files for
individuals and groups. If you define a group as having access to your calendar
file and you subsequently add new users to that group, the new users will not be
able to access your calendar file.

CAUSE
=====

When you add a group as having access to your calendar file, Schedule+ resolves
that group to the individual names contained within that group. Therefore, any
users added to the group after that will not have access to your calendar file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To assign access privileges to new users, either add the entire group again or
add each group member as you would normally do.
