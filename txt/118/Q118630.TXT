SUMMARY
=======

To display and enter special characters and symbols in FoxPro, you can use the
Macintosh Key Caps desk accessory (DA).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Key Caps DA, normally located on the Apple menu, displays all the characters
available in a font. To display additional characters, press the COMMAND,
OPTION, or SHIFT modifier keys.

To change the font displayed, choose the desired font from the Key Caps menu.

Key Caps is often used for entering special characters such as the copyright,
registration, and trademark symbols, or bullets, arrows, and Greek letters.

Steps to Copy a Character from Key Caps to FoxPro
-------------------------------------------------

This example uses the trademark symbol.

1. From the Apple menu, choose Key Caps.

2. From the Key Caps menu, choose Chicago (or another font).

3. Hold down the OPTION key. Using the mouse, click the trademark symbol. The
   trademark symbol should appear in the text box at the top of the window.

4. Select the trademark symbol in the text box. From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

5. Start FoxPro. Open the window you want to contain the trademark symbol.

6. From the Edit menu, choose Paste.

NOTE: Make sure that the font used in the FoxPro window matches the font selected
in Key Caps; otherwise, the pasted character might not match the character
selected in Key Caps.
