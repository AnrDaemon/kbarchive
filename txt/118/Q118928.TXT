The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Of the factors which affect performance in Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks, hard disk performance is the most important. Both seek time and
throughput of the disk will affect Mail server performance. Virtually every
workstation request requires the Mail server to access the hard disk on the
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Also a large disk cache setting may affect server performance causing the
"Looking for Mail Server ... Give Up" dialog to appear on the workstations
attached to the Mail server. Microsoft Mail version 3.1 ignores caching;
therefore, it is not affected by any cache settings.

Additional query words: 3.00
