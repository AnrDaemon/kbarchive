SYMPTOMS
========

When an application that implements banding calls EndPage(), EndPage() returns
SP_ERROR (-1).

CAUSE
=====

EndPage() returns -1 if there has been no corresponding call to StartPage().
Windows keeps track of whether StartPage() has been called by maintaining an
internal flag that is set when StartPage() is called and then is cleared when
EndPage() is called.

This flag is also cleared when the NEXTBAND escape is called and there are no
more bands on the page to be printed. At this point, Windows clears the internal
flag and tells the device that a page has been finished. Because the internal
flag has been cleared, a subsequent call to EndPage() returns -1.

RESOLUTION
==========

Though EndPage() returns -1 when it is called from printing code that implements
banding, it does no harm. An application can safely call StartPage() and
EndPage() when banding and ignore the -1 error returned from EndPage().

NOTE: It is not recommended that a Win32-based application use banding. Windows
NT, spools in a journal file and Windows 95 spools in an enhanced metafile, so
all GDI calls are supported without banding.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
