The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You do not have access to the COM3 or COM4 port on your Gateway computer.

CAUSE
=====

Some Gateway computers do not release the interrupt when they are finished using
COM1 or COM2, thus preventing Windows 95 from using COM3 or COM4.


WORKAROUND
==========

1. Consult your hardware manual or Gateway Technical Support for assistance
   setting the extended COM port to use an interrupt other than 3 or 4.

   NOTE: Most Gateway computers support IRQ 2, 5, and 7.

2. In Windows 95, use Device Manager to change the settings for the COM port as
   follows:

   a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

   b. Double-click the System icon.

   c. Click the Device Manager tab.

   d. Click the PLUS SIGN (+) to expand the Ports listing, then double- click
      the appropriate communications port.

   e. Click the Resources tab, then double-click the Interrupt Request option.

   f. Choose an IRQ other than 3 or 4.
