======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In ClassWizard, choose the Add Class command button. From the Add Class dialog
box, select the Import Class command button. In the Import Class dialog box,
type the name of a CRecordset-derived class that you would like to import,
specifying the header and implementation files from which to import.


ClassWizard then imports the class so that you can see object IDs and members,
but so that you are not able to bind variables ("Bind All") or update column
information ("Update Columns") from the "Member Variables" tab; this is because
ClassWizard is not aware that the CRecordset-derived class is associated with a
database.

CAUSE
=====

ClassWizard does not copy the database information from the .CLW file associated
with the imported class. That file contains a "DB" section that tells
ClassWizard to look for data source information. If the DB section is missing,
ClassWizard does not enable the Bind All and Update Columns command buttons.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, copy the DB section from the .CLW file that is
associated with the imported CRecordset-derived class to the .CLW file of the
current project. For the Enroll sample, the section should look like this:

   [DB:CSectionSet]
   DB=1
   ColumnCount=6
   Column1=CourseID,1,8,1
   Column2=SectionNo,1,4,1
   Column3=InstructorID,1,8,1
   Column4=RoomNo,1,10,1
   Column5=Schedule,1,24,1
   Column6=Capacity,5,2,1

The DB section for the imported CRecordset-derived class contains the "DB=1" line
as shown and column count and name lines reflecting the correct values for that
class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Visual C++, version
5.0 or later because the Import Class command no longer exists (you can no
longer import a class from an existing source file).

Additional query words: crecordset import add
