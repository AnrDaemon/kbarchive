-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP uuencodes attachments
that contain characters outside the ASCII character set. Because the
Microsoft Word formatting characters are outside the ASCII character set,
the SMTP Gateway uuencodes attached files save in Word format.

Word as:
 

 - MS-DOS text

 - text only

 - text only with linebreaks

 - MS-DOS text with linebreaks

 - MS-DOS text with layout

 - text with layout

 - rich text format

The uuencode used is SUN's version 5. This is not configurable.
