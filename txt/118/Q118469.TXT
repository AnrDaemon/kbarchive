The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 4.0

Microsoft has NetWare client software available for Windows NT to permit
access to Novell NetWare servers and NetWare resources. This software
installs as either Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway services
for NetWare (GSNW), depending on whether you install on Windows NT or
Windows NT Advanced Server.

GSNW includes a gateway feature that allows Microsoft networking clients to
access files through the Windows NT Advanced Server computer that reside on
NetWare servers without having to load additional NetWare connectivity
components on the client.

The file gateway uses a NetWare account to create an authenticated
connection to the NetWare server from the Windows NT gateway computer. All
file access will be done in the context of this connection. The NetWare
account MUST be a member of the NetWare NTGATEWAY group. This group must
first be created on the NetWare server and the gateway account added to
this group before trying to establish the file gateway.

It is not necessary for the gateway account or the NTGATEWAY group to have
supervisor rights.

The NetWare product discussed here is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
