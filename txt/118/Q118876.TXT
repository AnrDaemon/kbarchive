======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a menu is specified for the dialog-box template of a CFormView, then a
permanent USER resource leak occurs.

CAUSE
=====

A CFormView object uses a dialog-box template with a child style. It is not
valid for a child window to have a menu. If a menu is specified for a child
window, the menu will be created when the template is created but it will not be
attached to the CFormView and it will therefore not be destroyed when the
CFormView object is destroyed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure none of the dialog-box templates for your CFormView objects have menus
specified for them. To assist in this endeavor, starting with Visual C++, 32-bit
Edition, version 4.0, the Dialog Editor will disable the Menu option on the
Dialog Properties dialog box if the loaded dialog template has the Child style
(WS_CHILD).
