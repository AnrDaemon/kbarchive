TITLE   :BUG: Sample MTTEST.FOR Compile Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compile the multithread example MTTEST.FOR, the compiler generates the
following error messages:

   MTTEST.FOR(12) : error F2328: CREATETHREAD : already typed
   MTTEST.FOR(12) : error F2328: WAITFORMULTIPLEOBJECTS : already typed
   MTTEST.FOR(19) : error F2611: CREATETHREAD : formal argument THREAD_FUNC :
   actual not subprogram

CAUSE
=====

The sample program contains two errors.

 - CreateThread() and WaitForMultipleObjects() are declared. This is not
   necessary, because the correct declarations are already in the include file,
   MT.FD.

 - CreateThread() is passed the location of the routine rather than the routine
   itself.

RESOLUTION
==========

The CreateThread() and WaitForMultipleObjects() declarations are not needed and
should be removed. Delete the line 12 from MTTEST.FOR:

   integer*4   CreateThread, WaitForMultipleObjects

CreateThread() expects a subprogram, not a location. Remove the syntax "LOC()"
from line 19 of MTTEST.FOR:

   handle(i) = CreateThread (0, 0, LOC (Task), temp(i), 0, myid)

After the correction is made, the line will be as follows:

   handle(i) = CreateThread (0, 0, Task, temp(i), 0, myid)

In addition to the actual errors, the program takes an unnecessarily long time to
run. The number of milliseconds it waits in the "task" routine should be reduced
from 10000 to 1000 or less. In MTTEST.FOR, change

   call sleepqq(10000*seq)

-to-

   call sleepqq(1000*seq)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for
Windows NT, version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
