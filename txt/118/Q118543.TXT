TITLE   :Dangerous Creatures: Hot Spots No Longer Hot When You Return
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are in a guided tour, you may find that some hot spots are no longer
hot when you return to them.

NOTE: A hot spot is colored text (jump text) that when clicked with your mouse
moves you to a related topic. A hot spot can also be a specific part of the
program that when the mouse cursor is laying over the top of an element
(typically resembling a small hand) the program plays a sound, opens a menu, or
moves to another part of the program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Dangerous Creatures version 1.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the Main screen, choose Guides.

2. From the Guides screen, choose Male & Female Roles.

3. Proceed through the guided tour until you reach the Lion screen.

4. Choose the Back button. This returns you to the Lioness pop-up (titled "The
   Huntress").

5. Click the Lion screen, partially visible behind the Lioness pop-up.

Dangerous Creatures returns to the Lion screen, but the text "Make mine meat" is
no longer a hot spot. If you pass the mouse pointer over the former hot spot, it
does not turn into a hand icon. If you click on it, nothing happens. This
problem also occurs in other guided tours.
