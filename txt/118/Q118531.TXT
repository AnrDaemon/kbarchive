======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (FFAPI), version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In File Format API (FFAPI), version 3.0, GTWGET allows you to specify which
Microsoft Mail post office to "get" messages from, and extracts all FFAPI
messages for all FFAPI-defined networks and post offices. This option is not
documented in the version 3.0 manual.

CAUSE
=====

Documentation error.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the beginning of your command line options, specify the network and post
office name. Follow this example:

   gtwget network1/po3 -dq -auser:password c:\filename.out

This command checks the network "network1," post office "po3" for outgoing mail
and places it in a file called FILENAME.OUT.

Place the network/postoffice option FIRST on the command line, before any other
options.
