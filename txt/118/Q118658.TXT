SYMPTOMS
========

After entering footnotes in Word version 6.0 RTF files with the New Viewer
Element dialog box, individual characters in the text immediately following the
footnote symbol are not selectable.

The following Viewer elements are affected:

   (#) Topic
   (#) Context String
   ($) Topic Title
   (!) Topic Entry Command
   (+) Topic Groups
   (*) Build Tags
   (K) Keywords

Other Viewer elements remain unaffected.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can enter footnotes for Viewer elements by following these steps:

1. From the Insert menu, choose Footnote.

2. Choose Custom Mark.

3. Enter the mark that corresponds to the Viewer element you want to use.

4. Choose OK. (You should now be in the Footnote section of the Word 6.0 main
   window.)

5. Enter the text that is to be associated with the footnote.

6. Close the Footnote section and resume editing the document.

Using the macro facility in Word 6.0, you can create a macro to automate these
steps. Please refer to your Word 6.0 documentation for information concerning
creating and using macros.
