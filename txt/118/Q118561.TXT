The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

EXTERNAL.EXE does not pick up mail from a particular outgoing gateway or
indirect mail queue set up to be indirect through a secondary post office.

CAUSE
=====

There are two possible causes of this problem:

1. External has not been restarted since changes were made to the post office.

2. The "indirect network," "post office" or "MBG" sections in the NETWORK.GLB
   file contain inproper information. (It has to have been inserted manually.)

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Restart External.

2. Check the values in the NETWORK.GLB file and the associated XTN for the
   Indirect NET/PO/MBG value to ensure all are correct. The NETWORK.GLB format
   is:

      Gateway/network name
      MBG/XTN pointer
      Optional MBG pointer making above XTN pointer(SNADS/PROFS)
      Indirect
          Network name
          Post office name
          MBG value

The MBG value and name must match the NETWORK entry values for the indirect
network definition as well as the post office and MBG values from the associated
XTN file.

Additional query words: po postoffice
