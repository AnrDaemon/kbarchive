The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SNADS, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The LinkAge or Soft*Switch SNADS Gateway sends each Microsoft Mail attachment as
a separate message. This can cause multiple messages if you send a Microsoft
Mail loopback message--one sent through the gateway and routed back to the
sender, or sent to another Microsoft Mail user on the other end of the SNADS
Gateway.

If you send a loopback message from the Windows client with two attachments, you
receive four messages: two with one attachment each, one with the WINMAIL.DAT
attachment, and the fourth with the message body.

If you send a loopback message with one OLE object, you receive two messages: one
with the OLE object, the other with the message body.

If you send a loopback message with two OLE objects, you receive two messages:
one with both OLE objects, the other with the message body.
