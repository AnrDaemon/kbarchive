SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to access the Encarta dictionary from within Encarta, you may
receive the error message:

   Encarta Must Be Loaded To Use Dictionary!

Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs that modify the title bar of Encarta
may cause this problem. Typically, these TSRs add information to the title bar,
such as the current time or the amount of available system resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not load these TSR programs using Encarta. These types of TSRs will normally
load either through the RUN= or LOAD= lines in the WIN.INI file, or through the
Startup group in Windows.

To disable TSRs in the WIN.INI file:

1. Open the WIN.INI file in a text editor such as Notepad.

2. If anything is listed on the LOAD= or RUN= lines, place a ";" (a semicolon
   without the quotation marks) before the lines. This prevents the information
   on these lines from loading.
