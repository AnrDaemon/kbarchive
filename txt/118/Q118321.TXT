TITLE   :PC DB: Gateway Addresses and Template Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, templates can be used to
create a directory of customized user information. However, template information
is not allowed for certain address types. The types of addresses that do not
support templates are: MCI, X400, SMTP, MHS, 3COM, and FAX.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is not currently supported by the product. Gateways that use a .GLB or .NME
file to store their addresses (for example, X.400, SMTP, MHS, FAX, MCI, and
3COM) cannot support extended information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Gateways that store addresses in conformance with the 10/10/10 format(for
example, SNADS and PROFS) support extended information.
