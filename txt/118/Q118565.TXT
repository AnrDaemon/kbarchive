-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail to X.400 Gateway supports these body-part types: IA5,
T61/TTX, binary, and (in version 3.2 only) ISO6937. You can use the BODYPART.CFG
file (in version 3.2, use the X.400 Admin program) to encode any file as any of
these body-part types.

For example, if the BODYPART.CFG file contains the entry,

   *.bmp IA5

then any attached bitmap files are tagged as a IA5 body-parts in the message,
even though the .bmp file contains characters that fall outside the IA5
character set. This allows the Microsoft Mail to X.400 Gateway to interoperate
more easily with implementations that support only IA5 type body-parts.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.20 bodypart
