MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains MOVEUSER.EXE, a replacement for the MOVEUSER.EXE file that
is included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This update
corrects the following problem:

 - Users moved from one postoffice to another postoffice with the MOVEUSER
   utility are assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB file on
   the destination postoffice is locked open. Moving multiple users while the
   TID.GLB file is locked open results in the same invalid identification number
   being assigned to multiple users. When Mail is addressed to one of these
   users, the other users with the same invalid identification number also get
   added to the recipients list. To avoid this problem, the MOVEUSER version
   3.2.8 update will not move a user if the TID.GLB file is locked open.
