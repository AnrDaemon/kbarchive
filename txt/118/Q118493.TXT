TITLE   :Long Filenames Cause Problems with Earlier Versions of MS-DOS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:diskmem win95 kbDiskMemory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

One or more of the following symptoms occur while you are running MS-DOS 6.22 or
earlier:

 - In a directory listing, the volume label is reported incorrectly.

 - When you try to remove a partition, Fdisk reports the following error:

   Volume label does not match

 - The Label command reports the following error when changing the volume
   label:

   Cannot make directory entry

 - Symantec Norton Disk Doctor reports files with names such as AA, AB, and AT
   are too long or too short. Nothing is corrected when Norton Disk Doctor tries
   to fix the files.

   NOTE: The SCANDISK command in Windows 95 reports no errors.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Windows 95 stores long filename information in directory entries
adjacent to the file being stored. These directory entries have the Read- Only,
Hidden, System, and Volume Label attributes set. Earlier versions of MS-DOS
recognize these entries as the volume label. As long as you continue to run
Windows 95 and use long filenames, the volume label is unchangeable.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have removed Windows 95 from your system and want to correct the volume
label, use one of the following procedures:

Windows 95 Startup Disk Method
------------------------------

1. Obtain a Windows 95 Startup Disk that contains the LABEL.EXE command line
   utility for Windows 95.

2. Boot with the Startup Disk and type the following command:

   " label <drive>: " (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the drive with the unusual volume label.

3. When prompted, enter a new volume label.

NOTE: If this procedure does not work, then the MS-DOS 6.x method below must be
used.

MS-DOS 6.x Method
-----------------

1. Back up your hard disk.

2. Reformat the disk. For example, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and then press ENTER

   " format <drive>: /s /v:<label name> " (without the quotation
   marks)

   where <drive> is the drive with the unusual volume label and <label
   name> is the new volume name you want to use.

3. Restore your files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most disk utilities need to be updated to function properly with long
filenames.
