PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you press CTRL+ALT+DEL to reboot and then try to use the Sound Blaster or
Media Vision Pro Audio "SCSI" CD-ROM drive, Windows 95 stops responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

If your system hangs and you have to press CTRL+ALT+DEL, the system may not find
the CD-ROM drive after rebooting. If this occurs, trying to use the CD-ROM
causes the system to hang again.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, press the reset button on your computer or turn off
the computer and then turn it on again. To avoid this problem, load only the
protected-mode drivers for the Sound Blaster or Media Vision Pro Audio on-board
"SCSI" interface proprietary CD-ROM devices.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Windows 95 is relying on real-mode drivers for the Sound Blaster or Media
Vision Pro Audio on-board CD-ROM interface, sometimes CTRL+ALT+DEL does not
reset this interface. If so, you no longer have access to anything on the CD-ROM
because its drivers were unable to load.
