TITLE   :ANNOUNCE and ANNDELTA Entries in Registry are Ignored
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Announce and Anndelta entries in the Registry in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1 are ignored. These entries are located in the
Registry under:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ 
      SYSTEM\ 
         CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters.

The Resource Kit for Windows NT states these keys are used to tune the Lanman
Server portion of Windows NT. However, changing these entries has no effect on
the performance of Windows NT.

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
