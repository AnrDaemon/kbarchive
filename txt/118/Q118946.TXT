SUMMARY
=======

The file RNETSEM.GLB contains one long integer (4 bytes) and is used for
synchronizing the generation of RNETWORK.GLB by the External mail program. On a
new postoffice (PO), the first run of the External mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE)
will create this file. The file data is read into memory and stored.

When the rebuild interval for RNETWORK.GLB is reached, the value of this file is
checked again. If it matches the copy in memory, it implies that no update has
occurred, and the External mail program can proceed with the update. External
will, on completion of the update, increment the value of the long integer
stored in RNETSEM.GLB and save it.

If the checked value is different from the value in memory, it implies that
another External mail program has already performed a rebuild, so the new value
is saved, and the rebuild is skipped.
