======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to load an application, Windows 95 may report one of the following
error messages

   Win32 Loader Error
   Win32 Exec App unable to find C:\<directory\filename>

   where <directory\filename> is the executable file you were trying to
   start.

-or-

   Error Starting Program
   There is not enough memory to start (filename). Quit some programs, and then
   try again.

You may receive the following error when you try to close a 32-bit application,
such as WordPad:

   Insufficient memory to perform operation.

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur when the virtual memory settings are too low. They occur more
often on systems with less than 8 megabytes (MB) of extended memory available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, increase the virtual memory settings. If the maximum
setting is already set, you may need to choose a different hard disk or remove
files from the current hard disk chosen to increase the amount of disk space
reserved for extra memory. You can increase the amount of hard disk space
reserved for extra memory by performing the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then click Virtual Memory.

4. Click the "Let me specify my own virtual memory settings" option.

5. Adjust the Hard Disk, Minimum, and Maximum settings as necessary.

6. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum recommended amount of hard disk space reserved for extra memory is 5
MB. Windows 95 dynamically allocates available disk space for use as extra
memory when applications demand it.
