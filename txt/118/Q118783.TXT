The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 2.1 and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail to X.400 Gateway strip the header
information from return receipts generated by Microsoft Mail for Windows.

The MS-DOS client for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks puts the receipt information
in the body of the message, so it is not lost when the gateway strips the
header. The Windows client, however, puts receipt information in the message
header, so it is lost when the header is stripped by the gateway, and the
recipient gets a blank message with the boilerplate subject.

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail to X.400 Gateway checks the header of each message
to see if it is a Windows client receipt and, if it is, includes the header
(with receipt information) in the outgoing message.

Receipts from the MS-DOS and Windows clients look different, but both contain all
essential information.
