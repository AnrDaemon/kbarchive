SUMMARY
=======

On page 377 of version 3.2 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks and on page 237 of
version 3.5 "Administrator's Guide," under the section heading "Specifying a
File with the Administrator Program," the following incorrect statement
appears:

   NOTE: A Script file specified in the External-Admin Setup screen Phone number
   field overrides both the default script file and a script file specified in
   the External program .INI file with the CommScript option or the -tname
   command line option.

The correct order of precedence is listed on page 237. The command-line option
takes precedence over the .INI entry that takes precedence over the Admin
program script file setting.

External will run the commands it finds last. It checks the following locations
in this order:

1. The Administrator program

2. The Dynamic Drive Administration program

3. The global section in the .INI file

4. The instance specific section in the .INI file

5. The command-line option

6. Modem script file
