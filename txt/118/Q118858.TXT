SUMMARY
=======

The domain-defined attribute value (DDA value) should be used when a mail system
requires address mapping to some component of the X.400 originator/recipient
(O/R) name. In SMTP mail systems, the DDA value usually contains the SMTP
address of the recipient. Since the @ character is illegal for X.400 O/R name
values, you should enter the SMTP address this way:

   DDA.Value=recipient(a)domain.com

where the (a) character takes the place of the @ character.

Additional query words: 2.10 3.00 3.20
