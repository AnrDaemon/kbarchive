TITLE   :Mixed TrueType Text and Graphics Print Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print combined TrueType text and graphics from an application to a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 or DeskJet 1200C, the color of the text and
background do not appear as expected.

For example, if you print a Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0 slide with the
SOARINGS.PPT background using the default screen colors of yellow text on a blue
background, the text does not appear, the blue portion appears yellow, and the
light blue portion appears white.


CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT printer driver uses the TrueType font resident in the HP LaserJet
4 or DeskJet 1200c printer, instead of sending the TrueType font to the printer
as a graphic.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5.

The DeskJet and LaserJet printers described here are manufactured by
Hewlett-Packard, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied
or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
