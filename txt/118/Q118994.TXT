TITLE   :FAX: ErrMsg: Cannot Find or Open M:\FAX\*.ICX file
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an incoming fax image is received, the Microsoft Mail Gateway to FAX may
generate the error message "Cannot find or open *.ICX" if you are using the
spool printing option on a Novell Netware network. (The option sends the fax
image to the printer on receipt. When it is on, the PROFILE.GLB file has the
FAXIn Mode set to SPOOL orVIEW+SPOOL.)

CAUSE
=====

The FAX Gateway spawns the program MAKEDCX.EXE and generates the *.ICX file,
which the PPB.EXE program uses to print the fax image. The error indicates that
the MAKEDCX.EXE program is failing to create or open the *.ICX file because the
network operating system is not finding the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Novell MAP ROOT command to define the Microsoft Mail database and
executables drives and directories to be at the root level.
