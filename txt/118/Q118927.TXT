The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

An administrator of a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice can use the Mail
Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) to set two different kinds of passwords. Each
postoffice will have one password to control dial-in access to the postoffice,
and each mailbox will have a password to provide security for the users' mail.
This article provides information about the two kinds of passwords and how you
can change them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sections below list the ADMIN.EXE program commands you can use to manage
these passwords. For information about how to start the Mail Administrator
program, please see the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "Administrator's Guide."

Postoffice Password Commands
----------------------------

The following command

   Config, Password, Sign-on password to this postoffice:

sets the postoffice password to provide security for dial-in access via modem
(for example, Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows users, or when you use the
External Mail program with a postoffice connected via modem.)

For additional information about setting passwords using the Mail Remote client,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q97894 PC WRmt: Remote Mail Password Dialogs

When you add an external postoffice and configure it as a direct route type via
modem, use the following command to specify the password for the external
postoffice it will dial to:

   " External-Admin, Setup, Enter network name:, Password " (without the
   quotation marks)

You do not need a password for indirect route postoffices or direct route
postoffices via an MS-DOS drive.

Mailbox Password Commands
-------------------------

The following command

   Local-Admin, Options, Password, Password:

is the default password for new users. If you would like the default password for
the postoffice to be something other than "password," you can change it here.

When you create a new mailbox, the "Password:" field contains the default
password. You can change the password with the following command

   Local-Admin, Create, Mailbox name:, Password:

or let the user change it using Microsoft Mail for Windows.

If a user forgets his or her password, you can reset it to the default using the
command:

   Local-Admin, Recover, <mailbox name>, Yes

To change the password for a mailbox that already exists, you must use
appropriate client software:

   Client                  Command
   ---------------------------------------------
   MS-DOS                  Options, Password
   Windows                 Mail, Change Password
   Macintosh               File, Change Password
   Presentation Manager    Mail, Change Password

In each product, you will be asked to enter the old password, then enter the new
password twice for verification.
