-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Application FFAPI and Gateway FFAPI are similar in that they allow you to
send/receive messages from/to an MMFF (Microsoft Mail File Format) file. They
differ in that Application FFAPI sends/receives messages as a single Microsoft
Mail user while Gateway FFAPI sends/receives messages as a pseudo Microsoft Mail
postoffice. This difference makes Application FFAPI resemble the MS-DOS client.

APPPUT.EXE (or the large-model version, LAPPPUT.EXE) allows you to "put" an MMF
file message into the Microsoft Mail database, where it is treated the same as
any other message. For example:

   APPPUT -iname:password -dm -f2 xyz.txt

APPGET.EXE (or the large model version, LAPPGET.EXE) allows you to "get" a
message from the Microsoft Mail database and put it into an MMFF file. For
example:

   APPGET -iname:password -dm -f2 xyz.txt

APPDIR.EXE (or the large model version, LAPPDIR.EXE) allows you to get a
postoffice address list from the Mail system and place it in an output file. For
example:

   APPDIR -iname:password -dm -leNET/PO1 xyz.txt
