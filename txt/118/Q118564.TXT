The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is how to save the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP post office address
list and the current SMTP setup configuration information when you re-
install SMTP or move from version 2.1 to 3.0:
 

1. Save the SMTP Address List: Extract the address list from the gateway post
   office before you remove any portion of the gateway. Use the Import program
   with the -X and -GSMTP options to specify extract and address type of SMTP.
   The -F specifies a text file to be created with these names.

   For example:

   Import -x -gsmtp -fsmtplist.txt admin -ppassword -dm

   Where SMTPLIST.TXT is a text file of all SMTP names and the post office
   resides on drive M.

2. Save Configuration: Save M:\SMTP\*.CFG files to another location, besides the
   \SMTP subdirectory (this saves your configuration files, so you do not have
   to reconfigure the gateway). Use the MS-DOS Copy command.

3. Remove and Re-Install the SMTP gateway:

   a. Insert the SMTP access diskette ("MS Mail Gateway Access for SMTP") into a
      floppy drive and type "install-r" (without the quotation marks) [ENTER].

   b. Insert the SMTP gateway diskette ("MS Mail Gateway to SMTP") into a floppy
      drive and type "install-r" (without the quotation marks) [ENTER].

   c. Connect to the post office you now want as the Gateway post office.

   d. Insert the SMTP gateway diskette ("MS Mail Gateway to SMTP") into a floppy
      drive and type "install" (without the quotation marks) [ENTER].

   e. Insert the SMTP access diskette ("MS Mail Gateway Access for SMTP") into a
      floppy drive and type "install" (without the quotation marks) [ENTER].

4. Restore the SMTP Address List: Import the list of names created in the first
   step. This places all the SMTP names on the new or udpated post office.

   For example:

   Import -gsmtp -fsmtpname.txt admin -ppassword -dn

   Where SMTPLIST.TXT contains the SMTP names and the new post office is off the
   N drive.

5. Restore configuration: Copy previously saved *.CFG files to the new post
   office database, in \SMTP\*.CFG. Check the configuration in the Admin
   program. You can use the MS-DOS Copy command to accomplish this.
