The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to set up a NetWare gateway on Windows NT Advanced Server, the
following error message may appear when you add a share:

   Login failure. Account restriction.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by using a NetWare user account that has Limit Concurrent
Connections set to Yes under Account Restrictions in SYSCON, and that user
account has exceeded the maximum number of concurrent connections it is allowed
to have. For example the Maximum Connections is set to 1 and the user is already
logged on to Windows NT and has a drive connection to the NetWare server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do one of the following:

 - Use an account that is reserved for the gateway account and not an existing
   user's account.

   -or-

 - Increase the maximum number of concurrent connections for that user account
   using SYSCON.

   -or-

 - Set Limit Concurrent Connections to No for that user account using SYSCON.
