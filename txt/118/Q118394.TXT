TITLE   :$DEBUG Modifies Behavior of SELECT CASE in PowerStation 1.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The description of the SELECT CASE construct in the "Language Guide" states that
if the test expression does not match any of the cases and there is no default
case, execution proceeds after the END SELECT. However, the documents fail to
mention that $DEBUG modifies this behavior. The description for $DEBUG states
that an error message is generated for test expressions that do not match any of
the CASEs; this error message reads as follows:

   run-time error F6105 $DEBUG
   - no matching CASE found for SELECT CASE

MORE INFORMATION
================

To generate the debug message, compile and run the sample code below. Type
anything other than 0 or 1 at the prompt. The program runs without error if the
CASE DEFAULT lines are uncommented.

NOTE: You can use compiler option /4Yb instead of the $DEBUG metacommand.

Sample Code
-----------

   c compile options needed: none

      $DEBUG
            INTEGER I
            write (*,'(A,\)') ' Enter selection <0 or 1>: '
            READ (*,*) I
            SELECT CASE (I)
            CASE (0)
               WRITE(*,*) 'First case: I =',i
            CASE (1)
               WRITE(*,*) 'Second case: I =',i
      c      CASE DEFAULT
      c         WRITE(*,*) 'Default case I =',i
            END SELECT
            END
