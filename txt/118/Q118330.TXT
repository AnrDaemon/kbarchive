SUMMARY
=======

The VersionInfo resource for the Driver Manager and Cursor Library contains,
among other properties, a property called CursorLevel. This article explains the
purpose of CursorLevel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The VersionInfo resource for ODBC.DLL (ODBC Driver Manager) and ODBCCURS.DLL
(ODBC Cursor Library) can be viewed using File Manager by selecting the File
Menu and choosing Properties.

The property called CursorLevel is a mechanism to guarantee that the right
versions of the Driver Manager and Cursor Library are used together. The
CursorLevel is not related to any of the ODBC API Levels.

If the CursorLevel of the ODBC Driver Manager is "d" and a Cursor Library with a
CursorLevel of "g" is used, the ODBC Driver Manager will not load the Cursor
Library. The message from the cursor library is:

   SQLState 01000: Cursor library not used. Version mismatch with Driver Manager

The following are the CurorLevels for different versions of the ODBC Driver
Manager and Cursor Library that have been shipped:
