TITLE   :S3 Video on Certain Dell Computers is Limited to 256 Colors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Although the S3 drivers shipped with Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT
Server version 3.5 support more than 256 colors on computers that have the S3
801, 805, or 928 chip set, the RAMDAC on some Dell computers limits the colors
displayed to 32K colors. Microsoft does not provide a 32K color driver for the
S3 chip set; therefore, 256 is the maximum color depth on these computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The computers affected by this limitation are the Dell 4xx/L, 4xx/M, 4xx/T, and
the 4xx/ME. Some of these computers also come configured with Tseng chip sets
and are therefore not affected by this limitation.

The Dell products discussed here are manufactured by Dell Computer Corp., a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
