======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dangerous Creatures for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you choose the Back button in Dangerous Creatures, you may not return to
the screen you saw most recently. Choosing Back may skip a screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This occurs because the Back feature does not include pop-up screens. Instead,
Dangerous Creatures returns to the most recently viewed main screen.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From the Main screen, click Weapons.

2. In the Weapons screen, click Jaws.

3. In the Jaws screen, click Wolf.

4. In the Wolf screen, click the Back button.

Instead of returning to the Jaws screen, Dangerous Creatures returns to the
Weapons screen.

This occurs because the Back feature does not include pop-up screens. The Jaws
screen is a pop-up screen, whereas the Weapons screen is a main screen.
