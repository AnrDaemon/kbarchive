SUMMARY
=======

The information found in the "Creator File Types" topic in the online Help files
incorrectly refers to "Creator File Types."

Creators and file types are actually two different components of a file within
the Macintosh operating system.

For example, the column headings in the table in the Help file should read as
follows:

   File Type          FoxPro Files          File Extension
   -------------------------------------------------------

   F+DB               Table                 .DBF
