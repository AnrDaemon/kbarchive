MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not exhibit itself until the combined number of attachments
and recipients reaches some unspecified limit. In many cases, reducing the
number of attachments or recipients will eliminate the problem. In extreme
cases, only one attachment may be sent to any specific group of recipients.

This problem is more prone to show when connecting multiple postoffices via Async
or X.25 communications, running the MS-DOS version of EXTERNAL.EXE.
