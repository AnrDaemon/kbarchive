======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

 - When you copy an image onto the Clipboard (using CUT, COPY, or Print Screen)
   and then paste that image into Publisher's Paintbrush 2.0, you receive a
   general protection (GP) fault.

 - Selecting an unavailable font in Publisher's Paintbrush 2.0 generates a GP
   fault.

 - When you run Publisher's Paintbrush 2.0 under Windows 95, you see a window
   title that displays only the letter "W."

CAUSE
=====

GP Fault When Pasting an Image
------------------------------

Publisher's Paintbrush 2.0 expects the Clipboard to contain a device- independent
bitmap (DIB). If a DIB is present, Publisher's Paintbrush 2.0 assumes that it is
a 1-, 8-, or 24-bit bitmap. If a 4-bit DIB is on the Clipboard, a GP fault
occurs.

GP Fault When Selecting Unavailable Font
----------------------------------------

This problem is caused by a limitation in Publisher's Paintbrush 2.0.

Window Title with Only the Letter "W" Visible
---------------------------------------------

This particular window is known as a "child window" and should read "Width." This
child window is of a fixed sized; therefore, it cannot be changed. You cannot
read the entire word "Width" because Windows 95 adds the Close button in the
upper-right corner of the window.

RESOLUTION
==========

For information about whether the latest version of PC Paintbrush corrects these
problems, contact SoftKey.
