TITLE   :PC Ext: External Won't Dial Out Unless There Is Outbound Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.2,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) to transfer mail between
postoffices that are connected via modem, the External Mail program may not dial
out to pick up mail from the other postoffice even though it is configured for
twoway transfer and there is mail waiting to be picked up.

CAUSE
=====

There is no outbound mail. The External Mail program only dials out if there is
outbound mail.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is a limitation of the External Mail program. The messages waiting at the
other postoffice will be transferred to the destination if the External Mail
program at the other postoffice is permitted to transmit messages. However, when
there are dial-up restrictions, you can create outbound mail messages so
External will dial out and pick up waiting messages. You can do this by using
the AUTOSEND MAPI application that is provided in the SAMPLE.EXE file included
with the MAPI.DLL update, MAPIUPD.EXE.
