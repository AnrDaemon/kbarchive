-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Message Transfer Agent (MTA) included with version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks is an MS-DOS application (it is a single tasking
application). You can obtain a multitasking version that runs on OS/2. Updates
to .DLLs and new executable files are released periodically to enhance the
performance of the Mail product and to fix problems. All of the updates are
bound applications and will run on MS-DOS or OS/2. This article lists the
updates for the MTA function that can be used with the MMTA.

NOTE: DISPATCH.EXE is not a bound application. There is a MS-DOS version and an
OS/2 version.

All the updates are bound applications except for the EXTERNAL.EXE file for OS/2
(MMTA). You can obtain the Application Note WA0975 "Microsoft Mail EXTERNAL.EXE
Update for OS/2 Mail Multitasking MTA" only from Microsoft Product Support
Services.
