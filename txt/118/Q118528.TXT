SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail has default polling intervals that are used to check for new
mail. You can control how often the workstation polls the database to check for
new mail.

The following table lists the mail clients, their polling defaults, and how to
reset them.

   Presentation Manager        5 seconds      -N command-line option

IMPORTANT: For the Windows workstation, the administrator can set the default
polling value with the PollingInterval variable in the MSMAIL.INI template file
that is stored in the Mail executables directory on the server (or in some
cases, in the user's Windows directory). The user must modify the Check For New
Mail option from the Options menu from the Windows workstation. This value is
stored in the user's Mail message file (MMF) and the MSMAIL.INI value is ignored
after the MMF is created.
