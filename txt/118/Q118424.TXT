-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you sign in to Schedule+ for Windows for Workgroups, one of the following
error messages appears even though the mailbox name and password are correctly
specified in the Mail Sign-In dialog box:

   The mailbox name or password is incorrect.

   -or-

   Your passwords don't match. Type your schedule file password.

CAUSE
=====

If Schedule+ is started offline the first time the program is run, the following
message is displayed after the calendar file is created:

                    Microsoft Schedule+

   A new file has been created for you. Your password has been set to
   'PASSWORD'. You can change it by using the Change Password command.

Schedule+ uses the default password "PASSWORD" (without the quotation marks) to
access the calendar file. If Schedule+ is started offline the first time the
program is run, the password is set to the default one regardless of the
password selected by the user.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you start Schedule+ by using the default password, you can change the
password to any one you want. To change the password, choose Change Password
from the Options menu. The original password is then requested. Type "PASSWORD"
(without the quotation marks). The old password appears as asterisks as you type
it. Choose OK. Enter a new password. Confirmation of the new password is then
requested.
