SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose the copy button below the picture of a flag, the flag flashes
momentarily. This occurs because Encarta is selecting, copying, and deselecting
the flag. However, this behavior does not occur when copying any other kind of
image.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Encarta 1994 for the Macintosh.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
