The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a printer on a Windows NT Advanced Server computer, you have the
option to capture the printer so that Macintosh workstations cannot access it
directly. If you try to do this, the Macintosh Chooser displays two printer
queues for the same printer. One queue is displayed under the name you created
on the Windows NT server and the other is displayed as a normal Macintosh
printer.

CAUSE
=====

Some printers, including the LaserWriter IIf and IIg, refuse a connection at
certain wait time-outs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT Server version 3.5.
