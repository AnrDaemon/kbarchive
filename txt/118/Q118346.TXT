TITLE   :Printer Driver Imaging Options Do Not Function Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the imaging options (such as, "Print as a Negative Image," "Print as a
Mirror Image," and "Compress Bitmap Images") through the PostScript printer
driver does not work properly.

CAUSE
=====

Some applications bypass the PostScript printer driver and download their own
information to the printer.

NOTE: Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows and CorelDRAW are known to do this.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rather than setting these options through the printer driver, set them through
the application.

Additional query words: pscript ps 3rdparty
