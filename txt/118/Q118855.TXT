The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MODEM.GLB file is used by the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks message
transfer agent, EXTERNAL.EXE, and contains the local serial port information for
the postoffice. When corruption in the MODEM.GLB file is suspected, the file
should be reset with the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the MODEM.GLB file becomes corrupt, EXTERNAL.EXE may have difficulty
initializing and controlling the modem when transferring mail via asynchronous
communications. To reset the MODEM.GLB file:

1. Locate MODEM.GLB in the GLB subdirectory of MAILDATA and rename it to
   MODEMGLB.SAV.

2. Start ADMIN.EXE and select Config, Serial to set the appropriate baud rate,
   dialing mode, and COM port for the local modem. Exiting this screen will
   create another MODEM.GLB file in the GLB subdirectory.

NOTE: Choosing the Serial command from the Config menu in ADMIN.EXE allows the
administrator to define the parameters that control data communications with
postoffices on external networks and Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows users.
These settings determine how the local modem and serial port will be initialized
by EXTERNAL.EXE.

The functions available under the Serial command are:

Baud Rate
---------

   Choose the baud rate or transmission speed for the COM port utilized by the
   local modem. The default baud rate is 1200 baud.

Mode
----

   Choose the telephone dialing mode that the local modem is using. Normally the
   dialing mode will be touch tone.

COM Port
--------

   Choose the communication port to which the local modem is connected. The
   default is COM1.

When you have finished setting the serial parameters, press ESC to return to the
Config menu.
