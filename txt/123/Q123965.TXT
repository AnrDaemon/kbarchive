TITLE   :Can't Get Zone Information with Compaq Netflex II TR NIC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Compaq Netflex II Token Ring (TR) network interface card (NIC) on
a Windows NT 3.5 server, you are not able to get zone information. Macintosh
clients cannot see Windows NT 3.5 servers that use this NIC from Chooser. You
cannot get zone information either when you are first configuring zones during
the installation of Services for Macintosh, or later, after restarting the
server or Services for Macintosh.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the way functional addresses (TR equivalent of a
multicast address) are added. There is no problem if the driver is written so it
completes calls synchronously. However, if a driver is written so calls are made
asynchronously, the request buffer becomes corrupted and no routing information
is passed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version
3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
