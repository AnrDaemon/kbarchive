BUG# ADDON_BUGS: 10688 (2.00.1912)

SYMPTOMS
========

On a machine with the components from Microsoft Windows 32-bit Software
Development Kit (WIN32S) installed, the version 4.21a ODBC/SQL Server 16- bit
driver installation will fail because the 32-bit Thunking Driver Manager is not
present on the installation diskette but is indicated as one of the files to be
installed in ODBC.INF. This needs to be included on the installation diskette
for ODBC setup to properly complete.

CAUSE
=====

The 32-bit Thunking Driver Manager needs to be included on the 4.21a ODBC
installation diskette for ODBC setup to complete properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

Obtain the 32-bit Thunking Driver Manager (ODBC32.DLL) from the ODBC Software
Development Kit (SDK) version 2.01a available from the MSDN Level 2 CD and in
the \ODBCSDK\REDIST6 directory of the installed SDK. Copy this ODBC32.DLL on to
your installation diskette, and then run the ODBC installation again. This
should allow the ODBC installation to complete.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC SQL Server driver
version 2.00.1912, included with SQL Server version 4.21a. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
