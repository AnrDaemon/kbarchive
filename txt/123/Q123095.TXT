======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may occur when you start Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11:

   Invalid VxD dynamic link call to device # 0484, service 800D. Your Windows
   configuration is invalid. Run the Windows Setup program again to correct this
   problem.

After receiving this message, you cannot enter Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is caused by either a corrupted IFSMGR.386 file, or a missing
device line in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this error, verify that the device line exists in the SYSTEM.INI
file. If necessary, edit the SYSTEM.INI file with a text editor, such as Windows
Notepad or MS-DOS Editor, and add the following line to the [386Enh] section:

   device=ifsmgr.386

Then, expand the file from your original Windows for Workgroups 3.11 disk set to
your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. For example, if your hard disk is drive C and
your Windows directory is called WINDOWS, type the following command:

   c:\windows\expand a:\ifsmgr.38_ c:\windows\system\ifsmgr.386

NOTE: The file IFSMGR.38_ is located on Disk 4 of the 3.5-inch disk set and Disk
5 of the 5.25-inch disk set.

For more information about using the EXPAND command, type "EXPAND /?" (without
the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command prompt.
