======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the playlist in either PowerPoint or PowerPoint Viewer, you
get one of the following error messages:

   1 3/4.PPT
   Sorry, the file cannot be found

   -or-

   1 3/4.PPT
   Sorry, the filename is invalid

CAUSE
=====

Your playlist is not in text file format. If you created the playlist in
Microsoft Write and saved the file in any format other than Text, your playlist
file will contain unwanted formatting data. PowerPoint and PowerPoint Viewer can
only read a pure text file that has no additional formatting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To successfully create a playlist file in Microsoft Write, save the file using
the following steps:

1. From the File menu, choose Save As.

2. From the Save File As Type list, select Text Files (*.TXT).

3. Give the file a name with eight or fewer characters, and change the .TXT
   extension to .LST.

4. Choose OK to save the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft PowerPoint and the PowerPoint Viewer use playlists to show several
consecutive presentation files. A playlist is a text file that contains the name
of each presentation to be played on a separate line.
