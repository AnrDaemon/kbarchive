SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open the Printers folder, you receive the following error
message:

   Not enough storage to complete this operation.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you are using a LaserMaster printer driver and you try to
open the Printers folder from the Settings menu, Control Panel, My Computer, or
Windows Explorer. The LaserMaster LX8 600 dots per inch (DPI) LaserJet add-on
controller card does not work with Windows 95. Windows 95 does not allow
installation of this LaserMaster printer driver.

LaserMaster has confirmed that it will not provide updated drivers for the LX8
LaserJet add-on controller card.

RESOLUTION
==========

At this time, the only work around is to remove LaserMaster printer drivers.

MORE INFORMATION

This card is no longer manufactured and is not supported under Windows 95. The
LaserMaster LX8 600 DPI LaserJet add-on controller card is manufactured by
LaserMaster, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
