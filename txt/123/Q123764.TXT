TITLE   :Display Unreadable with an IBM 8514/A Video Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you select the 8514/A Compatible Graphics Adapter driver for use with an
IBM 8514/A video adapter on an IBM computer, the display appears blurry and
unreadable. A resolution of 1024x768 and 256 colors is the only option for this
driver.

CAUSE
=====

The video adapter driver (8514a.sys) was not tested using the IBM 8514/A video
adapter. The adapters that were tested with the driver are ATI and Western
Digital Paradise video adapter (which are 8514/A compatible).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
