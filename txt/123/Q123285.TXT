The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The IPCONFIG utility displays invalid results for Microsoft Network Client for
MS-DOS version 3.0 and Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS version 2.2c.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you configure your computer as a DHCP client and then
later modify the IP configuration to be a non-DHCP client. If you execute the
IPCONFIG utility, the results displayed will reflect the old DHCP configuration
values and not the current statically assigned IP addresses.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the PROTOCOL.INI file to determine the current
statically assigned IP addresses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Network Client for
MS-DOS version 3.0 and Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS version 2.2c. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
