TITLE   :Err Msg: Unknown Firmware Error with Archive 5580 Tape Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT Backup program (NTBACKUP.EXE) in Windows NT with an
Archive 5580 tape unit, the following message may appear when you attempt to
initialize and format a tape and the attempt may fail:

   Unknown firmware error.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Archive 5580 tape unit you are using has a serial
number that starts with the letters AAA or BBB. These two tape unit models are
not compatible with Windows NT, even though the Archive 5580 tape unit is listed
in the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). Only the model with a
serial number that starts with the letters CCC works with the Windows NT Backup
program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the latest firmware from your tape unit vendor that starts with the
letters CCC (for example, serial number CCC60612). For more information, call
Archive Corporation at (714) 641-0279.


The Archive 5580 tape units are manufactured by Archive Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
