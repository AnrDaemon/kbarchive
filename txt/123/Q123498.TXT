TITLE   :NumLock Key State Not Saved When Logging Off
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.00 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log off by choosing Logoff in the File menu of Program Manager, the
NumLock key state is not saved. By default the NumLock key state is off when you
log on.

NOTE: This also causes the state of the AutoAdminLogon switch to not be saved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The numlock state is not saved if the user is not a member of the administrators
group. If the user is a member of the administrators group the numlock state is
saved on logoff.

For more information about changing the NUMLOCK properties after login, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q102978
   TITLE:REG: User Preferences Entries, PART 3

The Keyboard entry contains user preferences as defined by choosing the Keyboard
icon in Control Panel. Entries are found under this Registry path:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Keyboard

   InitialKeyboardIndicators: REG_SZ: NUMBER

   Default: 0

This specifies initial values for keys. 0 means that NUMLOCK is turned off after
the user logs on; 2 means NUMLOCK is turned on after user logs on. This value is
set during log off or shutdown to preserve the state of the NUMLOCK key at that
time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, press CTRL+ALT+DEL and choose Logoff to log off. This
procedure permanently saves the NumLock key state when you log off.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
