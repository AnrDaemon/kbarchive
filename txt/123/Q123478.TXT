SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a Windows NT Server with two PCIMAC adapters for Remote
Access Service (RAS) dial-in, clients accessing both adapters when dialing the
number will report that one of the cards doesn't respond, while one adapter
does.

CAUSE
=====

The driver setup was not configurable during Windows NT setup using the Network
Control Panel for multiple adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

DIGIINSTL.DLL and PCIMAC.SYS have been updated to address configuration of
multiple adapters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
