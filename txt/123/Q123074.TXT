The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Human Body for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Magic School Bus Explores The Human Body uses MIDI sound, which requires that
the MIDI Mapper be correctly configured. Sometimes, the MIDI Mapper icon does
not appear in the Control Panel group, and it is not started when you run MIDI
Mapper in the Bus Stop utility for Explores The Human Body.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the sound drivers for the sound card are not installed,
or are incorrectly installed.

The MIDI Mapper icon will also not be present in Control Panel if the [Don't
Load] section of the CONTROL.INI file has the Midi Mapper=1 entry. If Midi
Mapper=1 is in the [Don't Load] section of CONTROL.INI, change the =1 to =2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MIDI Mapper Control Panel is present in the Control Panel group only if a
sound board and the correct sound drivers have been installed. It is not a .CPL
file installed by Windows; it is a Control Panel installed by the sound drivers
upon installation.

Contact the manufacturer of your sound card for more information regarding the
specific drivers for your sound card, and the correct installation of the sound
card software.
