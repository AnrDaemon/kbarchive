SUMMARY
=======

You can select a group from the global address list (GAL) or network address
list and view the details of that group. The details contain friendly names for
all the members of that group, unless the group is from an externally defined
postoffice--then it only displays the alias, name, address type, mailbox,
postoffice, and network the group is located on.

This is by design; externally defined postoffice addresses, including groups, are
known only by their network/postoffice/mailbox names. No other group information
is transferred during the directory exchange process.

To determine the members (friendly names) of an externally defined group, have
the administrator for that postoffice print or create a text file containing
groups and members. (From the Mail Administrator program on that postoffice,
select Local-Admin, Group, Print, and then Printer or File.)

For more information on using the Address Book and groups, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
