TITLE   :DHCP Server Excludes Address Clusters Within a Valid Scope
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a scope is defined so that it includes a valid set of addresses in a range,
but it excludes or reserves addresses within the last 32 specific addresses of
that scope, address clusters within the legal range of the scope may not be
available to the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server for
assignment.

For example, a scope with the following settings

   Range Start: 161.240.8.1
   Range End: 161.240.15.254
   Subnet Mask: 255.255.248.0

   Excluded Addresses:

      161.240.15.126 -- 161.240.15.150
      161.240.15.181 -- 161.240.15.184
      161.240.15.187 -- 161.240.15.254

   Reserved Addresses:

      161.240.15.185, 186

results in the following pattern of DHCP server IP address assignments:

   161.240.9.0
   161.240.9.224 -- 161.240.9.255

   161.240.10.0
   161.240.10.224 -- 161.240.10.255

   161.240.11.0
   161.240.11.224 -- 161.240.11.255

   161.240.12.0
   161.240.12.224 -- 161.240.12.255

In this example, addresses within the range of 161.240.XX.0 to 161.240.XX.224
cannot be assigned by the DHCP server even though they are valid addresses
within the defined scope.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server version 3.5.
This problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
