PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,Japanese
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.1, Japanese 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application error in USER.EXE occurs under the following conditions:

 - An MDI application was created in MFC by using the Japanese version of Visual
   C++ version 1.0 or the U.S. version of Visual C++ version 1.5.

 - The frame of the child window is derived from CMDIChildWnd, and the view is
   derived from CView.

 - The user opens the first child window, then hides the frame of the child
   window. Then the user opens three more new child windows, and closes two of
   them.

This only happens under Japanese Windows 3.1, not under U.S. Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft Japan has confirmed this to be a problem in Japanese Windows version
3.1.

This problem does not exist in Windows 95 Japanese version, nor in Japanese
Windows NT.
