-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log off or shutdown a Windows NT computer while 16-bit Windows- based
networking applications are running, a dialog box with the application's name in
the title bar appears stating that the Windows application cannot respond to the
End Task request. The dialog presents three choices: Wait, End Task, and Cancel.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the application time-out due to heavy network traffic.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can configure Windows NT so that it closes the application by default,
instead of displaying the dialog box. To do so:

1. Install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5.

2. Add one of the following keys to the registry under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER
   subtree:

   \CONTROL PANEL\DESKTOP\HUNGAPPTIMEOUT

   After an application times-out, any you choose the Task List End Task button,
   the dialog box is displayed.

   \CONTROL PANEL\DESKTOP\WAITTOKILLAPPTIMEOUT

   After a log off or shutdown command is issued, and an application times-out,
   the dialog is displayed.

   \CONTROL PANEL\DESKTOP\AUTOENDTASKS

   Any non-zero value causes End Task to automatically be selected; the dialog
   box is not displayed.

STATUS
======
