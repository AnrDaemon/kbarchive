SUMMARY
=======

KEYBOARD.DRV in Eastern European versions of Windows version 3.1 has additional
virtual keys. The ToAscii() function is modified in these versions of Windows to
support the dual mode keyboard driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here's the syntax for ToAxcii():

      ToAscii(UINT uVirtKey, UINT uScanCode, BYTE FAR* lpbKeyState,
         DWORD FAR* lpdwTransKey, UINT fuState)

In Eastern European versions of Windows version 3.1, uVirtKey has a few
additional values specifically intended for these Windows.

   VK_GETSTATUS    0x8A
   VK_SET_PRI      0x88
   VK_SET_SEC      0x89

By using these Eastern European specific virtual keycodes, the application can
check the current keyboard status, or set the keyboard mode.

To Check keyboard status, use this code:

      uiStatus = ToAscii(VK_GETSTATUS,....);
      if(uiStatus == VK_SET_PRI)
         MessageBox(hWnd, "Primary Mode"...);
      else if(uiStatus == VK_SET_SEC)
         MessageBox(hWnd, "Secondary Mode"...);
      else
         MessageBox(hWnd, "You use non-EE KEYBOARD.DRV"...);

To set Primary mode, use this code:

      ToAscii(VK_SET_PRI,...);

To set Secondary mode, use this code:

      ToAscii(VK_SET_SEC,...);
