-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Windows NT 3.5 on an DEC Alpha 2100 computer, a STOP message
(0x0000008B) appears and states that the system might be infected with a virus.

CAUSE
=====

The message about the virus is misleading. The STOP message appears if more than
one hard drive is present, and the drives have not been partitioned or
formatted.

RESOLUTION
==========

In addition to setting up the partitions and formatting the first drive, either
format the additional drives with ARCINST or remove them until after Windows NT
installs.
