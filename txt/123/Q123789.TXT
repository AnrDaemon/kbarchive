The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot restrict a user from changing his or her account password if the
account was created by someone with Account Operator rights. When you select
User Cannot Change Password in User Manager, the option does not stay selected.
Accounts created by anyone else with account creation rights (Administrators for
example) do not exhibit this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and 3.5.
A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression- tested and
may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
