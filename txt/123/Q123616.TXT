KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase kbPGC smsdatabase smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Systems Management Server client's SMS-created program group contains a blank
icon with the title APPSTART instead of the proper icon for that application.
Choosing the icon results in the associated program running normally.

CAUSE
=====

The program item created in SMS Administrator has a name that exceeds 40
characters. While SMS Administrator allows names up to 64 characters,
Applications Manager cannot handle names greater than 40 characters.

Applications Manager will log the following information during its watchdog cycle
when this problem happens.

NOTE: Error 10 translates to NADERR_INVALIDDATASIZE.

Additionally, the SMS clients PGC will log errors in its SMSLOG.TXT file:
