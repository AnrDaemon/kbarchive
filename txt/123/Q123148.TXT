The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Sometimes traditional Chinese Windows version 3.1 will say a Chinese filename is
invalid even though there is no obvious reason for it. Or sometimes the Chinese
file names are changed slightly when saved.

CAUSE
=====

The reason is that CWIN31 used the original MS-DOS file system as its file
system because Microsoft never released a Chinese MS-DOS in Taiwan. Therefore,
all of the localized Chinese DOS systems are third-party products. Microsoft
only delivered device drivers (such as printer/display drivers) to interpret the
Chinese character. As a result, the file name system is still a SBCS (single
byte character set) system. The Lead byte of an MS-DOS file name has never been
checked using DBCSLeadByte filtering. CWIN31 will display or treat a DBCS
(double byte character set) filename as an erroneous file name when you try to
dump or search the DBCS file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
