TITLE   :SMS Site Configuration Manager Fails to Add Domain/Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbSCMan smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager fails to correctly add
a domain to the site when the domain contains a server name that exceeds 13
characters.

CAUSE
=====

When the NetServerEnum2 call is made to list the servers in the domain, the
correct list is returned by the primary domain controller (PDC). Because the API
returns error 2140 "An internal error has occurred," SMS Site Config Manager
ignores the domain.

When a server is added using the Use Specified Servers option, and the server
name exceeds 13 characters, the API (application program interface) function
return error 2453. Again, Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager
ignores the domain.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use server names with 13 characters or fewer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
