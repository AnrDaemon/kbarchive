TITLE   :BUG: MSVC20 Setup Fails to Install Books Online Only
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.0 setup program fails to install Books Online
if you use the setup program to try to install only Books Online. The setup
program displays the following message box:

   No options were selected. Please select the portions of Visual C++ 2.0 you
   wish to install, or choose Exit to quit Setup.

CAUSE
=====

The setup program automatically clears the check mark from the Books Online
option when it is the only option selected during the setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to work around this problem:

 - During the installation, in addition to installing Books Online, choose to
   install one of the help files as well. Then delete the quick reference help
   file after installation. To do this, select "Custom Installation," and clear
   the check marks from everything except "Help Files." Then choose "Help File
   Options" and clear the check mark from all help files except one. Then choose
   one of the "Books Online Options."

-or-

 - Copy the following files from your Visual C++ CD-ROM. These files are located
   on your CD-ROM under directory MSVC20\HELP:

   vc20bks.hdx        vc20bks.ind         vc20bks1.hlp
   vc20bks2.hlp       vc20bks3.hlp        vc20bks4.hlp
   vc20bks5.hlp       vc20bks6.hlp        vc20bks7.hlp

After finishing either of these workarounds, modify your system's registry by
using REGEDT32.EXE. To modify the keys used for Books Online under Windows NT,
modify the following string to point to the drive where you have installed Books
Online:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\ 
      Software\ 
      Microsoft\ 
      Visual C++ 2.0\ 
      Help\ 
      RemoteHelp1
