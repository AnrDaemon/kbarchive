======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After exiting the INTERSVR program, the disk space reported may be incorrect if
another computer using INTERLNK added or deleted files from the disk drive of
the server machine.

CAUSE
=====

MS-DOS avoids recalculating the free disk space by subtracting allocations and
adding deallocations from a value calculated and stored when the disk is first
accessed. The copy of MS-DOS running on the server machine is not able to detect
when individual allocations and deallocations are made by the INTERLNK client
machine; therefore, the value remains as it was when the INTERSVR program was
started.

STATUS
======

This is expected behavior when the INTERSVR program is used. The correct amount
of space available on the disk is not affected by this number, and the correct
value is reported after the system is rebooted.
