TITLE   :Err Msg: Setup Error 110 During Installation of Microsoft DLC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetserv

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running only the Enhanced Mode NDIS driver [NDIS3] on your network
interface card, you may have problems loading a real mode protocol such as
Microsoft DLC. At first, a "Setup Error: 320:" message appears warning you that
you have selected a real-mode protocol, but your network card is set up to run
only protected mode protocols.

NOTE: This message also appears when you attempt to install TCP/IP 16-bit
protocol.

If you modify the Network Interface Card driver to include a real mode NDIS2
driver, and load the real mode protocol, the following error message appears:

   Network Setup, Setup Error 110: Could not find or open the WIN.INI file.
   The file may be missing or read-only. The changed settings will not take
   effect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do one of the following:

 - Before you add the real mode protocol, change the Network Interface Card,
   NIC, driver to Real Mode and Enhanced Mode NDIS Driver [NDIS2/NDIS3]. Reboot
   the system, then return to Network Setup to add the real mode protocol.

-or-

 - Update your installation of Windows for Workgroups with the files from the
   Windows NT Server version 3.5 CD-ROM under CLIENTS\WFW\UPDATE. This will
   allow a simultaneous update of the NIC NDIS driver and the addition of a real
   mode protocol.
