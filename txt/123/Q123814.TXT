-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If Windows NT detects a problem with the Master Boot Record (MBR), the following
message appears:

   MBR checksum error: a virus may be present. Verify Master Boot Record
   integrity.


MORE INFORMATION
================

MBR problems are frequently caused by boot sector viruses. Microsoft has
confirmed that versions of the Stoned and Josh viruses can cause the MBR
checksum error message.

This problem most often occurs when you have set up Windows NT using WINNT.EXE.
The floppy disks for a CD-ROM installation can become infected when you run DIR
from an infected MS-DOS computer.

If the MBR checksum error message occurs during setup, Windows NT Setup does not
continue. If this happens, run an anti-virus program to remove the virus.
