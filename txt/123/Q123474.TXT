operating system and SourceSafe combinations are used:

   Network Operating System      SourceSafe Version(s)
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   Windows NT 3.1 or greater     SourceSafe 2.X or greater,
                                 Windows NT or 32-bit
                                 version.

   Novell Netware                SourceSafe 2.02 to 3.02

   Macintosh                     SourceSafe 2.X for Macintosh

However, occasionally, you may need to override this setting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Use the environment variables SSUSER and SSPWD to set the desired User Name
   and Password.

2. Use the -y parameter on the command line, as in this example:

         SS GET <$/FileName> -yJANET,MYPWD

3. Set the SourceSafe variable Use_Network to No to force SourceSafe to prompt
   for the username and password.

In Visual SourceSafe, you can force prompting for the User Name by going to the
Visual SourceSafe Admin program and deselecting the "Use network name for
automatic user logon" check box in the Options dialog box under the Tools menu.
If you want this to occur for only one user, set the ini variable in the users
SS.INI file.
