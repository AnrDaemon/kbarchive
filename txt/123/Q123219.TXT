SYMPTOMS
========

The commands "ARP -s" and "ARP -d" do not work on a Windows NT Server version
3.5 if the Remote Access Service (RAS) is installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must remove RAS from the Networks option in the
Control Panel and restart Windows NT Server. Just stopping RAS results in the
same problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are

Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
