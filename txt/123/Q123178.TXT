The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Wall Data Rumba Office version 1.0 3270 emulator on an SNA
Server Windows version 3.x client computer, the SNA Server Administration
program may display the user name as "Unknown."

If you start the SNA Server Windows version 3.x client ahead of time (by starting
WNAP.EXE manually, or by adding WNAP.EXE icon to the Windows Startup group), the
user name appears correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Due to an initialization problem, the Rumba 3270 emulator was not properly
initializing the underlying SNA Server client software before opening a 3270
session, causing the user name to appear as "Unknown" in the SNA Server
Administration program.

==========
