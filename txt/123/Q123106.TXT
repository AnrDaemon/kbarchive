TITLE   :SMS Inventory Disables Speaker on Client Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Systems Management Server Inventory Agent on a client
computer, the speaker on the client computer stops working.

For example, you can load the speaker by adding the following line to the
[drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      Wave = speaker.drv

After the SMS client runs the inventory, you lose the speaker; that is, if you
test the CHIMES.WAV file from the Control Panel Sound applet, there is no sound,
regardless of the volume setting.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you use the SPEAKER.DRV file that was written for the
MCI sound driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart (reboot) the client computer but do not run the inventory (SMSLS.BAT);
the speaker will return to normal.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
