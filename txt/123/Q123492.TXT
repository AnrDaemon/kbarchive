TITLE   :FIX: Link /SECTION Option Does Not Check for Name Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC400fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Linker (LINK.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The /SECTION option for the linker does not check:

 - The name specified to determine the existence of that section.

 - The case of the name even though the documentation for the /SECTION option
   states that the name is case sensitive.

 - The attributes following the section name for errors.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 4.0.

REFERENCES
==========

The following information is taken from Visual C++ version 2.0 Books Online,
Appendix B regarding the /SECTION linker option:

      /SECTION:name,attributes

   This option changes the attributes of a section, overriding the attributes
   set when the object file for the section was compiled.

   Specify a colon (:) and a section name. The name is case sensitive.

   Specify one or more attributes for the section. The attribute characters are
   E, R, W, and S and are not case sensitive. You must specify all attributes
   that you want the section to have; an omitted attribute character causes that
   attribute bit to be turned off. Attribute characters have the following
   meanings:

   Character       Attribute       Meaning
   E               execute         Allows code to be executed
   R               read            Allows read operations on data
   W               write           Allows write operations on data
   S               shared          Shares the section among all

   processes that load the image

A section that does not have E, R, or W set is probably invalid.

NOTE: Under Win32s, the DLL data sections are loaded as "shared" even if that
attribute is not set, because Windows has this requirement.
