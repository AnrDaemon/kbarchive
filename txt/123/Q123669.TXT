TITLE   :Err Msg: Cannot Load Extension FTPSMX.DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Server Manager, SRVMGR.EXE, is a utility found in the Windows NT 3.5 Server and
Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit CD-ROMs that allows you to manage computers and
domains from your Windows NT Workstation client computer. When you run Server
Manager on your Windows NT Workstation that is running the FTP Server service,
one or both of the following error messages appear:

   The procedure entry point I_FtpDisconnectUser could not be located in the
   dynamic link library FTPSVC.DLL.

   -OR-

   Cannot load extension FTPSMX.DLL
   Error 0126: The specified module cannot be found

CAUSE
=====

If the FTP Server service is running on the computer, Server Manager looks for
the files, FTPSMX.DLL and FTPSVC.DLL to load. However these files are not
included in Windows NT Workstation or in the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit. They
are available only on the Windows NT Server CD-ROM and in the download file,
FTPSMX.EXE, mentioned below.

The file, FTPSMX.DLL, is the FTP Server management extensions for Server Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

Expand the files FTPSVC.DLL, FTPSMX.DLL, and FTPSMX.HLP from the Windows NT 3.5
Server CD-ROM to the %systemroot%\SYSTEM32 directory on your Windows NT 3.5
Workstation computer.

If you do not have the Windows NT Server CD-ROM, you can find FTPSMX.EXE, a
self-extracting file, on the following services:

 - Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet
   On the www.microsoft.com home page, click the Support icon.
   Click Knowledge Base, and select the product.
   Enter kbfile FTPSMX.EXE, and click GO!
   Open the article, and click the button to download the file.

 - Internet (anonymous FTP)
   ftp ftp.microsoft.com
   Change to the Softlib/Mslfiles folder.
   Get FTPSMX.EXE
