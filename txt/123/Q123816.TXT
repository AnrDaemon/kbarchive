When you start Windows NT version 3.5 or 3.51 with a 3Com EtherLink III
(3C509)network adapter, the network adapter driver (ELNK3.SYS) may fail to
recognize the network adapter and then display the following error message:

   At least one service or driver failed during system startup.

The following is logged in the Event Viewer:

   Description: The I/O address supplied does not match the jumpers on the
   adapter.

the network adapter driver with the device. If the problem persists, use another
network adapter.
