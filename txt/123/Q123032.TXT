TITLE   :BUG: SKIP Produces Unexpected Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.60
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.60 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the SKIP clause on a BAR of a POPUP, FoxPro for Windows disables
the menu choice but still displays the disabled choice and allows the disabled
choice to be selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use an IF _WINDOWS clause to bracket the code. Then define the POPUP and BARs
without the SKIP option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SKIP clause does not work in FoxPro for Windows but does work as documented
in FoxPro for MS-DOS. For example, the following code works correctly in FoxPro
for MS-DOS but not in FoxPro for Windows:

     DEFINE POPUP CAmenu FROM 5,23 TO 23,53
     DEFINE BAR 1 OF CAmenu PROMPT "          Main Menu"   SKIP
     DEFINE BAR 2 OF CAmenu PROMPT "-----------------------------"   SKIP
     DEFINE BAR 3 OF CAmenu PROMPT "  Application, Inquiry, HSQ"
     ACTIVATE POPUP CAmenu

Code to Reproduce Problem
-------------------------

Run the following code in FoxPro for Windows:

     DEFINE POPUP CAmenu FROM 5,23 TO 23,53
     DEFINE BAR 1 OF CAmenu PROMPT "          Main Menu"   SKIP
     DEFINE BAR 2 OF CAmenu PROMPT "-----------------------------"   SKIP
     DEFINE BAR 3 OF CAmenu PROMPT "  Application, Inquiry, HSQ"
     ACTIVATE POPUP Camenu
    
     ON SELECTION BAR 1 WAIT WINDOW 'Bar 1'
     ON SELECTION BAR 2 WAIT WINDOW 'Bar 2'
     ON SELECTION BAR 3 WAIT WINDOW 'Bar 3'

Even though you can select Bars 1 and 2 by using the cursor keys, no WAIT WINDOW
appears for them.
