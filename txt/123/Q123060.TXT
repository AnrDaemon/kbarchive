SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes you may need to send a document in Microsoft Mail for Windows that
recipients cannot edit or where control of its contents must be maintained by
the document's owner. To do this, create a pointer in Windows Object Packager
that sets up a universal naming convention (UNC) connection to the original
document, which is stored on a read-only network share:

1. Create a read-only share on a server and save your document in this share.

2. In the Windows Accessories group, open Object Packager. From the Edit menu,
   choose Command Line.

3. In the Command Line box, enter a UNC path and filename (in the form
   \\<server_name>\<share_name>) of the document you want to send.

4. Choose the Insert Icon button to create an icon for your document.

5. To copy the package to the clipboard, choose Copy Package from the Edit menu.

6. Start Microsoft Mail for Windows and create a new mail message. Choose Paste
   from the Edit menu to paste your pointer into Mail.

When you send your message, the recipient will be able to view the document but
not edit it, thereby protecting its contents.
