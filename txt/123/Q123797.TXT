PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:4.0; WINDOWS:4.0,7.0; :1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kborg

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Organization Chart, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot change the shadow color in Microsoft Organization Chart from within
the Organization Chart program.

CAUSE
=====

Organization Chart 2.0 uses it's own shadow color of black, and does not follow
the PowerPoint Slide Color Scheme. This shadow color cannot be modified in
Organization Chart 2.0, nor can it be modified by changing the Slide Color
Scheme in PowerPoint.

Organization Chart 1.0 follows the Slide Color Scheme from PowerPoint. You must
update and return to PowerPoint and then change it from the presentation's color
scheme.

WORKAROUND
==========

PowerPoint 7.0
--------------

To change the shadow color of the Organization Chart, you must ungroup the
Organization Chart object, select each shadow box object, and change the color
by clicking Colors And Lines on the Format menu.

NOTE: Once the Organization Chart has been ungrouped, it becomes a series of
PowerPoint shapes, and can no longer be modified or changed in the Organization
Chart application.

PowerPoint 4.0
--------------

To change the color of Organization Chart shadows, follow these steps:

1. In PowerPoint, click Slide Color Scheme on the Format menu.

2. Double-click the box marked Shadows.

3. Select the color you want from the palette.

4. Click Apply to make the change on the current slide, or click Apply To All to
   change the color for all slides in the presentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PowerPoint 4.0 automatically recolors the shadow to match the color scheme of
the current presentation. As long as PowerPoint is recoloring the shadow of the
Organization Chart object, the shadow will automatically change if the user ever
modifies the presentation's color scheme.
