TITLE   :RAS Error 652 with US-Robotics 14400 Sportster
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure the Windows for Workgroups Remote Access Service (RAS)
client with a US-Robotics 14400 Sportster modem, or some Gateway Telepath and
internal modems, for call-back from a RAS server, the modem fails to
reinitialize in call-back mode and the following error message appears:

   Error 652: Unrecognized text response received from the device.
   Make sure the device you selected in Setup matches your modem.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the RAS client software in Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 does not keep the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal state low long
enough for the modem to release the line. In this case, DTR was in the low state
for approximately 1 millisecond. The US-Robotics 14400 Sportster modem requires
the DTR to be in the low state for at least 5 milliseconds.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

The US-Robotics 14400 Sportster modem is manufactured by US-Robotics, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
