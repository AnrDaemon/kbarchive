SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server supports SNA connections over X.25/QLLC using any SDLC adapter
supported by SNA Server, or through special X.25 link services available from
several third-party vendors listed in the SNA Server product companion catalog
included with the product.

For SNA Server configuration information, see the SNA Server Admin program's
Online Help, the SNA Server "Administrator's Guide," and/or the appropriate
third-party vendor's documentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the connection still fails to activate after you follow the configuration
information and you're connecting to a host system, the following settings
should also be checked in the SNA Server 2.11 Admin Advanced Setup dialog box
for the SNA Server X.25 connection. For SNA Server 3.0 and 4.0 these settings
can be accessed in X.25 connection properties in SNA Manager.

 - XID Format

   For 3270 communication to a host system over X.25/QLLC, some host systems
   require Format 0.

 - User Data

   Host systems require that C3 is configured here to indicate that X.25/QLLC
   protocol is being requested.
