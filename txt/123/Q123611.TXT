SUMMARY
=======

When you install Windows 95, the file SCSIPORT.PDR is installed even if you do
not have a SCSI controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This file is installed in the Windows \SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS directory on all
computers, even those without SCSI controllers. Many original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs) do not specify through their .INF files to install
SCSIPORT.PDR when you add their SCSI devices; therefore, Windows 95 installs it
during Setup.

Microsoft recommends that you leave SCSIPORT.PDR on your hard disk in case you
add a SCSI device at a later time. Its small size does not consume much space.
