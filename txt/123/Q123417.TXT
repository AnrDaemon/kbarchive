If you attempt to log on anonymously, the following error message appears:

   530 User <user name> cannot log in.

You cannot configure FTP Server for anonymous logins if you use an account
name from a trusted domain. It must be an account in either the local or
domain security database of the host computer.

If the ftp server is a member server of a domain, the user ID must be an
account local to the machine.  Domain accounts cannot be used.  It is
necessary to create a local account for the user on the domain member
server.
