TITLE   :Error 84: There Are Too Many Network Redirections...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER::3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the real-mode network with the basic redirector by running the
NET USE, NET START BASIC, or NET START WORKSTATION command, you receive one of
the following error messages:

 - Error 84: There are too many network redirections.

   -or-

 - Cannot reconnect <x>: to \\<server>\<share> (Error 84)
   where <x> is the network drive letter.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the real-mode basic redirector that is packaged with
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS is limited to a
maximum of ten connections (sessions) to network resources (printers and drive
connections).

The above errors can occur if you make more than ten connections in Workgroup
Add-On for MS-DOS or Windows for Workgroups and you then quit Windows or
Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS and start the real-mode redirector with the NET
START BASIC command.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, load the full redirector with the NET START FULL
command.

NOTE: Increasing the value of the SESSIONS= line in the PROTOCOL.INI file has no
effect on the number of sessions that can be established with the basic
redirector. The SESSIONS= entry is valid for the full redirector only.
