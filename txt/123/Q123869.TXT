TITLE   :BUG: Trouble Changing Where SETUP Installs MASM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMASM611 kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During installation of MASM version 6.11, you are given the option of changing
where the setup program will install MASM. However, if you choose to do so, it
does not work the way you'd expect.

For example, the default directory for executable files is shown in an edit field
as:

   C:\MASM611\BIN

If you move the cursor to the B and press the Insert key to change to overstrike
mode, the cursor does not change in appearance, and it incorrectly advances one
space to the I. If you move the cursor back one space to the B and type EXE, the
directory is updated correctly to C:\MASM611\EXE. However, if you didn't notice
that the cursor has advanced and left it on the I, the result would be
C:\MASM611\BEXEBIN.


RESOLUTION
==========

Once the correct directory name is entered in the edit field, the installation
proceeds as expected.

STATUS
======

here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
