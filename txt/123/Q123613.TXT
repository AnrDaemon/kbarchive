TITLE   :FAX: Faxes Print on Every Other Page with Size A4 Paper
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An extra sheet of paper is ejected between each page printed when DISPLAY.EXE is
configured to automatically spool faxes to a printer using European paper size
(A4).

CAUSE
=====

The PPB driver that is used to read the printer configuration from the
DISPLAY.EXE does not correctly read an A4 paper size. Therefore, if the actual
size of the A4 paper is 247 cm by 246 cm, the extra pages will be printed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Because the PPB driver is not used by FAXVIEW.EXE, it is possible to turn off
the automatic spool and let users print their faxes from their own desktop using
FAXVIEW.EXE. This will allow the faxes to print on a single page.
