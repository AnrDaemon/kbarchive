TITLE   :Olicom NIC Driver Does Not Install Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation of the Olicom 16/4 network interface card (NIC), not all
the files are copied over and the following error message appears::

   Setup is unable to obtain network adapter information from the associated DLL
   files. Operation cannot continue.

If you choose to continue it appears as though the installation completes, but
the NIC never binds and the network services do not start. The error message
reappears if you attempt to view the configuration of the NIC driver.

CAUSE
=====

The Olicom 16/4 NIC requires a driver located in the DRVLIB subdirectory of the
Windows NT CD. The full path is DRVLIB\NETCARD\X86\OCTK16. The OLINCDET.DLL file
is not copied over during installation. Without this file the adapter
information cannot be detected.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Copy the following files into the SYSTEM32 directory:

      OTCK16.DLL
      OTCK16.SYS
      OTCK16.HLP
      OEMSETUP.INF
      OLINCDET.DLL
      OCTKSTAT.EXE

   NOTE: A copy error will occur on the files, as the source and destination are
   the same, just ignore these errors.

2. Specify SYSTEM32 as the location of the OEMSETUP.INF file.

The NIC will now install and properly bind.
