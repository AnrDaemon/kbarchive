SUMMARY
=======

To move the SourceSafe data directory to a location different from the
SourceSafe location, follow these steps:

1. Copy the DATA directory to the new directory.

   IMPORTANT: Make sure you copy all subdirectories even if they are empty.
   SourceSafe will not work correctly if they are not present. SourceSafe users
   must have FULL rights in the target directory.

   To reduce confusion, you may want to delete the old directory once you have
   successfully copied the DATA directory to its new location.

2. Edit the SRCSAFE.INI file using any text editor. Change this line:

         Data_Path = data

   to this line:

         Data_Path = <new path>\data_dir

   NOTE: This variable must be defined in the SRCSAFE.INI for version 3.x or
   later and in the SYSTEM.INI for version 2.x.
