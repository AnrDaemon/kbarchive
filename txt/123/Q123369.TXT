SUMMARY
=======

Due to the way the Windows NT Computer Browser service manages LAN Manager/LAN
Server domains in its browse list, the Site Configuration Manager may fail to
enumerate a LAN Manager/LAN Server-only domain when adding a LAN Manager/LAN
Server domain to a Systems Management Server site. It is possible to correct
this by modifying the configuration of the Computer Browser service on the site
server domain primary domain controller (PDC).

On the site server domain PDC, the Computer Browser service must be specifically
configured to include the LAN Manager/LAN Server domain. To do this, use the
following procedure:

1. In Control Panel, choose the Network icon.

2. In the Network Settings dialog box, select Computer Browser and choose
   Configure.

3. For Other Domain, type the name of the LAN Manager/LAN Server domain and

choose Add. Choose OK.

This procedure will cause the Computer Browser service for the domain to track
needed information on the LAN Manager/LAN Server domain, allowing SMS to
successfully configure the new domain. This is not specific to SMS and may also
be needed for simple domain and server browsing from within File Manager on a
network with both Windows NT domains and pure LAN Manager/LAN Server domains.
