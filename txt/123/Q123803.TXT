   /* Compile options needed: none
   */ 
   #include <iostream.h>
   template <class T> class genvec3d { };
   template <class T>
   ostream& operator<< (ostream& o, const genvec3d<T>& p)
   {
      return o;
   }
   class ray
   {
      public:
                   genvec3d<float> origin;
                   ray(){}
                   friend int operator<<(ostream& o, ray& r)
   /* The following line causes compiler Error */ 
                   { o << origin; return 1; }

   /* To work around the problem, change the line above into a comment and
      change the following line to an executed line of code.  */ 
               /*  { o << r.origin; return 1; }  */
