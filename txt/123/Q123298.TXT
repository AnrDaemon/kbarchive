SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to dial out from a Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS)
client using the Remote Access protocol Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) or
Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to a TCP/IP server, you receive one of the
following error messages:

Using SLIP
----------

   Error 611: Route is not available

Using PPP
---------

   Error 720: No PPP control protocols configured.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may have several different causes. Two known causes are the NetBIOS
interface not being installed and the NetBIOS binding being disabled. The
NetBIOS interface is required for establishing logical names and sessions on the
network for Windows NT.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To correct this problem, select the Network option from Control Panel and do the
following:

1. Verify that the NetBIOS interface is installed.

2. Verify that the bindings of the NetBIOS interface are enabled and properly
   established with the NDISWAN drivers. To do so:

   a. Start Registry Editor, and locate the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\00xx

      <00xx> is the subkey that is defined in "DriverDesc" as "WAN
      Miniport(IP)".

   b. Click the LinKage subkey.

   c. In the detail pane, you should have a "RootDevice" of "NdisWanIp". In
      addition, there will be an "UpperBind" key, which needs to have a value of
      Tcpip.
