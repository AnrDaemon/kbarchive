TITLE   :SETLS32 Fails To Remap Windows NT Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig smshowto smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you log onto a Master User Domain (MUD) from a Windows NT workstation that is
a member of a resource domain, the workstation will report to the MUD instead of
the resource domain even though the SMSLS.INI file maps the workstations domain
and workgroup to the resource domain.

CAUSE
=====

The incorrect domain mapping results because there is no application programming
interface (API) call that can retrieve the current resource domain, only the
authenticating user domain.

A possible workaround would be to use the [workgroup] section of the SMSLS.INI
file and add the "resourcedomain=resourcedomain" line. Because this line would
match the check made by SETLS32.EXE, the workgroup "resourcedomain" should be
enumerated (even though there is no real workgroup by this name), a server
should be found, and mapping should complete. Unfortunately, the default server
is passed to the enumeration call and set to the authenticating server in the
MUD. Because of this, there is no known workaround for the problem except a
[machine]-based mapping.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.
