The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Microsoft TCP/IP protocol (from either Windows NT 3.5 or TCP/IP- 32),
you can't launch FTP from a batch file and use it interactively.

CAUSE
=====

Some implementations of Berkeley's FTP client give you the ability to launch FTP
from I/O redirection and then use FTP interactively. Microsoft's implementation
of FTP does not support this functionality.

Windows NT 3.5 and TCP/IP-32 use batch files on the command line with the - S
switch. When the script finishes, FTP exits.
