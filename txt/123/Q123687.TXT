SUMMARY
=======

To break out of a long running program, it is customary to use CTRL+C or
CTRL+BREAK. However, MS-DOS only checks for CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK when processing
keyboard input. If there is no keyboard input in a loop (it contains only
calculations), the program is likely to ignore CTRL+C and CTRL+BREAK.

The PeekcharQQ() function performs keyboard input processing and should not
significantly slow down your program, if used cautiously.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you call PeekcharQQ() in a long loop, MS-DOS checks the keyboard for input.
If CTRL+C or CTRK+BREAK was pressed, the program terminates.

In the sample code in this article, PeekcharQQ() is called thousands of times a
second. In an actual application, this would noticeably slow the program. It is
usually sufficient to place calls to PeekcharQQ() so that it is called at most a
few times a second.

NOTE: Sometimes the following simple code will break on a CTRL+C even without the
call to PeekcharQQ(). However, more complex code will require adding calls to
PeekcharQQ() to allow CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK processing.

Sample Code
-----------

   C Compile Options needed: none

         include'flib.fi'
         include'flib.fd'

         logical l

         do i=1,1000000
            x = sqrt(i)
            l = peekcharqq()
         end do
         end
