The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SETUP.TXT file included with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 incorrectly states
that Windows for Workgroups ships with TIGA drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Displays That May Require Driver Updates with Windows for Workgroups"
section of the SETUP.TXT file states the following:

   NOTE: Some DGIS-based adapters are TIGA-compatible and run well when used
   with the appropriate TIGACD.EXE MS-DOS driver and with the TIGA driver
   provided with Windows for Workgroups.

The drivers for TIGA-based graphic cards no longer ship with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11. (Texas Instruments manufactured these cards and no longer
provides support for them.) However, it may be possible to use the TIGA drivers
that shipped with Windows 3.1 or the SVGA drivers provided with Windows for
Workgroups.

Additional query words: 3.11 ti super vga graphics
