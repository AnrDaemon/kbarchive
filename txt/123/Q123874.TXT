TITLE   :PRB: Section Names Truncated to Eight Characters When Linked
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Linker (LINK.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 2.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can control the section names that the C/C++ compiler, version 9.0,
generates by using the /ND or /NT compiler options, the code_seg pragma, or the
data_seg pragma. However, the names generated by the compiler are truncated to
eight-character names during linking with LINK version 2.5.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. Section names are limited to eight characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Build the following sample code

   test.c
      ------

      #pragma code_seg( "LongCodeSectionName" )
      int i=7;

      main( )
      {
         exit(i);
      }

2. Observe the long section name contained in the object file by executing this
   command:

   link -dump -all test.obj > testobj.out

   Then search the output file for LongCodeSectionName. The full name is in the
   object file.

3. Observe that LongCodeSectionName is truncated to LongCode in the executable
   file by executing this command:

   link -dump - all test.exe > testexe.out

Additional query words: 2.50 9.00
