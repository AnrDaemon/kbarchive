   Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services


The FoxPro Migration application helps developers convert dBASE IV and Clipper
code to FoxPro compatible syntax. FoxPro 2.6 and 2.6a have built in commands
providing compatibility with dBASE IV, so Microsoft no longer directly offers
the Migration application to users. However, you can still obtain the files from
the MSL.
