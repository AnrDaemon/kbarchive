TITLE   :UNC Connection Generates Error Message on Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you establish a universal naming convention (UNC) network connection with a
Windows 95 machine and then the Windows 95 machine is shut down using the Start
menu, you receive the following error message

   There are <x> user(s) connected to your computer. Shutting down your
   computer will disconnect them. Do you want to continue?

where <x> indicates the number of users currently connected.

CAUSE
=====

A client connected to a Windows 95 server needs to maintain the connection for a
reasonable amount of time, allowing for user interaction. If the Windows 95
machine is shut down during this time, the above error message is generated. It
is generated even though there are no drives mapped directly to the Windows 95
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, wait a short time before shutting down the Windows 95
computer.
