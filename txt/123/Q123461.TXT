SYMPTOMS
========

The following program compiles, but one of the following warnings appears:

   C4090: 'initializing' : different 'const' qualifiers:

-or-

   C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'const char *' to 'char *'
                           Conversion loses qualifiers

   const char *ReturnConstantPtr()
   {
      const char *p = "can't touch this";
      return p;
   }

   void main()
   {
       char *p = ReturnConstantPtr();
   }

However, the above program will compile without exception if a type definition is
used for char* as follows:

      typedef char* CPTR;

      const CPTR ReturnConstantPtr()
      {
          const CPTR p = "can't touch this";
          return p;
      }

      void main()
      {
          CPTR p = ReturnConstantPtr();
      }

CAUSE
=====

This occurs for two reasons. First, typedefs are not macros, so modifiers like
const or volatile apply to the whole construct. When the following are used

      #typedef  char*  CPTR
      const  CPTR  cPtr;

they are equivalent to "char* const cPtr;" not "const char* cPtr;."

Second, since "char* const cPtr;" declares cPtr as a constant pointer to
character data and "const char* cPtr;" declares cPtr as a pointer to constant
character data, the two declarations are quite different.

Thus, a "different const qualifier" warning is generated for

      char *p = ReturnConstantPtr();

because it is trying to set p equal to a pointer that points to a constant
character whose value *p could try to change. Alternatively, no warning is
generated for

      CPTR p = ReturnConstantPtr();

because it is setting p equal to a constant pointer that points to a character
whose value *p may freely change.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information on the const keyword, search the online documentation
provided with Visual C++, 32-bit edition, for "const" or "constant values." For
more information on the typedef keyword, search the online documentation for
"#typedef" or "typedef specifier."
