multi-threaded environment, such as Windows 95, Windows NT, OS/2, Novell
NetWare, or Unix, one of the following problems occurs:

   -or-

 - Disk errors, such as "Cannot write to Drive C:"

CAUSE
=====

function properly in a multi-threaded environment.

RESOLUTION

It may be possible to determine the CD-ROM drive's firmware version by running
the diagnostics utilities provided with most SCSI adapters. If no diagnostics
utilities are available, contact Plextor (formerly Texel) for information about
