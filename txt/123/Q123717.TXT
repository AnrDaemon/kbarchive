TITLE   :Windows NT Backup Writes Incorrect Times To Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Backup writes incorrect times (one hour late) to its log when the
time zone is not with the United States.

CAUSE
=====

GetCurrentDate() in \PRIVATE\UTILS\NTBACKUP\SRC\DATETIME.C uses the C- Runtime
call localtime() to get the current time (instead of the Win32 API
GetLocalTime()). Localtime() calls tzset() to determine the time zone and
daylight saving settings. Tzset doesn't take the real daylight saving
information from GetTimeZoneInformation into account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
