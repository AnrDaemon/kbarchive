The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following procedures will guide you through setting up a primary site server
on a remote SQL Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing SQL Server
---------------------

1. Install SQL Server on the Windows NT domain server. Follow SQL Server
   documentation.

   NOTE: All device names and passwords are case-sensitive.

2. Start SQL Administrator to create new devices for the remote Systems
   Management Server computer.

3. Connect to the SQL Server computer using the correct login name and password.

4. Click the Devices icon.

5. On the Manage menu, click Devices.

6. Click Create.

7. Enter a logical name. SQL Server Administrator will generate a physical name
   with a .dat extension.

8. Select database for the type and use the size you think is correct for your
   site. The more computers to be inventoried, the larger the database should
   be. Use 40 KB to 50 KB per computer.

9. Click OK.

10. Repeat steps 4 through 8 for LOG device creation changing the .dat file
   extensions to .log. Do not change the device number for either the DB or the
   LOG device creation.

11. Do not create a new database. The Systems Management Server Setup program
   creates the Systems Management Server databases dynamically and attaches the
   devices.

Installing Systems Management Server
------------------------------------

1. Create a user account for the Systems Management Server Service Account. This
   account must be a member of either the Administrators local group or the
   Trusted Domains Administrators group. Ensure that this user can log on as a
   service.

   If the SQL database is located on a non-trusted domain, ensure that the user
   account you have created in your domain has the same username and password as
   the remote SQL Server.

   NOTE: If this procedure is not done properly, the following error message may
   appear:

   Hierarchy Manager is not responding to instructions.

   Also, if running the SMS setup program and the SQL database is located on a
   non-trusted domain ensure that the currently logged in user has a duplicate
   account and same password in the remote domain or you could get the following
   error dialog when attempting to change the service account, SMS account, or a
   site reset:

   Error: Cannot start SQL server
   Cannot change service account (or SQL account)

2. Install Systems Management Server.

3. When prompted about SQL Server, enter the computer name of the remote SQL
   Server computer.

4. Complete the fields on the screen until you get to the database name, device,
   and log device. Enter the device names that you chose on the remote SQL
   Server computer. Systems Management Server Setup creates the database
   dynamically in order to attach to the manually created devices.

5. Click OK and proceed with the rest of the Systems Management Server
   installation.
