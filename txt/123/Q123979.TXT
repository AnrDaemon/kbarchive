TITLE   :3C770 FDDI (FLNK.SYS) Problems Under Windows NT 3.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Several problems have been reported with the 3C770 FDDI (FLNK.SYS) driver that
ships with Windows NT version 3.5:

 - During installation, the driver does not initialize. This prevents you from
   joining a domain.

 - If you attempt to use Network Monitor or Performance Monitor to view network
   activity, it causes your system to stop responding (hang).

 - STOP messages at bootup appear on systems with Pentium Write Back Cache
   enabled.

CAUSE
=====

The FLNK.SYS driver (version 1.16) has various problems. To determine the
version number select the driver in File Manager and choose Properties from the
File menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in Windows NT version
3.51.

NOTE: The Windows NT 3.5 US Service Pack 2 help file (NT35SP2.HLP), and the
version of this article on the April 1995 TechNet CD, erroneously state that
this problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5.

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
