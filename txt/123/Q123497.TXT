-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT version 3.5 on ALR Evolution V-Q/60 and Evolution
V-Q/66 computers, the serial ports are not recognized in the Ports option in
Control Panel. Windows NT Terminal reports that all serial (COM) ports are in
use.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Windows NT version 3.5 NTDETECT.COM is not able to read
the ALR EISA configuration file for serial port information. This problem does
not occur in Windows NT version 3.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain ECU213.ZIP from ALR's bulletin board system
(BBS) at (714) 458-6834. This file includes the updated EISA configuration
utility (version 213). For additional information, contact ALR Technical Support
at (714) 581-6770 or (800) 257-1230.
