TITLE   :Large File Download Fails Over Eicon WAN Services
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Downloading a 30MB host file fails after 96,000 records when you use the
Passport Communications RJE Print Manager product (either the MS-DOS or Windows
NT versions) over SNA Server 2.0.

SNA Server is configured with an SDLC link supported by Eicon WAN Services for
Windows NT version 3 release 1. The RJE download problem coincides with the
Eicon SDLC connection being dropped.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Eicon WAN Services for Windows NT version 3 release 1a (v3r1a).

NOTE: Eicon has a separate update for Windows NT 3.5.

Additional query words: prodsna 2.00 2.10
