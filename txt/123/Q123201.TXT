TITLE   :Bookshelf Atlas Map Printed on LaserJet III/IIISi Is Dithered
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a selected map from the Microsoft Bookshelf '94 Atlas to a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet III or IIISi, the printed map appears to contain
dots or dithering. These dots do not occur when you print from Windows version
3.1.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 Universal Printer Driver dithering option is set to a value other
than None.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print a non-dithered map, set the Windows 95 dithering option for the HP
LaserJet III or IIISi to None. To change the dithering option, perform the
following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Use the right (secondary) mouse button to select the HP LaserJet III or IIISi
   printer.

3. Click Properties, then click the Graphics tab.

4. Under Dithering, click None.

5. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is caused by changes in the Windows 95 printing system. With the
Windows 3.x HP printer driver, GDI.EXE is given a non-dithered bitmap to
stretch; with the Windows 95 Universal Printer Driver, GDI.EXE is given a
dithered bitmap to stretch, which results in the dithering pattern.
