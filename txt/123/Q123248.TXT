TITLE   :PC WRmt: Err Msg: Postoffice Has Not Accepted Mail Item
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows has mail queued up and
dials into the EXTERNAL.EXE machine at the postoffice, the following error may
be displayed after a connection has been established:

   Postoffice has not accepted mail item

EXTERNAL.EXE will log the following error in the log file:

   Connection end. Disk storage full.

CAUSE
=====

This error could be caused by missing subdirectories under the MAI or ATT
directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MAI directory has 16 subdirectories, MA0 through MAF. The ATT directory has
16 subdirectories, AT0 through ATF. Missing subdirectories are often a result of
backup and restore processes that are not configured to include empty
directories or zero-length files. The POPULATE.MSM file is used to ensure the
directory is not completely empty.

If subdirectories are missing from the MAI or ATT directory, either restore them
from a backup copy. If no backup exists, create them using the MS-DOS Make
Directory (MD) command and copy POPULATE.MSM from another mail subdirectory,
then change the attribute to read only.

NOTE: If you do not restore from backup copies but you just re-create the missing
subdirectories, any mail messages or attachments in the directory prior to its
loss will no longer be available.
