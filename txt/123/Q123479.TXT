The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change your Windows NT domain password to a previously used
password, while logging into a Windows for Workgroups workstation that logs onto
a Windows NT domain, one of the following error messages appears:

   The password you specified is too short. You must use a longer Password.

-or-

   Unable to change the password for Microsoft Networking because of the
   following error: The password is shorter than required.

NOTE: This problem can also occur when you connect to a Windows NT 3.5 domain
controller from the following client computers:

 - Microsoft Windows version 3.1 with Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2b

 - Microsoft Windows 95

This problem may also occur when you connect to a Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT
4.0 domain controller from the following client computer:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT server, responding as the domain controller, indicates that the
password is not unique. The Windows for Workgroups workstation does not properly
interpret the response. This situation occurs when the new password you attempt
to use duplicates one of your previous passwords.

WORKAROUND
==========

When the error message noted above appears, use a unique password.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to change your password at a Windows NT workstation, and your new
password does not meet the User Manager Account Policy Password Uniqueness
setting, the following error message appears:

   Your password must be at least <x> characters long. Your new password
   cannot be the same as any of your previous <y> passwords. Type a
   password which meets these requirements in both text boxes.

where <x> is the minimum password length and <y> is the number of
previous password entries checked for password uniqueness.
