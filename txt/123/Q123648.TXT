TITLE   :Can't Print to HP JetDirect Printers Over DLC w/Intel Flash32
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT 3.5, if you are using an Intel Flash32 network interface card
(NIC), printing with the DLC protocol to an HP JetDirect card may not work
properly. A connection can be made to the printer, but print jobs sent will be
spooled and deleted, never printing.

This problem is related to the driver for the Flash32 NIC, written by Intel.
Currently, the only workaround is to use a different NIC for printing with DLC.

For additional information, contact Intel technical support at (800) 638- 8686.


The Flash32 network card is manufactured by Intel, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this products'
performance or reliability.
