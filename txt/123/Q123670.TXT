SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the Gateway Service for Netware (GSNW) or the Client
Service for Netware (CSNW) in Windows NT version 3.5, the following error
message appears, even though the protocol is installed:

   Please install the NWLINK IPX/SPX Compatible Transport before you install the
   Client/Gateway Services for Netware

CAUSE

This problem occurs if an OEMNSVx.INF file (where x is a number) exists in the

GSNW and CSNW in Windows NT version 3.1.

To correct this problem, remove all occurrences of OEMNSVx.INF and install GSNW
or CSNW again.
