KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 cannot gain access to the communication (COM) ports for detection.

CAUSE
=====

This symptom occurs if the Windows 3.1 communications application SuperVoice
version 2.0b is installed in Windows 95 when you add a new modem to the system.
This application copies a new communications driver called RHICOMM.DRV to the
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory and changes a line in the SYSTEM.INI file.

NOTE: The above symptom does not occur until you restart the system.

WORKAROUND
==========

Using a text editor such as MS-DOS Editor or Notepad, open the SYSTEM.INI file,
which is found in the Windows directory. In the [boot] section, locate the line
that reads:

   Comm.drv=Rhicomm.drv

Change this line to read:

   Comm.drv=Comm.drv

Save the changes and then restart the system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
