TITLE   :Opening a File Causes the Application to Close
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a file from an application that uses common dialog
boxes, the application appears to close.

CAUSE
=====

A bug in ChopText() (called by DlgDirList) trashes the stack in USER
server-side.C:\SW\MW\R2\LIB\SERVICES\NT almost fits into static control, while
C:\...\MW\R2\LIB\SERVICES\NT does fit, even though it is more characters. In
this case, ChopText substitutes the first 6 characters of the path with a prefix
containing 7 characters. The extra character is written in front of lpch, which
corrupts the stack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S.
Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
