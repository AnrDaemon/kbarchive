-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Mail for PC Networks administrator's may receive the one of the
following error messages when creating (adding) or deleting gateway addresses
from the gateway lists using the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE):

   Can not create user

   -or-

   Can not delete user

CAUSE
=====

The gateway address list is too large for ADMIN.EXE. These errors will happen
when the number of gateway addresses exceeds approximately 32,500 users.
However, this will depend on the amount of conventional memory on the
workstation running ADMIN.EXE and/or the length of the gateway names.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem use IMPORT.EXE to add or delete users from the gateway
lists (refer to Appendix A in the Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide" for
more information about the Import utility).
