KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the ATI Mach32 setup utility (INSTALL.EXE), you may be unable to
start the computer except in Safe Mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Windows 3.x drivers supplied by ATI conflict
with the Windows 95 drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

ATI has updated versions of the drivers available on its BBS. The updated
drivers work only if you have previously installed an ATI Windows 3.1 driver.
For more information about the updated versions of the video drivers, contact
ATI.
