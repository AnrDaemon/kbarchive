KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SUMMARY
=======

When you are running the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) Setup
Wizard, the OLE 2.01 (or OLE 2.02 if you have installed the Microsoft Access
version 2.0 Service Pack) option is selected by default only if you select the
Run With MSARN200 check box in the Add File dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not choose to include the Microsoft Access run-time executable file
MSARN200.EXE with your custom application, users of your application will need
to have a retail version of Microsoft Access to run your application. The retail
version of Microsoft Access includes the OLE dynamic-link library (DLL) files;
therefore, they do not need to be included by the Setup Wizard in your custom
application's Setup.

If you do choose to include the run-time executable file with your custom
application, the Setup Wizard will generate a warning if you choose not to
include the OLE files. If you choose OK in response to this warning, a flag is
set to prevent future warnings about the OLE files. This flag is saved with your
template.
