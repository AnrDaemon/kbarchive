The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Extended Help Compiler is not available in Traditional/Simplified Chinese
Windows version 3.1 SDK extension or in the Korean Windows version 3.1 SDK
extension. Therefore, large help files in Chinese or Korean cannot be compiled
under Windows version 3.1 using the extended help compiler.

However, large Chinese or Korean help files can be compiled under Windows NT, by
using Chinese or Korean Help Compiler (HC31.EXE). Make sure the directory
containing the appropriate HC31.EXE is in the path.

If the .HPJ file contains Compress=YES, change it to compress=MEDIUM or to
compress=FALSE.

The resulting .HLP files cannot be displayed correctly under Windows NT. If you
try it, you'll see random symbols in place of the Chinese or Korean characters.
To examine the result of the compilation, exit from Windows NT, and start
Chinese or Korean Windows. Then display the help files.
