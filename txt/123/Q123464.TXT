Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


IMPORTANT: How to Extract the Source Code from Vc20ctrl.exe
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once you obtain Vc20crtl.exe, run it using the -D option to extract the source
code and set up the correct directory structure:

   Vc20ctrl.exe -D

You need to use the -D option because Vc20ctrl.exe contains several hundred
files. The -D option sets up the directory structure for the sources. If you do
not use the -D option, you will run into problems attempting to build libraries
from the source.

You need approximately four megabytes of disk space to hold Vc20ctrl.exe and all
the files it contains. You'll need over 20 megabytes of disk space to rebuild
the run-time libraries from the source code. For more details on building the
sources, as well as other notes, please refer to the README.TXT file included
with the release.
