======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the "Running SMSVIEW Generator" section of the Microsoft Systems Management
Server Help file (SMS.HLP), the first paragraph states:

   The SMSVIEW program is automatically installed on primary site servers. You
   can start SMSVIEW using the SMSVIEW program item from the Systems Management
   Server program group. The SMSVIEW program runs on the Windows NT operating
   system.

The second sentence is incorrect because the SMSVIEW program item (icon) is not
created or available in the Systems Management Server program group by default.
If you want to use the SMSVIEW program, the location of the program is as
follows:

   SMS\SITE.SRV\<platform>.BIN

where <platform> can be one of the following:

   x86   (for Intel-based computers)
   MIPS  (for MIPS-based computers)
   Alpha (for Alpha-based computers)
