The NEC Triple Spin (3x) CD-ROMs are not supported devices under Windows
NT. Various problems may be encountered when using these devices with
Windows NT, including file copy and setup problems.

NOTE: The NEC CDR-500 (3Xi) and NEC CDR-600 (3Xe) are supported, but
require updated firmware.

Changing the operating mode may enable the device to function better under
Windows NT. To do this change the default settings on the configuration
switch block on the rear panel of the device. Switch number 3 should be set
to the ON position. This changes the operating mode from SCSI II to SCSI I.

Also, these devices should have at least firmware version 2.5.

NOTE: Making these changes does not guarantee that the device will function
correctly.
