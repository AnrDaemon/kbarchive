The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access a filename on a CD-ROM that is in lowercase, the
following error message appears:

   File not found.

The same is true when you attempt to access a directory in lowercase.

CAUSE
=====

ISO 9660 defines uppercase filenames only. The Windows NT CD-ROM file system
(CDFS) adheres to this and therefore expects names to be in uppercase.

STATUS
======

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.
