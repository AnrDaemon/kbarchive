The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Due to compatibility issues with some versions of NetWare 3.x, the NWLink
protocol code was developed in such a way that frame type entries appear in
uppercase only in both the PROTOCOL.INI and NET.CFG files. This article lists
the frame type entries for the NWLink protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To correctly modify network configurations, use the Network Setup program in
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. However, the two files can also be modified
manually. When you do this, the modification of the frame type must conform to
the uppercase specification made in the NWLink code. This means that both the
frame variable and frame type values must appear in uppercase only.

Valid Frame Type entries for Ethernet are:

   ETHERNET_802.2
   ETHERNET_802.3
   ETHERNET_II
   ETHERNET_SNAP

Valid Frame Type entries for Token Ring are:

   TOKEN_RING
   TOKEN_RING_SNAP

An example of a valid entry in PROTOCOL.INI and NET.CFG is:

   FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2
