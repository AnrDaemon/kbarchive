The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a Program Information File (PIF) for COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE, an
MS-DOS based application, such as EDIT.COM, that is run from AUTOEXEC.NT does
not have access to the keyboard interface. Keyboard strokes made during the
execution of the MS-DOS based application are displayed after you exit the
application. The mouse interface still works correctly.

If you run the same PIF without the MS-DOS based application in AUTOEXEC.NT and
load the application from the command prompt (either COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE),
this problem does not occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
