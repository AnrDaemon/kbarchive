KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Help Compiler generates Error 5059 stating that there is not enough memory
to build the help file.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs under each these conditions:

 - There is a graphic larger than 64K pasted directly into the .RTF file.

 - There is a corrupt graphic in the .RTF file.

 - The Help Compiler does not have enough memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can resolve the problem by following these steps:

1. Place large graphics (larger than 64K) in the .RTF file by reference. To
   insert a graphic by reference, type the following instead of pasting the
   graphic directly into the .RTF file:

         {bm$ graphfile}

   Where:

    - bm$ is either bml, bmr, or bmc:

       - Use bml for a left-aligned (left-justified) graphic.

       - Use bmr for a right-aligned (right-justified) graphic.

       - Use bmc for a character-aligned (character-justified) graphic.

    - graphfile is the name of the graphic file you want displayed in the
      compiled help file.

2. Replace any bad graphics embedded in the .RTF file.

3. To free memory, unload unneeded appliactions, device drivers, and
   memory-resident (TSR) programs before compiling again.
