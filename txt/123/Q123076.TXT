PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbprint kbimu kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a card to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 series printer, you
may receive the following error message:

   Integer divide by zero.

This behavior can occur if you did not select a paper size when you installed the
driver for the HP DeskJet 500 series printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, select a paper size for the printer you are using. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. In the Main program group, double-click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Printers.

3. In the list of installed printers, click the HP DeskJet 500 series printer
   you are using.

4. Click Setup.

5. Under Paper Size, click Letter - 8.5 x 11, and then click OK.

6. Close the Printers window, and then close Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message may also occur when you enter the Writing Studio and no
printer driver is installed. Because Creative Writer queries the printer driver
when it displays the Writing Studio, there must be a printer driver installed,
even if there is no printer. To resolve this issue, install a printer driver.

This issue does not occur in Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98.
