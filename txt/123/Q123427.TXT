MORE INFORMATION
================


Use the following commands to fix the project file:

1. Copy the database file to the directory containing Fixproj.exe.

   For example, if the error "Cannot find file: xcgaaaaa.a" occurs, copy the file
   DATA\X\XCGAAAAA (with no extension).

   NOTE: The default location of the DATA directory is a subdirectory of the
   SourceSafe directory. The SourceSafe administrator can move this location,
   however. Please consult your local administrator if you have any questions
   concerning the location of the SourceSafe DATA directory.

2. Execute the following command:

   FIXPROJ <filename> <path to data directory>

   For example:

   FIXPROJ xcgaaaaa f:\ss\data

3. When successfully completed, a NEWPRJ.OUT file will exist in the current
   directory. Copy this file to the missing/damaged database file's location.

   For example:

   COPY NEWPRJ.OUT f:\ss\data\x\xcgaaaaa.a

   If the file NEWPRJ.OUT does not exist, contact Microsoft SourceSafe technical
   support.
