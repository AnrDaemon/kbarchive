-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Notepad does not print tab characters that occur at the beginning of a line.
They are displayed on the screen properly, but will not show up in the printed
output. A document created in Notepad such as

   Non Tabbed Line
   <tab>Tabbed Line
   123<tab>TEST

would print the following:

   Non Tabbed Line
   Tabbed Line
   123 TEST

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, you can place a space at the beginning of the line and then use
the Tab key. For example, enter the following text in Notepad:

   <tab>Tabbed Line
   <space><tab>Space and then Tab
   123<tab>TEST

This text will print as:

   Tabbed Line
       Space and then Tab
   123   TEST

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
