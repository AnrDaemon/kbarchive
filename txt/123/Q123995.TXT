TITLE   :Mitsumi Driver Does Not Support Sound Blaster 16 Multi-CD-ROM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Mitsumi CD-ROM driver supplied with Windows NT version 3.5 does not support
the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 Multi-CD-ROM board (CT2230).

CAUSE
=====

The Mitsumi CD-ROM driver requires an I/O base address above 300H. The CT2230
automatically configures the I/O base address below 300H by adding 10H to the
audio settings. Valid audio settings for the Sound Blaster 16 board are 220H,
240H, 260H, or 280H. Therefore, the maximum I/O base address that can be
configured for the Mitsumi interface is 290H. This address does not work with
the Mitsumi CD-ROM driver.

The older version of the Sound Blaster Multi-CD-ROM board (CT1750) includes
additional jumpers to configure the Mitsumi interface separately and works with
the driver that is currently available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
