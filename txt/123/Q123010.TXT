======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running a Microsoft LAN Manager logon script from LMSCRIPT.PIF, system
performance may be degraded.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Foreground Priority and Background Priority are both
set to 10000 in the LMSCRIPT.PIF file and Background Execution is also
selected.

The result is that WinTimeSlice (Windows In Foreground) is dynamically set to
half the value selected for Background Priority in the PIF. Windows and Windows
for Workgroups automatically change the Windows In Foreground setting to 5000.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: The preferred solution is to set Background Priority in
          LMSCRIPT.PIF to 200. This leaves WinTimeSlice (Windows In
          Foreground) set to 100.

Method 2: Deselect Background Execution in LMSCRIPT.PIF.

Method 3: Open Control Panel and choose the 386 Enhanced icon. Set Windows
          In Background to 2500 and Windows In Foreground to 5000. This
          nullifies the changes caused by LMSCRIPT.PIF.
