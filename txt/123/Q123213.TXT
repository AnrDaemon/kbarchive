Microsoft Network Monitor is a component of Systems Management Server that
allows network administrators to detect and troubleshoot problems on the
network.

A Network Monitor Agent enables a client computer to be used by a remote
installation of Network Monitor to capture network statistics. One of the
requirements of a Network Monitor Agent is that it must run on a computer
running Windows NT to remotely capture network statistics. This process
cannot be accomplished on any other client computer such as a computer
running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. A computer running Windows for
Workgroups and Network Monitor Agent can only monitor locally.
