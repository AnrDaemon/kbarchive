TITLE   :Application Icon Does Not Minimize to the Taskbar
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you minimize an application, it does not minimize to the taskbar; instead,
the icon disappears.

CAUSE
=====

Some applications register a shell hook but do not forward it to the Windows
shell, even though Windows programming documentation indicates this should be
done. Because Windows 95 runs mainly in Ring 3, it cannot detect this hook and
therefore cannot keep track of the application's icon.

NOTE: If one application has this problem, it can prevent other applications from
minimizing to the taskbar as well.

The following applications are known to cause this problem:

 - Audio Control (AUDCNTRL.EXE). This file is included with the Toshiba T4800Ct.

 - TextBridge version 3.0 by Xerox Imaging Systems.

 - EclipseFind by Phoenix Technologies.


WORKAROUND
==========

Although you cannot see the minimized icon, you may be able to use the ALT+TAB
key combination to cycle through the running applications.

If you do not load the application that causes this problem, your other
applications minimize correctly.

NOTE: Applications can be executed automatically at Windows startup from the
Startup folder or the Load and Run lines of the WIN.INI file.
