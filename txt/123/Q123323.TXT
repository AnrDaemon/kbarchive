The information in this article applies to:

When you set up a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) Administrator to run
using an account other than the system account, the default database
directory for the WINS.MDB file is USERS\DEFAULT instead of
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\WINS, as the TCPIP.HLP file and Chapter 5 of the
"Windows NT Server TCP/IP" guide imply.

The WINS parameter for the path name of the WINS.MDB files is not in the
Registry when WINS is set up.

Regardless of the directory that the database is created in, you can set up
the WINS Server to use another directory for the database. Use Registry
Editor to enter the following subkey into the Registry

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   Subkey Name = DbFileNm
   Data Type = REG_EXPAND_SZ
   Range = path name
   Default = %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\WINS\WINS.MDB

to the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WINS\Parameters

If the WINS server is already active, use the Backup database function in
WINS Administrator prior to making the change to the Registry. After you
change the Registry, use the Restore database function as outlined in the
"Windows NT Server TCP/IP" guide on page 139.
