-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article provides a checklist of what must be accomplished before
Systems Management Server will install itself in the logon scripts
for a Microsoft network domain (Windows NT or LAN Manager):

1. Configure and enable the Directory Replicator service for the domain being
   managed by Systems Management Server. Systems Management Server looks for a
   REPL$ share on the domain controller (DC). If it doesn't exist, the Site
   Configuration Manager will not be able to copy the proper Systems Management
   Server logon support files to the Export\Scripts directory.

2. Using Systems Management Server Administrator, configure the Systems
   Management Server Site properties as follows:

   a. In the Clients dialog box, select Automatically Configure Workstation
      Logon Scripts.

   b. In the Domains dialog box, select Use All Detected Servers for each domain
      that you want logon scripts enabled.

   NOTE: At this point, Systems Management Server has been properly configured.
   It will then configure the user logon scripts for each domain to include the
   Smsls.bat entry, and copy the proper Systems Management Server support files
   to the REPL$ share during the next Site Configuration Manager watchdog cycle.
   This occurs by default every 24 hours, but can be forced immediately by using
   one of the two methods listed in step 3 below.

3. To force the watchdog cycle to occur immediately, use one of the following
   methods:

    - Toggle the Systems Management Server site property for logon scripts,
      changing it from its current state to the other state. This will toggle
      the site control file line "PROPERTY <Logon
      Scripts><><><1>" to 1 or 0. Site Configuration
      Manager will read this line and immediately configure the logon scripts
      appropriately. For example, if the Automatically Configure Workstation
      Logon Scripts site property in the Clients dialog box is clear, selecting
      it changes the flag from 0 to 1. This would then force Site Configuration
      Manager to configure logon scripts when it next reads the Sitectrl.ct1
      file.

    - Use the SENDCODE utility. It is located on the Systems Management Server
      CD, in the PSSTOOLS directory. At the Systems Management Server site
      server, go to a command prompt and type the following command:

   sendcode sms_site_config_manager 196

      If the Hierarchy Manager has not yet taken the proposed changes made for
      logon script configuration and passed this information to the Site
      Configuration Manager, the only way to expedite the process is to stop and
      restart the Hierarchy Manager service. If you use SENDCODE to force Site
      Configuration Manager to wake up under the old configuration (because
      Hierarchy Manager has not done its work yet) the configuration does not
      include the recent changes, and is a useless operation.

      This forces Site Configuration Manager to perform its watchdog cycle
      immediately and configure the Systems Management Server logon scripts for
      all users in the domains that were enabled in step 2 above.

NOTE: When you configure logon scripts in a domain that contains more than
one site server, do not use the Detect All Servers option. Be sure to
specify each server that is to be managed in the site properties for the
site that exclusively manages the server; otherwise two sites may compete
for the same server.
