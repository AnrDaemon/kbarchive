TITLE   :RUN Command Not Available in FoxPro for Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.6a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The FoxPro RUN command is not implemented in FoxPro for Macintosh. The Macintosh
operating system does not have the equivalent of an MS-DOS command prompt; so it
isn't possible to run an external program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Equivalent functionality can often be programmed through use of the FoxPro
RUNSCRIPT command to run an AppleScript to launch the external program.

To use this feature, perform these steps:

1. Use the AppleScript Script Editor to record or write a script that launches
   the desired application.

2. Save the newly created script.

3. In your FoxPro program, add the following command to run the AppleScript:

      RUNSCRIPT <script name>

NOTE: AppleScript is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding AppleScript's performance or
reliability.
