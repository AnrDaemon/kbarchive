The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) ToolTips feature is disabled in Windows NT
version 3.5 if the toolbar does not have current window focus (even if you have
selected Show ToolTips). ToolTips are not displayed when the mouse pointer is
over an icon on the toolbar.

CAUSE
=====

In MOM version 4.0, ToolTips caused newly started applications to lose focus.
They also became associated with other applications besides the toolbar. To fix
this, MOM version 4.2 under Windows NT only displays ToolTips when in focus.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable ToolTips, click the toolbar title once. If there is no title
displayed, move the mouse over the toolbar and click the right mouse button or
any icon to give the toolbar focus and enable ToolTips.
