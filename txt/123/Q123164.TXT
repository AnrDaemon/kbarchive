The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print from Wilson WindowWare WinCheck 3.0, you receive the
following error message:

   The above model is not supported by this driver. Default to <printer
   name>.

CAUSE
=====

WinCheck uses the name of the printer driver instead of the printer model name
when it calls ExtDeviceMode. If you are using a printer that is not the first
model name listed in the driver file, you receive the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you click OK after reading the above error message, you can still print;
however, you cannot change options such as the paper size, paper source,
resolution, and so on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Wilson WindowWare is aware of this problem. This situation is most likely caused
by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft has confirmed that it is not caused
by a problem in Windows 95. For more information about resolving this issue,
