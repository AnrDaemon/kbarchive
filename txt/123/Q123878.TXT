SYMPTOMS
========

When you follow the process for adding or removing a domain or site from a
Systems Management Server Primary Site, you may see warnings indicating that
sites, addresses, or machines are inconsistent with the database.

CAUSE
=====

The following situations can cause these messages:

 - A client machine is moved from one primary site database to another primary
   site database. When this happens the "losing" site database is not informed.
   This constitutes an "orphan" machine, and since the possibility exists that
   the entire domain was moved to a new site, a warning may be issued. If you do
   not want the machine movement, you (as the administrator), can increase the
   FalseLogonThreshold parameter in the registry. Movement from a secondary site
   to a parent site does not cause a problem because the existing machine
   inventory is updated with a new site code/domain name.

 - A child site detaches or is otherwise removed (secondary site) from the
   current site. When this happens the machine inventory is left behind. This is
   similar to the following situation.

 - One or more of the current site's domains are removed using the Site
   Properties <Domains> dialog. When this happens the machine inventory is
   left behind. Because the machine inventory is keyed to the Site/Domain
   combination, a warning appears when this combination is no longer valid.

 - Sites exist in the database which are not addressable (no sender address has
   been created). Also, when a site detaches, the parent's address to the child
   is automatically removed, but the inventory remains.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the database and prevent these message pop-ups, use a query to bring
up a list of candidate machines to be manually deleted. The query dialog can be
used to specify a particular site code, domain name, and so forth. In the case
of site address messages, an address will need to be created, or the ghost site
can be removed with the PREINST /DELSITE command (see the Admin documentation
for the Site Hierarchy Manager command-line syntax).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
