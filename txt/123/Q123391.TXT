TITLE   :PRB: Random Symbols on Dialog Box in Japanese Windows

SYMPTOMS
========

While using the Japanese Resource compiler to compile a Japanese resource file,
and running it under Japanese Windows, you see random symbols on the dialog box
where Japanese characters should be.

CAUSE
=====

Arial, Times New Roman, and Helvetica fonts work well with English characters
and most European characters, but not with Japanese characters. The Japanese
fonts that have font names starting with '@' are vertical fonts, meaning they
are designed specifically for vertical writing (writing from top to bottom and
right to left). They are not suitable for English where writing is horizontal
(left to right).

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Japanese font for that dialog box. If no particular Japanese font is
desired, use the system font (a Japanese font under Japanese Windows) by
omitting the FONT resource statement from your dialog template, or send the
WM_SETFONT message with the system font to the control that contains Japanese
characters.
