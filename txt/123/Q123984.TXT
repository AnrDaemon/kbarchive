TITLE   :DNS Lookup Does not Check List of Domain Suffixes
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When "Enable DNS for Windows Names" is selected and you attempt to access a
NetBIOS-based system residing in a DNS domain outside of your workstation's
default DNS domain, the NetBIOS system is not found.

For example, when you run NET VIEW SYS1 where SYS1 resides in
DOMAIN1.COMPANYNAME.COM, while the workstation resides in
DOMAIN2.COMPANYNAME.COM., Error 53 is returned. The trace shows that the
workstation sent a DNS query for SYS1.DOMAIN2.COMPANYNAME.COM, but never for
SYS1.DOMAIN1.COMPANYNAME.COM, even though DOMAIN1.COMPANYNAME.COM is in the list
of domain suffixes.

The workstation should cycle through the list of domain suffixes until it finds
the system.

When you run PING SYS1, the workstation sends out a query for
SYS1.DOMAIN2.COMPANYNAME.COM, and then for SYS1.DOMAIN1.COMPANYNAME.COM.

When you run NET VIEW \\SYS1, the workstation sends out a query for only
SYS1.DOMAIN2.COMPANYNAME.COM.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups versions 3.11 and 3.11a. This problem was corrected in TCP/IP-32 for
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11b.

TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 3.11b is available on the Windows NT 3.51
compact disc.
