The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Write application to select and use the Type 1 font
ZapfDingbats, a different font is displayed when you type. After you select the
ZapfDingbats font in the Fonts dialog box, the correct font is displayed in the
Samples window. However, after you choose the OK button, the text in the
document is displayed with the closest screen font, such as Wingdings, instead
of ZapfDinbats.

The identical font installation is used for the ZapfDingbats font and other Type
1 fonts, but the other Type 1 fonts act as expected using the correct font in
both the sample window and the document


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
