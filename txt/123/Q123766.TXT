-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One bullet item on page 106 (Chapter 5) of the Microsoft Windows NT Server
TCP/IP version 3.5 guide and the TCP/IP Online Help (TCPIP.HLP on the
Windows NT Server version 3.5 CD) titled WINS Benefits states:

   The ability for clients on a Windows NT Server network (including
   Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups, and LAN Manager 2.x) to browse
   domains on the far side of a router without a local domain controller
   being present on the other side of the router.

This paragraph is not completely true. LAN Manager 2.x client computers
cannot browse domains spanning subnets across routers. These client
computers listen to server announcements and keep them in their caches.
They do not use WINS for browsing purposes. LAN Manager 2.x uses WINS for
the purpose of replacing the LMHOSTS file for NetBIOS name resolution.

Additional query words: wfw wfwg prodnt
