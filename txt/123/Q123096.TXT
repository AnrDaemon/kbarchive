SYMPTOMS
========

After you type "setup" (without the quotation marks) to start the Microsoft
Windows 95 Setup program, you may receive the following error message:

   Setup Warning G1: Setup cannot run from MS-DOS with EMM386.EXE or other
   memory managers (such as QEMM or 386Max) running on your computer. If Windows
   is on your computer, run Setup from Windows. Otherwise, remove the memory
   manager from your CONFIG.SYS file, and then restart your computer before
   running Setup. After Windows 95 is installed, you can safely add the memory
   manager back to your CONFIG.SYS file.

CAUSE

Some Gateway 2000 computers are equipped with BIOS chip sets that cause this
error message to appear when you run Setup from MS-DOS and you are loading
EMM386.EXE, or a similar memory manager, in the CONFIG.SYS file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this error message:

 - Remove EMM386.EXE (or the similar memory manager) before you run Setup.

   -or-

 - Run Setup from within Windows (for example, perform an upgrade over a
   previous version of Windows or Windows for Workgroups).

   -or-

 - Upgrade the BIOS in your computer.
