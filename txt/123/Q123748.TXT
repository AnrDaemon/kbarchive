TITLE   :SNA Server Err Msg: Event 23, Outage Code "2D" (Abnormal Resp.)
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1,2.11 SP2,3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,3.0 SP3,4.0,4.0 SP1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft SNA Server Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) connection is
configured with the Maximum BTU Size set to a value less than the maximum frame
size of the remote system (set using the PU macro MAXDATA parameter in VTAM),
the following SNA Server connection failure may be logged in the Windows NT
application event log:

   Event 23, Outage code "2D" (abnormal response)

CAUSE
=====

The abnormal response error occurs if the host banner screen (that is, the
USSTAB message 10 screen) exceeds the Maximum BTU size set in SNA Server.
Because the maximum frame size is not negotiated until a BIND takes place, the
SNA Server's maximum frame size can be exceeded.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change the SNA Server Maximum BTU size to match the
value used on the remote system.

NOTE: If an IBM SDLC adapter or MicroGate SDLC adapter is being used with SNA
Server, the maximum frame size supported by Microsoft SNA Server is 521. Other
SDLC adapters do not have this restriction.
