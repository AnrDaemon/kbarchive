TITLE   :SMTP: Err Msg: Can Not Use Indirect Postoffice to Forward Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error when you install the Microsoft Mail Gateway
for SMTP Access:

   Can not use indirect postoffice to forward mail

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you try to assign an indirect postoffice to be the gateway
postoffice during the installation process.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to ensure that the gateway postoffice is direct to the
local postoffice:

1. Stop the installation procedure.

2. Start the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE).

3. Select External, Admin-Modify to modify the relationship to the gateway
   postoffice.

4. Quit ADMIN.EXE.

5. Install the Access component.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The network and postoffice name you specify during the access component
installation does not have to be the gateway postoffice name. It could be a
forwarding postoffice, which has a direct relationship to the gateway
postoffice. You can make a chain of direct relationships to the gateway
postoffice.

Additional query words: access install
