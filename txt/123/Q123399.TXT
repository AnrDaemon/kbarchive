TITLE   :ADT2: Uninstalling ADT Does Not Unregister Custom Controls
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

When you uninstall the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) by choosing the
Remove All button in the ADT Setup program, the custom controls are not
recognized as shared components and are not removed from the registration
database.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you uninstall the ADT, manually remove the custom controls from the
registration database by following these steps:

1. In Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

2. In the Command Line box, type "regedit.exe" (without the quotation marks),
   and then choose OK.

3. In the Registered File Types box, select the custom control you want to
   remove.

4. From the Edit menu, choose Delete File Type.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each custom control you want to remove.

6. When you are finished, quit and then restart Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

CAUTION: Following these steps will remove the ADT from your computer.

1. Start the ADT Setup program by double-clicking the MS ADT Setup icon in the
   ADT program group.

2. Choose the Remove All button. When you are prompted "Are you sure you want to
   remove this application?" choose Yes.

3. When Setup is finished, start Microsoft Access and then open the sample
   database NWIND.MDB.

4. Create a blank, new form.

5. From the Edit menu, choose Insert Object.

6. Select the Insert Control option button. Note that the custom controls (the
   calendar, data outline, and scroll bar controls) appear as if they are
   available because they have not been removed from the registration database.
