 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:

SUMMARY
=======

In a Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) application, you can attach control bars
such as status bars and toolbars to a frame window. However, for many
applications a simple dialog-based user interface is sufficient. MFC does not
provide built-in support for adding control bars to dialogs.

DLGCBR is a sample application that demonstrates how to add a status bar and
toolbar to a dialog. In addition, it demonstrates a number of techniques related
to using a modeless dialog as the main window of an MFC application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add a control bar to a dialog, you must create the control bar as usual, and
then make room for the control bar within the client area of the dialog. For the
control bar to function properly, the dialog must duplicate some of the
functionality of frame windows. If you want ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handlers to
work for the control bars, you also need to derive new control bar classes, and
handle the WM_IDLEUPDATECMDUI message. If your dialog is not the main window of
your application, you will also need to modify its parent frame window to pass
the WM_IDLEUPDATECMDUI message on to the dialog's control bars.

To make room for a control bar within the client area of the dialog, follow these
steps in your dialog's OnInitDialog() function:

1. Create the control bars.

2. Figure out how much room the control bars will take by using the reposQuery
   option of RepositionBars():

      CRect rcClientStart;
      CRect rcClientNow;
      GetClientRect(rcClientStart);
      RepositionBars(AFX_IDW_CONTROLBAR_FIRST,
                     AFX_IDW_CONTROLBAR_LAST,
                     0, reposQuery, rcClientNow);

3. Move all the controls in your dialog to account for space used by control
   bars at the top or left of the client area. If your dialog contains a menu,
   you also need to account for the space used by the menu:

      CPoint ptOffset(rcClientStart.left - rcClientNow.left,
                      rcClientStart.top - rcClientNow.top);
      ptOffset.y += ::GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYMENU);

      CRect rcChild;
      CWnd* pwndChild = GetWindow(GW_CHILD);
      while (pwndChild)
      {
         pwndChild->GetWindowRect(rcChild);
         rcChild.OffsetRect(ptOffset);
         pwndChild->MoveWindow(rcChild, FALSE);
         pwndChild = pwndChild->GetNextWindow();
      }

4. Increase the dialog window dimensions by the amount of space used by the
   control bars:

      CRect rcWindow;
      GetWindowRect(rcWindow);
      rcWindow.right += rcClientStart.Width() - rcClientNow.Width();
      rcWindow.bottom += rcClientStart.Height() - rcClientNow.Height();
      MoveWindow(rcWindow, FALSE);

5. Position the control bars using RepositionBars().

To update the first pane of a status bar with menu item text, you must handle
WM_MENUSELECT, WM_ENTERIDLE, and WM_SETMESSAGESTRING in your dialog class. You
need to duplicate the functionality of the CFrameWnd handlers for these
messages. See the CModelessMain class in the sample program for examples of
these message handlers.

To allow ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handlers to work for other status bar panes and for
toolbar buttons, you must derive new control bar classes and implement a message
handler for WM_IDLEUPDATECMDUI. This is necessary because the default control
bar implementations of OnUpdateCmdUI() assume the parent window is a frame
window. However, it doesn't do anything but pass the parent window pointer on to
a function which only requires a CCmdTarget pointer. Therefore, you can
temporarily tell OnUpdateCmdUI() that the parent window pointer you are giving
it is a CFrameWnd pointer to meet the compiler requirements. Here's an example:

      LRESULT CDlgToolBar::OnIdleUpdateCmdUI(WPARAM wParam,
                                             LPARAM lParam)
      {
         if (IsWindowVisible())
         {
            CFrameWnd* pParent = (CFrameWnd*)GetParent();
            if (pParent)
               OnUpdateCmdUI(pParent, (BOOL)wParam);
         }
         return 0L;
      }

To pass WM_IDLEUPDATECMDUI messages on to dialogs other than the main window,
save dialog pointers in your frame window class and create a WM_IDLEUPDATECMDUI
handler in that class. The handler should send the WM_IDLEUPDATECMDUI message on
to the dialog child windows by using CWnd::SendMessageToDescendants(). Then
perform default processing for the message within the frame window.
