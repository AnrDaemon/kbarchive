-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT 3.5, if you print any type of graphics or True Type fonts on an
Okidata ML320 (using the OKI9.DLL file) dot matrix printer, the printout may
contain garbage or incorrectly formatted characters. Because dot-matrix printers
print True Type fonts as graphics, all True Type fonts are affected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print text correctly, use a built-in printer font, such as Courier 12CPI.
There is no workaround for printing True Type fonts or graphics.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
