SUMMARY
=======

The documentation states that when using the library option of the comment
pragma the specified library name will be inserted before the default library
name in the object module. This is not the case; the given library name appears
after the default library name. This agrees with the next statement in the
documentation which states that using this pragma is the same as giving the
library to LINK on the command line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the order of the default library and an added library is important, compiling
with the /Zl switch will prevent the default library name from being placed in
the object module. A second comment pragma then can be used to insert the name
of the default library after the added library. The libraries listed with these
pragmas will appear in the object module in the same order they are found in the
source code.
