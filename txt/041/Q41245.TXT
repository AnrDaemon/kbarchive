The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

When you FORMAT a floppy disk using the Microsoft MS-DOS Packaged Product
version 4.0 or later, the FORMAT utility command issues the following prompt for
a volume label if no parameters are specified:

   Volume label (11 characters, ENTER for none)?

This procedure is a change in functionality from previous versions, which
required the /V switch for a volume label.

If you don't need a volume label for the disk, press the ENTER key when the above
prompt is issued by the FORMAT command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information about the /V switch for the FORMAT utility command
appears on page 78 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Reference" manual:

   /v:label   Specifies the volume label to use. A volume label
              identifies the disk and can be up to 11 characters in
              length (no tabs allowed). If you do not specify the /v
              switch, or specify it without giving the volume label,
              you are automatically prompted for the volume label
              after the format operation completes.
