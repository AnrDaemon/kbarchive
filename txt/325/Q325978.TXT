RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they

Use the Microsoft DirectX Diagnostic Tool to determine how much video memory is
installed on your video adapter. To do this, follow these steps.

NOTE: If your video acceleration is not set to Full, the diagnostic tool may
report less memory than is actually present on your video adapter. See the "More
Information" section of this article for steps to make sure that your video
acceleration is set correctly before you run this test.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. Click the Display tab or Display 1 tab.

4. Under Device, note how much video memory is listed next to Approx. Total
   Memory.

5. Click Exit.

If less than 4 megabytes (MB) of video memory is installed on your video adapter,
install additional video memory, or install a video adapter with more video
memory.

If this does not resolve the problem, go to method 2.

Method 2: Install the Latest Video Driver for Your Video Adapter:
