SUMMARY
=======

When you play MechWarrior 4 in multiplayer mode, players and factions use
insignia graphics to identify their equipment. You can use custom decals for
this purpose. This article describes how to use custom decals in MechWarrior 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use custom decals in MechWarrior 4, follow these steps:

1. Save your custom decals in the following folder

   <drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\MechWarrior
   Vengeance\Content\Textures\Customdecals

   where <drive> is the drive on which MechWarrior 4 is installed.

   NOTE: This path assumes a default installation and might be different on your
   computer.

2. To turn on custom decals, start MechWarrior 4, click Multiplayer, click
   Options, and then click to select the Allow Custom Decals check box.

3. Use the scroll arrows next to Player Insignia and Faction Insignia to select
   the custom decals that you want to use.

   Your custom decals are included in the insignia choices.

4. Click Reset.

NOTE: Custom decals may take a long time to load by modem. If you use custom
decals in games that are run on modem servers, the mission load time may be
long. Administrators of modem servers may want to disallow the use of custom
decals.
