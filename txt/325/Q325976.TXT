TITLE   :Flight Simulator: Reverse Thrusters Do Not Work Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to use keyboard commands to control throttle or reverse thrusters in
Flight Simulator, the intended function may not respond, or it may respond only
intermittently.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur when you use certain joysticks in combination with the
keyboard. Some controller devices send a continuous stream of information to the
computer. This information may take priority over the information that you send
through your keyboard. In some situations, this may cause the behavior described
in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods, as appropriate to your
situation.

Update Your Joystick Device Driver
----------------------------------

It may be possible to resolve this issue by installing updated device drivers for
your joystick.

For information about how to contact the manufacturer of your joystick to obtain
updated device drivers, click the appropriate article number in the following

documentation to complete these steps.

Turn Off (Disable) Your Joystick
--------------------------------

1. Start Flight Simulator, and then click Settings.

2. Click to clear the Enable Joystick check box.

Use a Different Joystick

a different joystick with Flight Simulator.
