SUMMARY
=======

The System Management Server Resource Guide, on page 398 under the "Distributing
Form Files (.xnf)" topic, contains an error.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To properly distribute .xnf forms, you must create a software distribution
package for the forms and then use an advertisement to place the forms on the
clients. You must include a command that installs the forms on the clients.

The System Management Server Resource Guide incorrectly states that you must
install the form to the %SystemRoot%\MS\SMS\Bin folder. However, the correct
location in which to install the forms is the %SystemRoot%\MS\SMS\Core\Bin
folder.
