KEYWORDS:kbvfp600 kbXBase kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbVS600sp4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SYS(2800) function controls Active Accessibility (AA) options in Visual
FoxPro 6.0. Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4 adds this function to Visual FoxPro
6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One of the Windows 2000 Logo requirements is that Accessibility clients, such as
the Magnifier utility, be able to follow the keyboard focus as a user moves from
control to control. Because Visual FoxPro controls are bitmaps and not windows,
they do not offer an interface that allows for the detection of keyboard
movements by the operating system. For example, in Visual FoxPro, forms and the
Visual FoxPro desktop are windows. Objects such as command buttons, list boxes,
combo boxes, and text boxes are bitmaps in windows.

The SYS(2800,nflags) functions accept the following parameters for the NFLAGS
value:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Value | Description                                                                         | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0     | Active Accessibility disabled.                                                      | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 32    | Used to create a  fake caret. For AA client apps that follow the caret (magnifier). |
