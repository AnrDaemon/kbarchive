TITLE   :SMS: Invalid Pointer Causes Low-rights Client Install to Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbClient kbsms200 kbDiscovery

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a non-administrative user installs the Systems Management Server 2.0 client
on a Windows NT 4.0 system via the logon installation method, installation fails
and no client components are installed. When this behavior occurs, the following
error is present in the Wn_logon.log:

   ASSIGNMENT ***************************************
   Before adding new sites, there are 1 site keys and 0 sites in the site list
      Site Key #0: "XXX"
   Some sites in the registry are not assigned
   Assessing assignment state from "\SITES\XXX"
   Calling GetAccessiblePath with \SITES\XXX\ 
   GetAccessiblePath failed for NAL path \SITES\XXX\. Error = 0x80004003
   Warning: Unable to Check Assignment for site "XXX" - Invalid pointer
   After adding any new sites, there are 1 site keys and 0 sites in the site list
      Site Key #0: "XXX" 
   Not writing Site List data back to the registry (no new sites)
   Client is not assigned to any sites - finished.
    STATUS CALLBACK -  -
   ReWriteSitesRegistry returning 28931
   Finished CliEx processing.
   Unloading CliEx.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the logged on user is not able to create registry
entries under the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT registry hive. As a result, Network
Abstraction Layer (NAL) components are not installed correctly and the client
installation cannot be completed.

RESOLUTION
==========

On the system experiencing this problem, verify the Interactive Group has the
following permissions on HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and all its subkeys:

 - Query Value

 - Set Value

 - Create Subkey

 - Enumerate Subkeys

 - Notify

 - Delete

 - Read Control

NOTE: These are the default permissions for the Interactive Group, but may have
been changed by an administrator for security purposes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Systems Management Server client core components are installed, several
Nal.dll files must be registered under the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT registry hive. If
these files are not registered, NAL is unable to resolve paths on behalf of
System Management Server client components, resulting in failure to install the
client.
