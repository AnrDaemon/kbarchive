TITLE   :XFOR: Inbody Addressing Doesn't Work aft. Moving SNADS Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After moving a working SNADS connector to a different server in a different
site, the Inbody addressing feature may not work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be a result of the SNADS addressing using the previous Exchange
Server Routing Group Name when the default SNADS address used for Inbody
addressing was changed to the new default site name.

The default SNADS address uses the first eight characters of the Exchange Server
site name.

Example: SNADS SITENAME(&m)

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Change the Routing Group Name in SNA Directory services, to match the
   existing SNADS site addressing on Exchange Server.

   or

 - Change Site Addressing on the new Exchange Server site to match the SNADS
   address that is configured on the host in SNA Directory services.
