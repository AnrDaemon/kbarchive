-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The ILOVEYOU virus and its variants attack files with an .sct extension. The
virus replaces the .sct files with copies of the virus. SCT is an extension for
script files as well as for FoxPro forms, which is why the Visual FoxPro files
are affected. Because the .sct files are replaced, to recover your forms you
must restore the .scx and .sct files from an uninfected backup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not have a backup, but you have built an .app or .exe, ReFox, from
Xitech, may help you recover the code from your SCTs. For more information about
ReFox, see the following Web sites:

You can also use Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (VSS), which is part of Visual
Studio, to help you recover your files if you have been using Visual SourceSafe
and regularly checking your work back into the VSS database.
