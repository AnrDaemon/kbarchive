TITLE   :XFOR: Non-Delivery Report: 554 Mailbox Is Not Local
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you send a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) message to the Internet
Mail Service in Microsoft Exchange Server, you may receive the following
non-delivery report (NDR):

   554 Mailbox is not local: sender's SMTP address

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NDR can occur if the Exchange-based server only accepts secure connections
and if the "Clients can only submit if homed on this server" check box on the
Connections tab has been selected. If the "Only from clients using" option in
the Accept Connections section on the Connections tab in the Internet Mail
Service is selected, the server is configured for secure connections.

If the "Clients can only submit if homed on this server" option is configured on
the Connections tab in the Internet Mail Service, you must choose an option from
the "Only from hosts using" box. Acceptable options include Authentication or
"Authentication and Encrypt".

If you enable SMTP Log logging on the server, the following events may be
reported in the log file depending on which secure connection method between the
two SMTP hosts is defined. The following example uses Windows NT
Challenge/Response authentication and encryption:
