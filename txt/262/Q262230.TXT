SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows Installer is an installation technology that streamlines the
program installation process and offers continued resiliency for programs,
including the ability to install additional features on demand, automatically
repair programs, uninstall programs cleanly, and roll back programs reliably.
This technology is included with Windows 2000 and Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0.

When you use SMS 2.0 to deploy Windows Installer Setup packages, you gain
additional change and configuration benefits. For example, you can use SMS to
deploy Windows Installer Setup packages (.msi files) throughout your
organization.

Various white papers and Microsoft Knowledge Base articles exist that detail
general deployment and usage issues for Windows Installer.
