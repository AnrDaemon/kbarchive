TITLE   :XCON: In Multiple Domain Setups NDRs All Originate from 1 Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Exchange Server Organizations with multiple domains set up, Non Delivery
Receipts (NDRs) may appear to originate from a single domain. If this is
unacceptable, you can apply Least Cost Routing, but in some cases this does not
work as expected.

CAUSE
=====

The Least Cost Routing feature is only enabled in Exchange Server Service Pack 3
or later.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, apply Exchange Server SP 3. If you are already running
SP 3 or later and you are still experiencing the same problem, follow these
steps:

1. Stop all services.

2. Reapply Exchange Server SP 3, unless subsequent service packs have been
   applied, at which point these will need to be removed before reapplying
   Exchange Server SP 3.

3. Reapply subsequent service packs if you need to.

4. Restart services.
