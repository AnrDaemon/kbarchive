TITLE   :"Stop 0x50" in Win32k.sys with Windows NT Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, on
high-capacity servers, you may receive a "Stop 0x50" error message in Win32k.sys
sporadically.


CAUSE
=====

While it is walking through the buffer backwards, the code accesses memory
beyond the end of the area allocated. This occurs only when the font that is
currently being rendered is very small.

Another cause for the "Stop 0x50" error message is that for each desktop there is
a buffer that is used to convert raw keyboard input to a format that can be sent
to a window in a message. When there are many keystrokes in the queue, writing
may occur past the end of the buffer.
