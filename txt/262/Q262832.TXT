   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you adjust a network setting on a node in an already functioning cluster
and you restart the node, the Cluster service may not start on that node and the
following Event ID may be displayed in the system log:

   Event ID: 7023
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Description: The Cluster Server service terminated with the following error:
   The endpoint cannot be created

If you attempt to manually start the Cluster service using the Services tool in
Control Panel, the following error message may be displayed:

   Could not start the Cluster Server service on <MachineName>
   Error 1720 The endpoint cannot be created

CAUSE
=====

The error message occurs when RPC remote procedure call (RPC) is unable to bind
to the Cluster Datagram Protocol (CDP). This transport is used for the heartbeat
interface for inter-node communication in the cluster.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, locate the following registry keys and make the
appropriate adjustments if the keys are missing, damaged, or have improper
permissions:

 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock\Setup
   Migration\Providers\Clusnet

 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock\Setup Migration

   Value Name: Provider List
   Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
   Data: Clusnet (There will be other data values for this key as well)

 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock\Parameters

   Value Name: Transports
   Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
   Data: Clusnet (There will be other data values for this key as well)

NOTE: If all of the registry keys are correct, you may need to reinstall the
Cluster service on the node.
