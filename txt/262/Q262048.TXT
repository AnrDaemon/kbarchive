TITLE   :XCON: Instances Don't Appear in MSExchangeMTA Connections Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you first set up a new Microsoft Exchange Server computer in an existing
site, you may not see anything listed in the Instance box under the
MSExchangeMTA Connections object in Microsoft Windows NT Performance Monitor.
You may be able to see the new global address list, which confirms that
directory replication has occurred between this server and the others in the
site. In addition, other servers in this site are able to see the new Exchange
Server computer. There are no error or warning messages in the application event
log of Windows NT Event Viewer that relate to this event.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, send an e-mail message from the new Exchange Server
computer to a user in the site. After an e-mail link has been established, all
of the instances appear in Performance Monitor.
