PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Security Configuration Manager tool and click Read, the tool
automatically selects Read & Execute. When you click OK or Apply, the tool
seems to make the changes. However, when you check the values for these items on
the tree, you can observe that no changes occurred.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because there is a design problem with the Security
Configuration Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, click Read & Execute before you click Read.
This action can enable the Security Configuration Manager to apply the changes
correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
