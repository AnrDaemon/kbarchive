PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a player attempts to self-destruct in Microsoft Allegiance, nothing
happens.

CAUSE
=====

The CTRL+SHIFT+D (3x) key combination is incorrectly labeled "Suicide" on the
Basic Controls page of the Allegiance Survival Guide.

RESOLUTION
==========

The CTRL+SHIFT+D (3x) key combination is mapped to the Eject From Turret
action.

The CTRL+SHIFT+D (3x) key combination is only effective when a player is a turret
gunner and attempts to eject from the turret. A player may want to eject from a
turret before the ship reaches a base or before the ship is destroyed.
