TITLE   :Options Are Not Sent to DHCP Clients Using DHCP Inform Packets
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) clients that request additional
option information from a Windows NT 4.0 (any service pack) DHCP server by
issuing a DHCP Inform packet, do not receive the additional information from the
DHCP server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Windows NT 4.0 does not support DHCP Inform
packets. When a client sends a DHCP Inform packet, the Windows NT 4.0 DHCP
Server ignores the DHCP Inform packet because it does not know how to process
it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To configure custom options to be sent to a client from a Windows NT 4.0 DHCP
server, the client must request the options in the Parameter Request List of the
DHCP Request packet or upgrade the DHCP server to Windows 2000 DHCP server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows 2000 DHCP server does support DHCP Inform packets.

Additional query words: DHCPInform rfc 2132
