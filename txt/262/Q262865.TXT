TITLE   :XCON: Do Not Replay .dat Files Removed by Mtacheck Utility
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Mtacheck.out subfolder that contains .dat files may be located in the
Exchsrvr\Mtadata folder. If you add the .dat files that are located in the
Mtacheck.out subfolder to the parent Mtadata folder, a variety of error messages
may be displayed and erratic behavior may occur.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Mtacheck.out subfolder contains message data
.dat files or corresponding reference .dat files that the message transfer agent
(MTA) cannot process.

The Mtacheck utility creates the Mtacheck.out subfolder automatically. When you
run the Mtacheck utility, files are placed in the Mtacheck.out subfolder because
they cannot be processed by the MTA for various reasons, typically because a
data .dat file does not have a corresponding reference .dat file, or a reference
.dat file does not have a corresponding data .dat file.

If you use certain switches to run the Mtacheck utility, some Exchange Server
system messages may also be removed to the Mtacheck.out subfolder, such as
directory replication messages, public folder replication messages, or link
monitor messages. You do not need to replace these files because they will be
automatically resent.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do not re-add the files that are located in the
Mtacheck.out subfolder to the parent Mtadata folder. If you do, a variety of
error messages are displayed, and erratic behavior occurs. The .dat files that
are located in the Mtacheck.out subfolder were removed for a reason, and are
only retained for reference and for troubleshooting.

NOTE: You can only run the Mtacheck utility if there are no .dat files in the
Mtacheck.out subfolder. If you want to keep the files that are located there for
further research or troubleshooting, rename the Mtacheck.out subfolder. When you
run the Mtacheck utility again, it automatically re-creates the Mtacheck.out
subfolder.
