The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the SMS_DEF.MOF is edited to enable Win32_NTLogEvent, and all items under
this class are turned on, an error message appears in the HINV32.log on the
client when hardware inventory is taken. The error is documented in the log as
follows:

   CLASS - Process Class: Win32_NTEventlogFile $$&<Hardware Inventory
   Agent&>&<Fri May 05 10:00:14.466
   2000&>&<thread=175 (0xAF)&>

   WARNING - Unable to return all values of property Sources of
   Win32_NTEventlogFile, max length reached !! $$<Hardware Inventory
   Agent><Fri May 05 10:00:20.775 2000><thread=175 (0xAF)>

   CLASS - Process Class: Win32_NTLogEvent $$<Hardware Inventory
   Agent><Fri May 05 10:00:21.186 2000><thread=175 (0xAF)>

   WARNING - Property EventIdentifier of Win32_NTLogEvent has been skipped.
   Integer 2147490648 is too large !! $$<Hardware Inventory Agent><Fri
   May 05 10:00:21.837 2000><thread=175 (0xAF)>

   WARNING - Property EventIdentifier of Win32_NTLogEvent has been skipped.
   Integer 2147489653 is too large !! $$<Hardware Inventory Agent><Fri
   May 05 10:00:22.127 2000><thread=175 (0xAF)>

This problem appears to be limited to the EventIdentifier object under the
WIN32_NTLogEvent class.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not turn on the Win32_NTLogEvent class or collect the EventIdentifier object
for inventory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
