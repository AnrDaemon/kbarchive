======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SMS Provider may fail to use the cache when it enumerates User Group
membership. This may also cause collections to refresh slower when accessing a
user account that gains rights to User Group Membership. Also, this increases
the traffic to the Primary Domain Controller (PDC).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0, SP1. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
