TITLE   :XADM: Information Store Stops & Error "4294966781" Is Generated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The information store stops, and the following server-specific error message
appears:

   Error 2140. Internal Windows NT error.

The following Event ID is then generated in the Windows NT Event Viewer
Application log:

   Event ID: 7024
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Type:Error
   Description:
   The Microsoft Exchange Information Store stopped with Service Specific Error
   4294966781.

CAUSE
=====

Third-party antivirus software performs a scan on the Exchange server itself.
While performing this scan, the antivirus software sees the log files located in
the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directories as a virus-infected document.

It then removes the log file and either place it in a quarantine folder or
recycle bin. This depends on the configuration of the antivirus software. After
this happens, the logs are out of sequence and the service stops. This causes
inconsistencies in the databases.

Server Specific Error 4294966781 equates to JET_errInvalidLogSequence. The log
files are out of sequence.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure to exclude all of the Exchsrvr directories from being scanned by
third-party antivirus software.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, restore your system from the last-known, functional
backup. If such a backup is unavailable, then your only other option may be to
use a utility to repair the database(s).
