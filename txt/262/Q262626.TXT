SUMMARY
=======

By default, IIS 4.0 has one ASP thread queue for all applications marked to run
in the Inetinfo memory space and one ASP thread queue per isolated application.
An isolated application is one defined as having the Run in separate Memory
Space check box selected. This is to say that Inetinfo.exe has a set of ASP
threads equal to the number that is set for Processorthreadmax (default 10)
multiplied by the number of processors recognized by Windows NT 4.0.

IIS 5.0 has an ASP thread queue for those sites running in Low(IIS Process), one
for Medium(Pooled), and one for each site (or virtual directory) set to run in
High(Isolated). In IIS 5.0, the tunable value that controls this is
AspProcessorThreadMax, which is set in the metabase, and by default is 25.

This value applies independently for each process that is using the ASP.dll
file.

If all applications on the server are configured to run in process, then Requests
Executing should never exceed ProcessorThreadMax*#ofProcessors (IIS 4.0) or
AspProcessorThreadMax*#ofProcessors (IIS 5.0).

Based on the configuration of the Web server, any number of ASP threads can be
running on the Web server.
