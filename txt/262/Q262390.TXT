TITLE   :Network Discovery Returns DHCP Reservation Name w/ Windows DHCP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbDiscovery

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an IP address is reserved in a Windows 2000 Domain Host Connection Protocol
(DHCP) server, Network Discovery returns the DHCP reservation name instead of
the computer's NetBIOS name.

If the DHCP reservation name is not the same as the computer's NetBIOS name, the
computer is incorrectly listed in the Systems Management Server Administrator
console. The incorrect listing is corrected by the next logon or heartbeat
discovery.

WORKAROUND
==========

When specifying the reservation name in DHCP, use the computer's NetBIOS name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
