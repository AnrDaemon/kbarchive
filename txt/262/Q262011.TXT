TITLE   :Allegiance: Stand-Alone Server Is Not Updated Automatically
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbimu msgame

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you uninstall a Microsoft Allegiance stand-alone server, the server may not
be updated automatically when you reinstall the server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Filelist.txt file remains in the Server folder
after you uninstall the stand-alone Allegiance server.

This file contains the previous server information, and is not updated
automatically with the new server information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Delete the Filelist.txt file from the following folder

   <drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Allegiance\Server

   where <drive> is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Allegiance
   is installed.

2. Reinstall the Allegiance stand-alone server.

3. Connect to the Allegiance stand-alone server. The Auto Update process should
   run as expected.
