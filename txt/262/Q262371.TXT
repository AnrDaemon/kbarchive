TITLE   :XADM: 2140 and 1002 w. Err. -1008 Starting Directory Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Exchange Server directory service, the following error
message may be displayed:

   Error 2140. Internal Windows NT error.

The following event ID is logged in the Microsoft Windows NT Event Viewer
application event log:

   Event ID: 1002
   Source: MSExchangeDS
   Type: Error
   Category: Internal Processing
   Description:
   The Microsoft Exchange Server database, EDB, could not be initialized and
   returned error -1008. Unrecoverable error. The directory cannot continue.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because many virus protection programs set files to read
only to protect the files. The -1008 error corresponds to
JET_errDatabaseFileReadOnly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, if the database is set to read only, remove the Read Only
attribute from the database and restart the directory service.

You may need to run the eseutil /r /ds command to make the directory consistent.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that file-level virus protection programs exclude the
Exchange Server database and log files. These files should be scanned by an
Exchange Server-aware virus protection product.
