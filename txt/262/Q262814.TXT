STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows 2000 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Devices that communicate as specified by the IEEE 1394 specification can respond
to requests from the computer with a "BusyX" code. In this case, the device is
busy, because of hardware limitations or software interactions in an early
generation of the 1394 chipset.

Support for BusyX retries is defined in the IEEE1394-1995 specification and is
important for successful computer-to-1394 device communications.
