SUMMARY
=======

If you add a cost from 1 through 100 to any Exchange Server connector's Address
Space tab, any messages that use that connector take the new cost into
consideration when e-mail is routed.

Routing cost typically ranges from 1 through 99. The default is 1. If the cost of
a route is set to 1, other routes are used only if that route does not work. If
the cost of a route is set to 100, that route is used only when all other routes
does not work.
