TITLE   :Cannot Start MMS As Either a Service or a Console Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) as a console
application, the \zoomserv\bin\viaserver.initLog may display the following error
message:

   Module cHASHWILDDB's initialize function raised exception ACCESS_VIOLATION at
   address 0x4533c0;
   Call stack:
   0x004533c0 - <unknown>
   0x00000100 - <unknown>
   0x004528e0 - <unknown>
   0x00000018
   Module cHASHWILDDB failed to initialize

When you attempt to start MMS as a service, the following error message may be
displayed on the console:

   Could not start the ZOOMIT Server service on \\<mymachinename>
   Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can be caused by a variety of issues. One confirmed cause of this
behavior is the absence of one or more files (including the Hashcfg file) in the
\zoomserv\data\config directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Hashcfg file is a text file that defines some of the operating parameters of
the hash and hashwild databases. It can be retrieved from any comparable
installation of MMS 2.1 and edited to match the necessary configuration
(regarding hash size, bucket size, hashwild features like ON or OFF, and so on).
It is recommended, however, that the original be restored from the most recent
backup.
