SYMPTOMS
========

When the Host Integration Server 2000 end-user client is installed on a computer
running Windows 95 or Windows 98, the following error message may occur when you
open the Host Account Configuration tool (UDConfig.exe):

   Unable to locate Windows NT Account Synchronization Service in the target
   Windows NT domain. To browse other domains, use the "Select Domain" option of
   the "File" menu.

CAUSE
=====

The end-user UDConfig client cannot locate the Windows NT or Windows 2000 domain
name that contains the master database where the Host Account Cache (HAC)
resides.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the Windows 95 or Windows 98 workgroup name to match the Windows NT or
Windows 2000 domain name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you open the UDConfig tool, it tries to find the location of the master
database. This is the Windows NT or Windows 2000 domain name. When the end-user
client is installed on a computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98, this
information is pulled from the workgroup name that is configured on that
computer.
