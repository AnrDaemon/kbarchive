======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) Windows NT clients may
use the SMSClitoknAcct& account to make network calls during hardware
inventory. This behavior occurs if mapped drives are in the system PATH and the
IBM 100/10 EtherJet PCI adapter driver is installed.

If you disable enumeration of all hardware classes in the SMS_def.mof file, the
problem still occurs.

CAUSE
=====

Hardware inventory runs under the local SMSCliToknAcct& user account, and
calls into Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) under this context. WMI then
uses this account to authenticate any calls it needs to make off the computer.
Because this account exists on all Windows NT SMS clients and has a unique
password on each computer, these network calls cause the account to be locked
out if lockout is enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Swap the IBM 100/10 EtherJet PCI adapter with a new card and driver.

 - Remove the network drive from the system PATH.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Systems
Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
