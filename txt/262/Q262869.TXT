SUMMARY
=======

When you install eithor of the programs listed at the beginning of this article,
you can change the hard disk on which the program is installed, but the hard
disk on which Microsoft Windows is installed needs to have at least 75 megabytes
(MB) of available space.

This space is needed for the update of Microsoft Internet Explorer, the
installation of system files in the Windows\System folder, and the storage of
temporary installation files that are removed when Setup is finished.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends you maintain at least 50 MB of available space on the hard
disk on which Windows is installed. This disk space is needed by the Windows
swap file but may also be used by other programs.
