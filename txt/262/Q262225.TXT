TITLE   :XADM: Unable to Limit Logons When You Use the Exmerge Utility
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Exmerge utility, you must start the information store. This may
cause a problem because you may want to prevent users from accessing their
mailboxes while you run this utility.

One solution that has been posed is to edit the registry to limit users from
logging on to the information store. When you edit the registry, you can allow a
specific account to log on to the Exchange Server computer (such as the Site
Service account) but you cannot run the Exmerge utility.

After you edit the registry and the Exmerge utility attempts to access the
information store to display a list of the users on the local server, you
receive an error message that says the information store cannot be accessed and
that a user with administrator rights to the private information store must be
used.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, log on to the Exchange Server computer as the Site
Service account administrator, start the Exchange Administrator program, and
then disconnect the Exchange Server computer from the network by unplugging the
network cable while you run the Exmerge utility.

Note that when you unplug the Exchange Server computer you may cause a backup in
the queues of the other Exchange Server computers that connect to this server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a limitation of the Exmerge utility.
