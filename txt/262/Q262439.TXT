TITLE   :XADM: Indexes Rebuilt Twice or More After NT Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After an upgrade of Microsoft Windows NT, the Exchange Server database indexes
rebuild themselves more than once.

CAUSE
=====

The rebuilding of the database indexes (or "re-indexing") should only happen
once for each operating system upgrade. However, there are instances in which
the indexing occurs more than once. For example, if the databases are not shut
down gracefully, the re-index event is never flushed to disk; the next time the
services start (such as during a reboot), the database indexes are rebuilt.

WORKAROUND
==========

Shut down all Exchange Server services and restart them. If the databases
re-index themselves, cycle the services again. If the re-indexing occurs again,
contact Microsoft Product Support Services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database determines whether the database
needs to be indexed by checking the current operating system (OS) version
contained in the database header. If the OS version is different than the
current version, ESE indexes the database. This can be retrieved by running
ESEUTIL /MH <full path and name of database>.

Results will be similar to the following:

OS Version: (4.0.1381 SP 5)

If the current version of Windows NT is Service Pack 5 (SP5), an index should not
be required.
