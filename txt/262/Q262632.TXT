TITLE   :Run IIS 5.0/5.1 Instead of PWS on Windows 2000 Professional
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although Personal Web Server (PWS) can be installed separately from the Windows
NT 4.0 Option Pack (NTOP) on computers running Windows NT Workstation 4.0, PWS
does not run on Windows 2000. Instead, you need to install Microsoft Internet
Information Services (IIS) 5.0, which is included in Windows 2000 Professional
and IIS 5.1, which is included in Microsoft Windows XP.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install IIS 5.0 or IIS 5.1, perform the following steps:

1. From the Start menu, click Control Panel, and then click "Add/Remove
   Programs".

2. Select "Add/Remove Windows Components", select the Internet Information
   Services (IIS) component, and then follow the on-screen instructions.

NOTE: IIS 5.0 and 5.1 are not installed by default unless Windows is upgraded
over a previous version of Windows that had PWS installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS has the following limitations:

 - Limited to 10 connections
 - Limited to one Web and one FTP server. In other words, you cannot create
   additional virtual Web or FTP servers.
