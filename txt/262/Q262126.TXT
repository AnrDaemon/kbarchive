TITLE   :XCON: Using Imccopy.exe for Internet Mail Service Message Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Imccopy.exe utility to extract information about the Internet
Mail Service. This article describes how to decode the message formatting
options on the Internet Mail Service by using the output of Imccopy.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Imccopy.exe is located on the Exchange Server CD-ROM in the
Server\Support\Utils\platform folder.

Copy the Imccopy.exe file to drive C, open a command prompt, and at drive C run
the imccopy -save domain imc.txt command. The Imc.txt file is similar to the
following:

   

   [Header]
   Version=1

   [Domain]
   DomainInformation=+
   +Default,ISO-8859-1,ISO-8859-1,800,76,0,0,0
   +microsoft.com,ISO-8859-1,ISO-8859-1,800,76,0,0,0

The Format of the Output
------------------------

This information in the Imc.txt file is divided (by commas) into the fields in
the following table.

   

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Domain   Mime         Non-Mime    Formatting   Word   Send  Unused  Message
         Character    Character   Information  Wrap   Rich          Size
         Set          Set         (See         at     Text          Limit
                                  Following    Column
                                  Table)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Default  ISO-8859-1  ISO-8859-1   800          76     0      0       0
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Table Explanation:

 - Domain. This is the domain for which the options are set. You should always
   have a Default domain, but you may not have any other domains if you have not
   specified any under the Specify by E-Mail Domain option on the Internet Mail
   tab of the Internet Mail Service.

 - Mime Character Set. This is the character set that is specified on the
   Internet Mail tab for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) messages.

 - Non-Mime Character Set. This is the character set that is specified on the
   Internet Mail tab for non-MIME messages.

 - Formatting Information. Decimal representation of a binary number for which
   certain bits set certain formatting options. See the following table for
   information about how to decode these representations.

 - Word Wrap at Column. This field is the "Message text word wrap at column"
   setting (to locate this setting, click "Advanced options" on the Internet
   Mail tab).

 - Send Rich Text. This field is the "Send Microsoft Exchange rich text
   formatting" setting (to locate this setting, click "Advanced options" on the
   Internet Mail tab). This setting has the following three options:

    - 0=User

    - 1=Always

    - 2=Never

 - Message Size Limit. This is the "Maximum message size" setting that is
   specified under "Specify by E-Mail Domain" on the Internet Mail tab of the
   Internet Mail Service. This setting is only valid if you specify the setting
   for each domain. If there is a message size limit specified on the General
   tab of the Internet Mail Service, the message size limit is not included in
   the Imccopy output.

Decoding the Formatting Information
-----------------------------------

Imccopy.exe reports the formatting information as a decimal number. To decode
this information you need to convert the decimal number to a binary number. You
can do this by using the Microsoft Windows Calculator utility.

For example, in the sample output in the beginning of this section, Imccopy
reported that the formatting information is the decimal number 800. If you
convert this to a binary number, it becomes 11 0010 0000. Certain bits in this
binary number represent specific settings.

The following table lists the bits from top to bottom as they appear in the
binary number from right to left (for example, the rightmost bit in the number
corresponds to the first entry in this table).

   Message Content on the Internet Mail tab. The UUENCODE bit must be set to set
   this bit.

 - Disable Out of Office Responses to Internet. This bit is set if you click to
   select the "Disable Out of Office responses to the Internet" check box (to
   locate this setting, click "Advanced options" on the Internet Mail tab).

   setting, click "Advanced options" on the Internet Mail tab).

 - MIME with HTML Only. This bit is set if you click MIME and click to select
   only the HTML check box under Message Content on the Internet Mail tab. If
   this bit is set, the following bits cannot be set: UUENCODE, Binhex, MIME
   with Plain Text Only.
