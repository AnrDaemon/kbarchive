TITLE   :XIMS: Unable to Reach a Particular Host Using Domain Name System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Domain Name System (DNS) or host-name resolution is failing for a particular
domain.

CAUSE
=====

It is possible that DNS is not working or that host-name resolution is failing
due to a firewall or an invalid DNS entry.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, you need to know the IP address of the remote
domain's mail server. After you obtain this information, follow these steps:

1. In the Connections tab of the Internet Mail Connector (IMS) properties, click
   to select "Specify by E-mail Domain".

2. Add an entry for the domain that you are having problems reaching.

3. Click to select "Forward all messages for this domain to host", and then
   enter the IP address of the server that you are trying to contact.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When this problem occurs in Microsoft Windows products, a host file can be used
whereas Exchange Server tries to use DNS first. If the behavior of a host file
is required for Exchange Server, then use the steps in the "Workaround" section
of this article.
