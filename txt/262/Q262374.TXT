TITLE   :XADM: 2140 and 1002 with Error -1811 Error Starting Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Exchange Server directory service, you may receive the
following error message:

   Error 2140. Internal Windows NT error.

The following Event ID is logged in the Microsoft Windows NT Event Viewer
application event log:

   Event ID: 1002
   Source: MSExchangeDS
   Type: Error
   Category: Internal Processing
   Description:
   The Microsoft Exchange Server database, EDB, could not be initialized and
   returned error -1811. Unrecoverable error. The directory cannot continue.

CAUSE
=====

Most virus protection programs have settings to remove, rename or quarantine
infected files as a part of their cleanup process. This issue can occur if the
virus protection program renames the directory.

The -1811 error corresponds to JET_errFileNotFound.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Check your virus protection program to determine its settings.

2. Rename the files to the original file names if they were renamed by the virus
   protection program.

3. Restore the files to their original location if they were deleted or sent to
   a quarantine folder. They may be in the Recycle Bin.

4. If the files were completely deleted from the system, then you must restore
   the files from a backup.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that file-level virus protection programs exclude the
Exchange Server database and log files. Scan these files by using an Exchange
Server-aware virus protection product.
