TITLE   :XFOR: Mail Sent to Windows 2000 Contact from Notes/OL May Loop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent to a mail-enabled Windows 2000 contact for Lotus Notes may start
to loop, and the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes does not detect
it.

CAUSE
=====

The current design of the transport does not generate the appropriate trace
information for the expansion of the distribution list, or for the redirection
of messages. All messages are assumed to be non-looping by the Message Transfer
Agent (MTA).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, place the AllowUnresolvedAddresses=No parameter in
the [LME-GWISE-MEXIN] or [LME-NOTES-MEXIN] section, or place the
AllowUnresolvedAddresses parameter in the registry of the Notes Connector, and
use an asterisk (*) for the address space. A non-delivery report (NDR) should
then be generated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server.
