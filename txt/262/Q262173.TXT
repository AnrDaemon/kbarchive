The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A memory leak may occur when the Internet Information Server (IIS) Log component
(IISLog) is repeatedly instantiated. The amount of memory loss that occurs is
directly related to the number of times that the IIS Log Component is
instantiated.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there are Active Template Library (ATL) macros
calling the SysAllocString function with no corresponding the SysFreeString
function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Services
version 5.0.
