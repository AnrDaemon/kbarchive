SYMPTOMS
========

After you demote a Windows 2000 Server-based Exchange Server computer from a
domain controller and re-promote that computer to a domain controller, the
Internet Mail Service may not start during the last step of the Internet Mail
Service Wizard. The following error message may be displayed:

   The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely
   fashion.

   ID no: 0xc002041d

The following event may be logged in the Windows 2000 Event Viewer:

   Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Category: Initialization/Termination
   Unable to start the Internet Mail Connector service because MAPI could not be
   initialized.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the group membership of the local users changes after
the computer is re-promoted to a domain controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. In the Active Directory Users and Computers Microsoft Management Console
   (MMC) snap-in, click the Users container, and then double-click the service
   account user.

2. Click the "Member of" tab.

3. Make sure that the service account is a member of the Domain Administrators
   group.

4. If the service account is member of the Domain Users group only, click Add,
   and then add the Domain Administrators group to the membership list.
