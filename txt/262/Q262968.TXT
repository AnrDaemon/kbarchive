NOTE: In the following example, the Address Book view is grouped by company
name.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in Raw mode, click
   the DL, and then click Raw Properties on the File menu.

2. In the "List of attribute type" box, click All.

3. Click the attribute that you are want to group the Address Book view by in
   the Object attributes box (in this case Company).

4. Type the attribute in the Edit Value box (in this case, the name of the
   company).

5. Click the Set button.

6. Click the Apply button, and then click OK.

Follow this procedure for every DL object that you want to view in the Address
Book view.

Method Two
----------

If you have a large number of DLs, use the Directory Export feature in the
Administrator program to export the file so that you can edit it, and then
import the file back to the Administrator program:

1. Start the Administrator program.

2. On the Tools menu, click Directory Export.

3. Click the name of your Exchange Server computer in the MS Exchange Server
   box.

4. Click All in the Home server box.

7. Click to select the Include sub-containers option (if you have subfolders).

8. Click to clear Mailbox, and then click to select Distribution list.

9. Click the Export button.

Next, edit the Dl.csv file by using Microsoft Excel:

1. Start Excel, and then open the Dl.csv file.

2. Click column G, and then click Columns on the Insert menu.

3. In row one of the column that you created, type the attribute that you want
   to group the Address Book view by (for example, "company" (without the
   quotation marks)).

4. In every row in the column, add the proper value for the attribute for each
   DL that you want to include in the Address Book view.

5. Add a row in column B, name it "Mode," and then add a Create value in every
   row of the Mode column.

6. Add a row, name it "Object-Class", and then add a value of 0 in every row.

7. Save the Dl.csv file.

Next, use the Administrator program to import the edited Dl.csv file:

1. Start the Administrator program.

2. On the Tools menu, click Directory Export.

3. Click the name of your Exchange Server computer in the MS Exchange Server
   box.

4. Click the Container button, and then enter your site recipient container.
