TITLE   :Name Change of an IIS 5.0 Application Restarts the Application
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the name of an application in Internet information Services 5.0 causes
the application to restart. This can cause problems for users that are currently
using the application.

CAUSE
=====

When the application is renamed, all users currently logged on to the
application are effected because the URL is changed.

WORKAROUND
==========

In order for the name change to be "graceful," restarting the application itself
(thereby purging the cache, and so on) seems to be the best way to address this
issue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.

Additional query words: iis
