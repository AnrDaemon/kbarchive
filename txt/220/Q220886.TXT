======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Connected SNA Server Clients do not show up in License Manager when the SNA
Server has been be configured for "Per Server" mode. This does not affect SNA
Servers configured for "Per Seat" mode.

CAUSE
=====

In "Per Seat" mode, when a new client connects, SNA Server calls the Windows NT
License API, NtLicenseRequest(), and when a client disconnects, the
NtLSFreeHandle() is called. When SNA Server is configured for "Per Server" mode,
at startup it reads the number of licenses from the registry and, then SNA
Server enforces this number. In this mode, SNA Server will never call the
Windows NT License APIs.

SNA Server has now been changed to call the Windows NT License APIs when running
in "Per Server" mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

SP2, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server
version 4.0 Service Pack 3.
