TITLE   :PRB: GETPRINTER()  Behaves Differently Based on Machine's OS
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWinNT kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600 kbOSWin95 kbOSWin98 kbXBase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The GETPRINTERS() function produces both a different dialog and different
results when querying printers from a machine running Windows 95 or 98 as
opposed to Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, use the APRINTERS() function to store the available printers
into an array. Also, if you want to choose the printer when running a report,
add the PROMPT clause to the REPORT FORM command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual FoxPro 6.0 or 5.0 on a Windows NT 4.0 machine.

2. In the Command window, type:

   ? GETPRINTER()

3. Expand the drop-down list and note the values that appear next to the Name,
   Type, and Where labels in the dialog box.

4. Perform the steps above on a Windows 95 or 98 machine.

5. On the Windows NT machine, the Name drop-down box contains the address of the
   printer if the printer is on a network. Therefore, the GETPRINTER() function
   returns the printer's network address, if the printer is on a network. The
   Type label lists the actual printer name. If it is a local printer, they are
   the same. The Where label has a number and the word PASSTHRU.

   On Windows 95 or 98, the Name drop-down box contains the name of the printer.
   Therefore, GETPRINTERS() returns the name of the printer and not its network
   address under Windows 95 or 98. The Type label also has the name of the
   printer. The Where label has the network address. If the printer is local,
   Name and Type are the same.
