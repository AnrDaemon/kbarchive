TITLE   :XADM: Removed Mailbox Cleanup Agent Remains in Mailbox Resources
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Mailbox Cleanup Agent remains as an entry in the private information store
Mailbox Resources after the Mailbox Cleanup Agent has been removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Mailbox Cleanup Agent can be installed in any of the following containers:

 - Configuration

 - Add-Ins

 - Addressing

 - Address-Templates

 - Address-Types

 - Display-Templates

 - Connections

 - Dir-Repl

 - Monitors

 - Recipients

If the Mailbox Cleanup Agent was installed in a Recipients container, you can
remove the mailbox resource. To remove the entry from the private information
store Mailbox Resources:

1. Create a mailbox in the same Recipients container that the Mailbox Cleanup
   Agent was installed in.

2. In the Alias box, type "MSExchangeMCA" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the other boxes, type any applicable information that you want to.

4. After you create the mailbox, you can delete it, and then the mailbox
   resource for the Mailbox Cleanup Agent is deleted as well.

When you create this mailbox you create an object that has the same Distinguished
Name (DN) as the Mailbox Cleanup Agent mailbox resource.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.
