MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Archive an entire database either by using the Archive Wizard or by using the
   SSARC command.

2. Create a new database using the Visual SourceSafe Administrator. From the
   Tools menu, click Create Database.

3. Open the newly created database by clicking the Users menu, and selecting
   Open SourceSafe Database. Click the Browse button to find the Srcsafe.ini
   file.

4. Once the new database appears in the list of available databases, make sure
   the database name and path are selected and click Open. You may get the
   following warning after clicking Open:

   The Admin user currently has no SourceSafe password. Therefore, any user can
   run the Administrator's program. To secure this program, give the Admin user
   a password.

   Click OK.

5. From the Archive menu, click Restore Projects.

6. In Step 1 of the Restore Wizard, browse for the archive file (.ssa) created
   in Step 1 of this article. Click Next. You many get the following warning

   restored.

   Click OK. This dialog box will appear if you are restoring to a different
   database than you archived from.

   "Display subprojects" check box.
