The VSSAddin.exe sample program implements automatic notification of Visual
SourceSafe events to specified individuals. This sample program demonstrates how
to create a Control Panel application that is integrated with a Visual
SourceSafe add-in.

Install the VSSAddin Program Files
----------------------------------

VSSAddin.exe is a self-extracting executable file; double-click it and the file
extracts two folders, SSAddin and VSSCtlApp.

The sample program consists of three projects:

 - A Control Panel application (VSSCtlApp.dsw) that allows an Administrator to
   specify which events to send notification of, as well as the email and pager
   address information of the individuals to notify. This application writes the
   entered information to a file on the Visual SourceSafe server.

 - A Visual SourceSafe add-in (SSaddin.dsw) that reads the entered information
   from the Visual SourceSafe server, handles the specified events, and sends
   notification to the specified recipients.

 - A third project (VSSAddin.dsw) that creates the DLL that holds the icon for
   the Control Panel application.

Build the Control Panel Application
-----------------------------------

1. In Microsoft Visual C++, browse to the VSSCtlApp folder and open the
   VSSCtlApp.dsw project.

2. Open the MyDialog.cpp file and change the blank path on line 32 to the
   universal naming convention (UNC) path of the file to create on the Visual
   SourceSafe server. This path should resemble the following:

   

   \\\\Server\\Share\\Ssaddin.dat

3. Save the MyDialog.cpp file, and then press F7 to create the VSSCtlApp.cpl
   file.

Build the Visual SourceSafe Add-in
----------------------------------

1. Browse to the SSAddin folder and open the Ssaddin.dsw project.

2. Open the Ssaddin.cpp file. Change the blank path on line 35 to point to the
   same file that you specified in the Control Panel application.

3. Change the blank profile and password on lines 50 and 51 to be a valid
   Microsoft Exchange profile and password.

4. Save the Ssaddin.cpp file, and then press F7 to create the Ssaddin.dll file.

Build the VSSAddin DLL
----------------------

1. Browse to the VSSCtlApp\VSSAddin folder and open the VSSAddin.dsw project.

2. Press F7 to create the VSSAddin.dll file.

Configure and Run the Application
---------------------------------

1. Copy the VSSAddin.dll and VSSCtlApp.cpl files into the %SystemRoot%\System32
   folder.

2. From a command prompt, register Ssaddin.dll with the following command:

   "RegSvr32 ssaddin.dll" (without the quotation marks)

3. Create a file named Ssaddin.ini in the VSS\Win32 folder where the Ssapi.dll
   file is registered (in other words, the folder where you installed Visual
   SourceSafe). This folder should also be the folder that the following
   registry key points to:

   

  
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SourceSafe\SCCServerPath

4. Open the Ssaddin.ini file and add the following line to it:

   "SSAddIn.0=1" (without the quotation marks)

5. Open Control Panel and start the VSSAddin application.

6. Specify an event and the email address of someone to notify.

7. Quit the VSSAddin application. There should now be a file with the name you
   specified in the Control Panel application and Visual SourceSafe add-in
   projects.

8. Open Visual SourceSafe and make the specified event occur. The email address
   that you specified should receive an email stating that the event occurred.
