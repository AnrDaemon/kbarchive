-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the unattended Setup program is used to install the SNA Server software in an
environment with multiple domains, it may be necessary to specify the
ServerLoginDomain parameter in the Snasetup.ini file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If SNA Server is located in a resource domain, the ServerLoginDomain name should
be the name of the master domain and not the name of the resource domain where
SNA Server is actually located. The ServerUserId parameter should be set to
reflect the user account in the domain specified by ServerLoginDomain. If the
ServerLoginDomain paramater is set to be the name of the resource domain where
SNA Server is located, the Setup program will not be able to locate the UserId
specified in the ServerUserId parameter, and the installation will not complete
successfully.

REFERENCES
==========

Additional information about automating SNA Server installations may be found in
the on-line SNA Server Getting Started documentation.
