SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to use the Visual Basic Application Wizard in Visual Basic 6.0
Learning Edition, you receive the following message:

   You do not have the proper license to load the VB 98 Application Wizard. You
   must have the Learning, Professional, or Enterprise edition of Visual Basic
   installed.

This problem only occurs when both the Visual Basic 6.0 Learning Edition and the
Visual Basic 5.0 Control Creation Edition are installed on the same system.

Microsoft has created the following application that allows you to switch back
and forth between the Visual Basic 5.0 CCE and the Visual Basic 6.0 Learning
Editions. The following files are available for download from the Microsoft
Download Center:
