TITLE   :Err Msg: A Connection with the Server Could Not be Established
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open http://localhost or the product documentation using
Internet Explorer on a computer running Internet Information Server (IIS)
versions 4.0 or 5.0, one of the following error messages occurs:

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site http://localhost/.
   A connection with the server could not be established

   OR

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site
   http://localhost/iisHelp/iis/misc/default.asp.
   A connection with the server could not be established

CAUSE
=====

The default Web site has been assigned to use a particular IP address.

This change may modify or even prevent proper access to some of the functionality
that a standard IIS installation makes available through the default (All
Unassigned) setting. This change may also disable additional functionality that
depends on the IIS default setting.

The IIS default setting permits proper access to the default Web site through the
locally predefined resolution of the host name "localhost". Whenever TCP/IP is
installed, "localhost" is associated with the IP address 127.0.0.1, as defined
from within the %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\HOSTS file (for Microsoft
Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 2000), or the %windir%\HOSTS file (for
Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98). However, changing the
association to this file is not enough to permit proper access to the default
Web site.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the default Web site to use (All Unassigned) IP addresses. To do this,
perform the following steps:

1. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
   Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Right-click the default Web site folder, and then click Properties.

3. On the Web Site tab, click the IP Address drop-down list box, and then click
   (All Unassigned).

4. Click OK.
