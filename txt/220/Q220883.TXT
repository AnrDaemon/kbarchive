SYMPTOMS

Calling GetSecurityInfo() to retrieve a copy of the security descriptor for a
registry key handle fails with the following error:

   ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER

This problem will occur only when hParent points to HKEY_CURRENT_USER and
pszSubKeyName is any subkey name created using Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER. There are no issues with other registry handles.
