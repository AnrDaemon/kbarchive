TITLE   :Problems Using a Non-US WinNT Workstation w/ US Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a non-U.S. version of Windows NT Workstation 4.0 to
connect the U.S. version of the Terminal Server client or to a U.S. version of
Terminal Server, you may get an error message. This error message has been seen
with the Korean version of Windows NT, but could occur with others. The error
message is as follows:

   Keyboard layout of requested language could not be opened.
   Korean keyboard layout will be used instead.
   You can choose another layout from your CLIENT SETTINGS.

Other symptoms may include the loss of functionality of the keyboard after you
have logged on to the Terminal Server client on the Windows NT Workstation
computer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the appropriate code pages are not installed on the
Terminal Server computer or the Terminal Server client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, install the non-U.S. code pages on the Terminal
Server computer and install the U.S. code pages on the Windows NT Workstation
computer.
