TITLE   :Undocumented COMTI Methods Are Exposed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) component has been successfully
registered with Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), you can see two additional
interface methods when you view the COMTI object methods within the MTS
adminstration tool. The two methods are ServerPid() and LastSM(). These methods
are not intended to be used by developers and are unsupported.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Interface Definition Language (IDL) infomation below depicts the built-in
properties that are inherited for all COMTI objects.

   / 
   [id(0x7fffffff), propget, hidden]
   long ServerPID();

   [id(0x7ffffffe), propget, hidden]
   long LastSM();

   [id(0x7ffffffd), propget, helpstring("Current status of the remote environment")]
   BSTR REStatus();

   [id(0x7ffffffc), propget, helpstring("Build a new Recordset object")]
   IDispatch *NewRecordset(BSTR name);

   //[id(0x7ffffffb), propget, helpstring("Explicit selection of the remote RE")]
   //BSTR CurrentRE();

   [id(0x7ffffffb), propput]
   void SelectionHint(BSTR rhs);

   //[id(0x7ffffffa), propget, helpstring("Collection of compatible REs")]
   //IUnknown *RECollection();

The two undocumented functions have an associated "hidden" attribute and should
not be displayed in most object browsers. However, certain object browsers may
disregard the attribute and display the properties anyway.
