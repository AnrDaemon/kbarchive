TITLE   :SMS: Error Message When Using Healthmon on a Secondary Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMMC kbSecurity kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbNetMon kbsmsUtil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Healthmon tool that is installed on a Microsoft
Systems Management Server 2.0-based secondary site, the following error message
may be displayed:

   Unable to detect (Please refer to the release notes): SMS_SQL_Monitor

Although the release notes state that the SMS_SQL_Monitor service must be
installed, this does not apply to secondary sites. Secondary sites do not own
their own database, so the SMS_SQL_Monitor service is not installed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Healthmon tool does not distinguish between
Systems Management Server 2.0 primary and secondary sites.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can find the console or agent for the Healthmon tool in the following folder
on the Systems Management Server 2.0 CD-ROM:

   <drive>\Healthmon\<platform>\00000409

where <drive> is the drive letter and <platform> is the platform type
of your computer.

Computers that have been upgraded to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) 1.5
or Microsoft Windows 2000-based computers do not have the WMI 1.1 tool
(Wbemperm.exe).

NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 users which have WMI 1.5 installed, also need to install the
Microsoft Security Configuration Editor (SCE), included on the Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4 (SP4) (and later) CD-ROM. On Windows NT-based computers, the tool
is Wbemcntl.exe. The Microsoft SCE is required to edit the Access Control Lists
(ACLs) on the Windows Installer (WI) namespaces.
