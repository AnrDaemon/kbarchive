-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Visual FoxPro (Build 6.00.8281.00), version 6.0 
 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Visual FoxPro, versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, when Visual FoxPro tables that are accessed by using the Visual
FoxPro ODBC driver from a Web page, files with the .tmp extension are created in
the Microsoft Windows NT System32 or the Microsoft Windows 9x System
sub-directory on the server. This is usually not the desired directory for these
files. In order to control this behavior, the System temp environment variable
needs to be set on the Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set the System temp environment variable, do the following:

1. On your computer desktop, right-click on My Computer.

2. Choose Properties and select the Environment tab.

3. Click an entry in the System Variables list box (the one on top).

4. In the Variable and Value Edit control, type the following:

" Variable = TEMP
Value = C:\Temp" (without the quotation marks)

5. Click the Set button, and note that TEMP has been added to the list of system
   variables. Repeat the process for the TMP variable.

6. Log off and restart the computer.
