======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use ADO with the OLE/DB Provider for DB2 and stored procedures, it is
not possible to control the COMMIT or ROLLBACK commands in a transaction. For
example, the following code does not work to commit or rollback a transaction:

   Set objConn = New ADODB.Connection
   objConn.BeginTrans
   ; Call stored procedures here
   If OK then
   	objConn.CommitTrans
   ELSE
   	objConn.RollbackTrans
   End IF
   Set objConn = Nothing

NOTE: The OLE/DB for DB2 Provider support for stored procedures was added in
Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 3.

CAUSE
=====

The OLE/DB Provider for DB2 is incorrectly performing the commitment of the
transaction.
