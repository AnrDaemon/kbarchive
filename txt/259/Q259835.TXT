The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft StarLancer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft StarLancer, you may receive a warning message stating
that your computer is running at a speed slower than 233 MHz.

If you complete the installation of StarLancer, you may experience any of the
following symptoms:

 - Graphics performance in the game may be extremely poor.

 - The screen may be distorted, and the program may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a Cyrix 6x86MX microprocessor (CPU) with a Processor
Performance rating (P-rating) of 300 or lower is installed in your computer.

Cyrix microprocessors are labelled with a Processor Performance rating that is
faster than the internal clock speed at which the chip operates. The Cyrix
6x86MX 300 microprocessor operates at an internal clock speed of 233 MHz.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install a faster microprocessor in your computer.
