SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Microsoft Novell NetWare-compatible client such as GSNW, CSNW,
Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
Services, and MSNDS, you may be unable to log on to Novell NetWare 5.x-based
servers, and you may receive one or more of the following error messages:

   Error: You cannot be authenticated on <tree><context> due to the
   following reason: The network path was not found.

   Error: You are not logged in to the directory tree <tree name>.

   Error: An unexplained error occurred while your computer tried to access the
   network. For more information, contact your network administrator.

   Error: Failed to authenticate to server <server name>, attempting to
   connect bindery FFFFFD88 -632 error

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if your NetWare account was created or your password was
set from a Novell NetWare version 3.2 or 4.7 client. Because of a change in the
authentication process of the NetWare version 3.2 or 4.7 clients, non-Novell
clients can experience this issue.
