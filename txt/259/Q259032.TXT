SUMMARY
=======

Attribute flow is utilized in Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) to flow
attributes between the connector space, the hologram, and the metaverse.
Attribute flow scripts have five vectors available. These vectors provide MMS
with the ability to co-manage attributes from different source directories to a
single joined metaverse object.

The following list contains the five vectors that are available in attribute flow
scripts:

 - CD: Used to specify the Connected Directory.

 - CSP: Used to specify the potential value for the Connector Space built by the
   connector space construction template.

 - MVP: Used to specify the potential value for the metaverse built by the
   metaverse construction template.

 - CS: Used to specify the Connector Space.

 - MV: Used to specify the metaverse.

Also, there are four kinds of assignments available in the attribute flow
scripts:

    
     =    This assignment replaces the attribute.
    +=    This assignment appends additional values to a multivalued attribute.
    -=    This assignment removes a specific value from the attribute.
    <<    This assignment merges all values in one multivalued attribute.  

MORE INFORMATION
================

These operators are especially important for managing multivalued attribute
ownership, for example:

John Doe's $mv.colors has 4 values:

 - Purple

 - Red

 - Orange

 - Green

John Doe's $cd.colors has 3 values:

 - Blue

 - Yellow

 - Purple
