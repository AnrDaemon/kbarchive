======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you link a collection to another collection in the Systems Management
Server (SMS) Administrator console, there may be a long delay before the
populated Browse Collection window appears.

CAUSE
=====

The Administrator console uses a complex set of queries to populate the Browse
Collection window. It may take a long time to populate the window on a site with
many collections.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

version 2.0 SP2.
