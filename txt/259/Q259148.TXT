SYMPTOMS
========

Under stress, Microsoft Exchange or other programs may stop working and may
generate Dr. Watson error messages ("Access violation").

If symbols are installed, the stack traces in the Dr. Watson log show that the
problem occurs near the EnumProtocolsW function. The stack traces may vary in
different situations. Two sample stack traces are listed here:

   *----> Stack Back Trace <----*
   ReturnAd Param#1  Param#2  Param#3  Param#4  Function Name

CAUSE
=====

The EnumProtocols function in Windows Sockets (Mswsock.dll) is calculating a
buffer length incorrectly, resulting in heap corruption.
