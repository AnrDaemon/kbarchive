The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) 2.0, Telnet server connections are limited to
the number of connections defined in License Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are defining the number of sessions allowed by Telnet server, you
cannot set a number larger than the number of licenses defined in Microsoft
Windows 2000/Microsoft Windows NT License Manager. To define a Telnet server
session limit, start Services for UNIX Administrator, and then double-click
Telnet Server, Server Settings, and "Maximum number of simultaneous
connections".

The maximum number of sessions allowed is equal to the License value set in
License Manager. If the License Manager value is higher than 63, the default
value for the "Maximum number of simultaneous connections" setting is 63.
