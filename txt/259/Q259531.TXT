SUMMARY
=======

You can use Internet Mail Service to relay mail for multiple Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) domains and their associated subdomains to a specific
smart host.

This option is made easier by the default routing property of Internet Mail
Service to accept all mail for a domain unless the domain is explicitly
designated by using a number sign (#) before the main domain. For example, an
inbound domain of #microsoft.com only accepts mail for the microsoft.com domain,
whereas microsoft.com accepts mail for all domains in the namespace of
microsoft.com.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure SMTP relay for domains and subdomains, use the following steps:

1. Open Internet Mail Service properties.

2. On the Connection tab, click E-Mail Domain, and then click Add.

3. In the E-mail Domain field, type the namespace for the domain to be relayed.

   NOTE: By default, all subdomains are also relayed.

4. Click "Forward all messages for this domain to host", type the fully
   qualified domain name (FQDN) or the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the
   target host, and then click OK.

5. On the Routing tab, click "Reroute incoming SMTP mail", and then click Add.

6. In the "E-Mail sent to this domain" field, type the namespace for the domain
   that needs to be relayed.

7. Click "Override relay restrictions. Always relay.", and then click OK.

8. Restart Internet Mail Service when you are prompted to do so.
