TITLE   :Program Receives "File Is Corrupt or Unreadable" Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWin2000PreSP1Fix kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a multiple-processor computer with two or more programs that access the same
files by using the CreateFile (or another) file function, one of the programs
may receive a STATUS_FILE_CORRUPT_ERROR response and generate an error message
similar to:

   FILE.TXT -- Corrupt File
   The file or directory \dir\temp is corrupt and unreadable, please run the
   Chkdsk utility.

However, when you run Chkdsk.exe, no file corruption is found.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a timing issue in the NTFS file system when both
programs attempt to access the same file at the same time. This timing problem
causes a STATUS_FILE_CORRUPT_ERROR response to be returned erroneously to one of
the programs.
