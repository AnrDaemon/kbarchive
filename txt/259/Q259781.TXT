   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based server running Systems
Management Server (SMS) 2.0 site server to Microsoft Windows 2000, the
permissions on the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive of the registry are reset to a
default setting. This default setting includes removing access for individual
accounts that have been granted specific permissions. This can affect the
ability of remote SMS site system computers to connect to the site server.

Services and/or processes on remote site computers (such as Inbox Manager
Assistant on Client Access Point (CAP) servers and the SMS_SQL_Monitor service
on remote SQL Server) use the SMS Server Connection Account,
SMSServer_<xxx> (where <xxx> is the site code) to connect to the
site server. When the registry permissions are reset during the site server
upgrade to Windows 2000, the explicit permissions that the SMSServer_<xxx>
account has been granted to the registry of the site server are removed. This
results in the inability of this account to connect and can cause slow
processing of or possibly failures in:

 - Collection updates
 - Hierarchy updates
 - Software distributions
 - Other failures

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the Windows 2000 upgrade program resets some
registry permissions to default under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive as part of the
enhanced security features in Windows 2000. Because of this, any custom
permissions that were added to the registry (such as the SMSServer_<xxx>
account by SMS) are removed.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, manually add the permissions to the registry of the
site server using the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Machine value under the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers\winreg\AllowedPaths

3. On the Edit menu, click Multi String, add "Software\Microsoft\SMS" (without
   the quotation marks) to the existing data, and then click OK.

4. Locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Inbox Source

5. On the Security menu, click Permissions, and then click Add.

6. Click the SMSServer_<xxx> account from the list of objects in the
   domain, click Add, click OK, grant the SMSServer_<xxx> account Full
   Control permissions, and then click OK.

7. Quit Registry Editor.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
