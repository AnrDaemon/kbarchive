KEYWORDS:kbWin2000SP2Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

HTTP compression allows Internet Information Services (IIS) to send compressed
content to the browser when the following conditions are true:

 - The HTTP request is issued by a compression-enabled browser.

 - HTTP Compression is enabled on the IIS server for static and/or dynamic
   content.

 - The request is an HTTP GET request.

Even when you enable HTTP Compression, POST responses are not compressed.

CAUSE
=====

This is a design limitation in IIS 5.0. A fix has been developed to enable HTTP
Compression on POST requests. See the "Resolution" section for more information.
