======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you advertise a program to a collection, some clients in your site may not
report a status message stating whether the program was run successfully even
though each client ran the program successfully and each component reported a
status message (.svf file).

Another symptom is the loss of any file encapsulated in a Replication Manager
(.rpl) file.

CAUSE
=====

Replication Manager discards some .rpl files when the target component is not
active. For example, status summaries received by a site in which the
summarizers are disabled are deleted. This behavior is recorded in the
Replication Manager log file (Replmgr.log) by the following entry:

   Component <name> is not active, throw away replication file.

Each deleted file is kept in a list and the list is not properly cleared. When
Replication Manager deletes the files stored in the list, any new file created
with a name already stored in the list can then be deleted.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
