 - The printer is configured to use the HP Color LaserJet 8500N PostScript (PS)
   printer driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure the printer to use the HP Color LaserJet 8500
Printer Control Language (PCL) printer driver when you want to print from
Expedia Streets and Trips 2000.

If the HP Color LaserJet 8500N PCL printer driver is not installed on your
computer, download and install the printer driver from the following
Hewlett-Packard Web site:

If the issue continues to occur after you install the PCL printer driver, change
both of the timeout settings to 60 seconds, and disable bidirectional printing.

For additional information, please refer to the printed documentation provided
with your printer or contact your printer manufacturer.
