TITLE   :MAPI Exchange Management Agent/Discovery Takes a Long Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MAPI Exchange management agent's discovery of Microsoft Exchange mailboxes
may take a long time and a lot of resources.

CAUSE
=====

There are two problems involved in this issue:

 - When the management agent is discovering the Assoc-NT-Account attribute from
   Exchange, the Exchange server contacts the primary domain controller to
   verify the value.

 - When you perform a container discovery of Exchange with a release prior to
   MMS 2.1, the management agent discovers the entire site and then discards
   everything but the containers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that you are running Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) 2.1 or
later. If the management agent continues to be slow, you may want to remove
Assoc-NT-Account from the list of attributes to discover:

1. Click the Exchange management agent.

2. click Configure MA.

3. Click the Connected Directory Specifics tab.

4. Click the Attributes To Discover tab.

5. In the "Exchange Mailbox attributes to discover" section, remove the
   Assoc-NT-Account attribute from the list.

NOTE: Before you remove this attribute, make sure that it is not a required
attribute for your directory project.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
