======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Novell ZEN Works, Intel LAN Desk, or the Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2
client was previously installed on another partition, remote control in SMS 2.0
can result in unpredictable behavior. This behavior can include a loss of Gold
Key functionality, an abruptly closed remote control session, or a general
protection (GP) fault at the Administrator console.

CAUSE
=====

A previous version of the Kbstuff.sys or Rchelp.sys file may exist in another
folder or partition on the client.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the previous version of the Kbstuff.sys or Rchelp.sys file before
installing the SMS 2.0 client to prevent this issue. If the issue occurs, remove
the drivers from the partition on which SMS is not installed, and reinstall the
Remote Tools component.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMS 2.0 installation of remote control functionality depends on the
installation of several low-level drivers. Two of these are the Kbstuff.sys or
Rchelp.sys files. These files may also be installed by other management
programs. If either the Kbstuff.sys or Rchelp.sys file is installed by another
management program on a different partition, SMS 2.0 cannot detect the versions
of these other drivers. This creates a driver conflict when SMS successfully
installs the new versions of the drivers on a different partition. The
Remctrl.log file in the SMS 2.0 client logs folder reports the installation as
successful. However, the conflict between the drivers creates instability when
the drivers are accessed through remote control.
