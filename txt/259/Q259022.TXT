PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you log on to a Microsoft Exchange Client by using the Exchange Server
service account, you can open and view the mailbox of any user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. By default, the Exchange Server service account
inherits permissions for every mailbox. The service account is automatically
granted the role of Service Account Administrator, which includes Mailbox Owner
rights.

Any other account that has been granted the role of Service Account Administrator
also has Mailbox Owner rights, which allows those users to log on to every
mailbox on the system.

Because of these capabilities, it is important for Exchange Server administrators
to safeguard the Exchange Server service account and password.
