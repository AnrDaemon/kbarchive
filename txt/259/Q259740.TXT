TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Prompts for User's Credentials
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to remote control a Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
Windows NT client, the following dialog box may appear:

   Credentials Required

   The currently logged-in user does not have rights to access the client
   machine. You must provide the username, domain, and password of an account in
   the client's remote control operators group.

The Permitted Viewer list is correct and has been verified against another
working SMS client computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Microsoft Windows NT LAN Manager (LM) Security
Support Provider Service is not enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Using a remote connection, connect to the client computer through Server
   Manager.

2. Start the Windows NT LM Security Support Provider Service, and then set the
   service to automatic.

3. Stop, and then restart the SMS Remote Control Agent service.
