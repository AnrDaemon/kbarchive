The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft StarLancer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft StarLancer, your video adapter may not be detected as a
Direct3D-compatible device. As a result, 3D Render Mode is configured to use the
Software Renderer when you play the game.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following video adapters are installed in
your computer:

 - Matrox MGA Mystique

 - Matrox Millennium II AGP PowerDesk

 - S3 ViRGE PCI 325

These video adapters do not support all of the Direct3D features that are
required by StarLancer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior has also been reported with video adapters based on the S3 ViRGE
Vx/Dx/Gx chip sets.
