TITLE   :XWEB: Outlook Web Access Error Replying or Forwarding Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to reply to or forward e-mail messages, the
following error message may be displayed:

   Failed to open item, your item does not exist in this folder. It may have
   been deleted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if Active Server Pages (ASP) pages are corrupted or
missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove and reinstall Outlook Web Access:

NOTE: These steps assume that Autorun for the CD-ROM drive is turned on. If
Autorun is not turned on for the CD-ROM drive, run Setup.exe from Windows
Explorer, and then go to step 4 of the following steps.

1. Insert the Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 CD-ROM.

2. Click "Setup Server and Components".

3. Click "Microsoft Exchange Server Setup".

4. Click Add/Remove.

5. Clear Outlook Web Access, and then click Continue.

6. When you are prompted with Are you sure you want to remove this item?, click
   Yes.

7. After Setup finishes, rename the Exchsrvr\Webdata folder.

8. Insert the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM again, and click "Setup Server and
   Components".

9. Click "Microsoft Exchange Server Setup".

10. Click Add/Remove, select Outlook Web Access, and then click Continue.

11. Complete the installation of Outlook Web Access.

12. Install the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack.

Another resolution to this issue is to re-register the Cdo.dll and Cdohtml.dll
files. To do so, run the Regsvr32.exe program after you install OWA. This
utility resets the affected registry settings by reregistering the Cdo.dll
file:

1. At the command prompt, run Regsvr32.exe. Use the full path to the Cdo.dll
   file.

2. At the command prompt, run Regsvr32.exe. Use the full path to the Cdohtml.dll
   file.
