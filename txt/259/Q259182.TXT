PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you set up an Outlook Address Book that uses a contacts public folder as a
source, if a user opens the Address Book and selects a contacts address book
from the list of Outlook Address Books, the following error message is
displayed:

   An internal support function returned an error.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the user does not have Read permissions for the contacts
folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, grant the user Read permissions for the contacts folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although public folders are visible by default, not all users have Read rights
for all folders. Outlook allows you to set up a contacts folder as an address
book if it is visible, but when a user who does not have Read rights to the
folder tries to gain access to the folder, the error message in the "Symptoms"
section of this article is displayed.
