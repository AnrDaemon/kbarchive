TITLE   :Error Message Connecting to Your MMS Server by an HTTP Port
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "http://<localhost>" or "http://MMSservername" syntax to
connect to your metadirectory in Microsoft Internet Explorer, you may receive
one of the following error messages.

In Internet Explorer 5:

   The page cannot be displayed

In Internet Explorer 4.01:

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site Http://MMSservername/.
   A connection with the server could not be established.

CAUSE
=====

Your Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) server is configured to use an HTTP
port other than port 80. MMS HTTP and LDP ports are configurable and you can
modify them from their defaults. The default port for HTTP is port 80 and for
LDP is port 389.

This problem can occur if you install MMS on a domain controller that is running
Microsoft Windows 2000 or on the same member server as another program that is
already using the port (for example, Microsoft Exchange Server). When you
install MMS on a Windows 2000-based domain controller, the HTTP port must be
modified to a port other than port 80. For additional information, click the

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following syntax to connect to the metadirectory
by using an alternative HTTP port:

 - http://<localhost>:<port>

 - http://<MMSservername>:<port>

MORE INFORMATION
================

Generally, for performance reasons, Microsoft does not recommend running MMS on
a domain controller. For additional information about performance
