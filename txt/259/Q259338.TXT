TITLE   :XCLN: Private Meeting Requests Are Not Forwarded to Delegate
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Outlook delegate that is configured to receive meeting requests from the
mailbox owner does not receive meeting requests that are marked with a "private"
sensitivity.

CAUSE
=====

When you click the "Delegate receives copies of meeting-related messages sent to
me" check box, or the "Send meeting requests and responses only to my delegates,
not to me" check box, the Forward Meeting Request rule that is created to
forward these messages is designed to not forward private meetings.

WORKAROUND
==========

To ensure that the delegate receives all meetings requests, do not mark these
meetings with a "private" sensitivity.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Outlook 2000, a delegate can view private items in the mailbox owner's
calendar if the "Delegate can see my private items" check box is selected. To
select this option, click Options on the Tools menu, and then click the
Delegates tab.

The "Delegate can see my private items" option is a new feature in Outlook 2000.
It does not include meeting requests that are marked as private. For additional
