SUMMARY
=======

If you have a 2-tier client/server application (for example, a Visual Basic
desktop client application that connects to SQL Server), should you apply for
the Client Logo, Server Logo, or both?

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the client workstation manipulates the data and requires little involvement
from the server, other than SQL Server and some SQL stored procedures, then the
application is considered to be a "Desktop" or Windows 2000 Professional
application.

To qualify for the Server Logo, there needs to be a clear server-side aspect to
the application; for example, an Active Server Page (ASP) that collects data
from a Web-based form where data is sent from the client to be processed on the
server.
