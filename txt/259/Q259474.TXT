SYMPTOMS
========

The Olympic Games are scheduled to be held during September, 2000 in Sydney
Australia. Several Australian states (New South Wales, Victoria, Australian
Capital Territory and Tasmania) have changed the daylight saving time transition
start date from the last Sunday in October forward two months to the last Sunday
in August.

NOTE: for Tasmania, the 1999 daylight saving time start date was the first Sunday
of October.

Daylight Saving Time for 2000/2001
----------------------------------

For the year 2000 only, the official daylight saving time transition dates (as of
March 28, 2000) for each of the states of Australia are:

   South Australia 29/10/2000 To 3/2001*
   Victoria 27/08/2000 To 25/3/2001
   ACT 27/08/2000 To 25/3/2001
   NSW 27/08/2000 To 25/3/2001
   Tasmania 27/08/2000 To 25/3/2001

* The South Australia daylight saving time end date was not available at time of
publication.

Clocks are advanced at 2:00 A.M by one hour on the start day to become Summer
time.

Clocks are set back at 3:00 A.M. by one hour at the end day to become Standard
time.

The change to daylight saving time will affect the transition settings for the
following time zone rules:

   (GMT + 10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney
   (GMT + 10:00) Hobart

Current versions of Microsoft products have daylight saving time transition dates
that do not cater to the change mentioned above. These products include:

   Microsoft Windows 95
   Microsoft Windows 98
   Microsoft Windows NT
   Microsoft Windows 2000
   Microsoft Windows CE
   Microsoft Schedule+
   Microsoft Outlook

With current time zone settings, systems that use the existing time zone
information in the affected states of Australia will not correctly interpret
time related to the new transition to daylight saving time on August 27, 2000.
This will cause the time to be offset by one hour from the correct time.

Implications for the Use of Microsoft Calendaring Software:

In the information below, the "overlap" period is defined as being the days
between the newly defined start of daylight saving time, the last Sunday of
August, and the regular start of daylight saving time.

Any program that relies on the use of time zone information (such as calendaring
software) will be affected by a change to the daylight saving time transition
information. While some programs use the information stored in the operating
system, others maintain separate lists. This information is not readily
changeable, and as such appointments created within the overlap period may be
displayed incorrectly. The following programs maintain a separate table of time
zone information:

   Microsoft Schedule+
   Microsoft Outlook for Windows 3.x, Exchange Server Edition
   Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition
   Microsoft Outlook Web Access

The following products all rely on the time zone information stored in the
operating system to display the correct local start and end times for
appointments. However, because Outlook must maintain information about the time
zone each appointment was created for, some anomalies may still occur when you
are using these products:

   Microsoft Outlook 97
   Microsoft Outlook 98
   Microsoft Outlook 2000

In particular, only appointments created after the new operating system time zone
has been applied will be displayed as expected during the overlap period. Any
appointments created before the new operating system time zone has been applied
will be displayed incorrectly during the overlap period. To avoid these
problems, use the following suggestions. Avoid the creation of appointments
during the overlap period until after the operating system time zone has been
updated.

For any existing appointments created during the overlap period, the appointments
will need to be modified by either of the following procedures:

 - Export the appointments to a CSV file prior to modifying the operating system
   time zone, delete existing appointments in the overlap period, and re-import
   them after the operating system change. When you are exporting information
   from your calendar to a CSV file, the local time is used. After the new time
   zone is added to the operating system, the local time in the CSV file is
   recalculated as GMT by using the current time zone settings.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q197480 OL2000: Changing the Time Zone Without Changing Appointment Time

 - Manually modify each appointment after the operating system time zone has
   been changed.

Avoid creating future appointments in the overlap period in all successive years,
until the operating system time zone is back to normal.

As soon as possible after the overlap period ends, change the operating system
back to the correct time zone for your location.

For any appointments created during the overlap period in successive years, the
appointments will need to be modified by either of the following procedures:

 - Export the appointments to a CSV file prior to modifying the operating system
   time zone, delete existing appointments in the overlap period, and then
   re-import them after the operating system change.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q197480 OL2000: Changing the Time Zone Without Changing Appointment Time

 - Manually modify each appointment within the overlap period in each successive
   year after the operating system time zone has been changed back.

Some users may benefit from using the additional time zone feature within
Outlook. For example, to add the regular time zone as an additional time zone in
Outlook 2000, click Options on the Tools menu, click Calendar Options, and then
click Time Zone. Select the regular time zone for your location as the
additional time zone. With the additional time zone in place, meetings added
prior to the operating system update will show at the correct start/end times as
referenced by the regular time zone. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell
which appointments were created before the operating system time zone
information was modified and which were created after the modification.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows 95, Windows 98
----------------------------------------------------

An update has been created for the following products:

   Windows NT 4.0 (including Terminal Server Edition)
   Windows 2000
   Windows 95
   Windows 98

The update adds a new time zone rule into the registry. The time zone has been
named to ensure it is clearly identifiable as being for the year 2000 only:

   (GMT + 10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Hobart (Year 2000 only)

Note that this solution is English only, however, it has been tested successfully
on some other language variants of Windows. If it is used on other language
variants, the time zone string will appear in English.

The update contains utilities that allow for the automation of the new time zone
addition and later removal. See the Readme.txt and sample files supplied for
further details. Please make sure to review the Readme.txt file in the update
package for known limitations, issues, and usage.

Select from the following options to download the correct update (self-expanding
files) for your system:

   http://www.microsoft.com/australia/support/timezone/2000.htm

   Windows NT/Intel (Windows NT 4.0, Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition,
   Windows 2000)
   Windows NT/Alpha (Windows NT 4.0, Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition)
   Windows 95/98

This is a single download for the above platforms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 3.51 platforms (MIPS, Intel, Alpha) are outside the scope of this
update, however, by using the registry class Resource Kit tools or the methods
documented at the above link it is possible to successfully implement the
required time zone updates.

There is currently no solution available for Microsoft Schedule+, Microsoft
Outlook for Windows 3.x, Exchange Server Edition, and Microsoft Outlook for
Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition.

Programs built upon Microsoft Collaboration Data Object (CDO) such as Microsoft
Outlook Web Access will also be affected by a change to the daylight saving time
transition date. Microsoft is currently investigating a possible solution for
CDO to account for the change in transition dates. Additional information will
be posted if a solution is made available. The updates provided above have been
tested on the English variants of Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and
Windows 2000. Although these have undergone exhaustive testing, because of the
large number of available programs and products, testing of all possible
interactions is not possible.

Limited testing on some non-English variants of Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 has
been performed successfully. If used on other language variants, the time zone
string will appear in English.

Utilities in the update have been supplied as-is and are subject to Resource Kit
support limitations.

Normal precautions such as full systems backups, creation of an Emergency Repair
disk, and off-line testing should be performed prior to full production
implementation.

If you use a Web-based or third party e-mail or calendaring solution, you need to
check with your supplier for the handling of time zone related issues.

time zone information that is correct for pre-year 2000:
