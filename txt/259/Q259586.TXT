The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 1.2, 1.2 SP1, 1.2 SP2, 1.2 SP3, 1.2 SP4, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server (SMS) version 1.2, the Microsoft Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) implementation is assigned a base object identifier
(OID) of 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.4.1, where:

   311=Microsoft
   1=Software
   4=Apps
   1=SMS

Because Microsoft SQL Server registered the same base OID (311.1.4.1) value
before SMS was released, there is a conflict between the registered OID for the
Event to Trap Translator and SQL. Therefore, it is impossible to filter for all
traps coming from one of these sources without also picking up the others.

In SMS version 2.0, the SNMP implementation has been corrected to use a base OID
of 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.1.13.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The registry location for the OID is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/software/microsoft/snmp_events/Parameters/BaseEnterpriseOID

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/software/microsoft/snmp_events/Parameters/SupportedView

Additional query words: prodsms
