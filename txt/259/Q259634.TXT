TITLE   :XADM: How to Obtain Correct Size of the Exchange Server Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Exchange Server services are running, the main database files (the Dir.edb,
Priv.edb, and Pub.edb files) are locked open; the size of these files may not be
dynamically updated.

For example, if a new Priv.edb file has a size of 2 megabytes (MB), and 100 MB of
data is moved or copied to that Priv.edb file, the file system may still report
that the Priv.edb file is only 2 MB.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can update the file size of a database by using one of the two following
methods:

 - Stop and start the corresponding Exchange Server service for that database.

-or-

 - Remove the archive bit from the database and then reapply the archive bit. To
   remove the archive bit:

   1. Start Microsoft Windows NT Explorer.

   2. Right-click the *.edb file, and then click Properties in the shortcut
      menu.

   3. In the Properties dialog box, click the General tab, click to clear the
      Archive check box, and then click Apply.

Reapply the archive bit after you check the size of the database.

Additional query words: wrong size small file cache
