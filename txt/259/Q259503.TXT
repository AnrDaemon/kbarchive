TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 292 When Performing a Directory Import
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a directory import the following error message may be
displayed:

   Directory Import Complete
   XX Warning events were encountered but not logged.
   XX error descriptions were encountered in the system Application log.
   The file c:\csvfilename.err contains copies of all object descriptions
   containing errors.

The Csvfilename.err contains information about the object that the error was
generated by similar to the following:

   Mailbox,,"Display Name","Last Name","First Name",","Alias Name","Directory
   Name"...,Recipients

The following event ID is logged in the application event log:

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: MSExchangeDSImp
   Event Category: None
   Event ID: 291
   Computer: Exchange_ServerName
   Description:
   Unable to create Mailbox Username because the required Home-Server
   attribute was not specified.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the import file needs the Home-Server column in the
header to create a new mailbox. The default mode is update, which creates the
object if it does not exist or modifies the object if it does exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, add the Home-Server column to the Header.csv file.
