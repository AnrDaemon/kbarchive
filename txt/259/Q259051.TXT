TITLE   :Compass Client Shuts Down Unexpectedly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) Compass client may stop responding
(hang) or shut down unexpectedly. This may occur frequently. This may also occur
when you attempt to gain access to a specific object in the directory.

CAUSE
=====

The Compass client caches files locally to improve the speed of directory
access. If the cached files become corrupted, the Compass client may hang or
shut down unexpectedly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Clear the entire contents of the cache folder. The default cache location is the
Program Files\Zoomit\Compass\Cache folder or the Program Files\Microsoft
Metadirectory Services\Compass\Cache folder.

To clear the cache, use Windows Explorer to delete the entire contents (files and
folders) of the Program Files\Zoomit\Compass\Cache folder or the Program
Files\Microsoft Metadirectory Services\Compass\Cache folder. The cache contents
are re-created automatically when you next start Compass.
