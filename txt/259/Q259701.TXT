TITLE   :Extra Lines Appear in LU3 Print Job When You Use PDT
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSNA400sp4fix kbSNA400PreSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

LU3 print jobs that use a Printer Definition Table (PDT) may have extra blank
lines inserted at the end of each page or at the end of the print job.

CAUSE
=====

3270 Write Control Characters (WCC) are used at the beginning of each LU3 print
job to define print settings. With LU3 printing, bits 2 and 3 of the WCC define
the printout format. If bits 2 and 3 of the WCC are both set to zero, the line
length is determined by New Line or Carriage Return characters, and the End of
Medium (EM) character indicates the end of the message.

If the WCC specifies that the EM character, 0x19, indicate the end of the print
job and the EM character is not actually present in the print datastream, all
remaining characters in the print data buffer are interpreted as null characters
(0x00). This adds additional characters to the datastream, which are interpreted
as spaces when the job is printed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0 Service Pack 3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, a default screen buffer size of 1,920 is used if the
WCC specifies an EM and there is no EM included in the print job. If the print
job writes beyond the end of this buffer, the buffer is extended to a maximum of
3,612 characters.
