======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Information Services 5.0 default installation path is
%systemdrive%\Inetpub\Wwwroot for the Web and %systemdrive%\Inetpub\Ftproot for
FTP.

At this time, you can only modify the default installation paths for FTP and Web
roots either in an unattended setup mode as part of a Windows 2000 unattended
installation or as an unattended component installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the default installation paths for FTP and the Web during an
unattended installation, you must:

1. Create an Unattend.txt file and place it on a drive that will be accessible
   to the Windows 2000 unattended installation program. The Unattended.txt file
   will be accessed during setup.

2. Include the following section in the unattended installation file:

   [InternetServer] PathFTPRoot=path to FTPRoot PathWWWRoot=path to WwwRoot

For example:

   [InternetServer]
   PathFTPRoot=D:\Inetpub\Ftproot
   PathWWWRoot=D:\Inetpub\Wwwroot

To change the default installation paths for FTP and the Web during an unattended
component installation, you must follow this procedure:

1. Create an unattended install file and name it Iis.txt. This file will be
   accessed during the unattended component installation. The answer file can be
   any Windows 2000 answer file. It must contain a "Components" and an
   "InternetServer" section header. For example:

   

   [Components]
   iis_common = on
   iis_inetmgr = on
   iis_www = on
   iis_ftp = on
   iis_htmla = on

   [InternetServer]
   PathFTPRoot=D:\Inetpub\Ftproot
   PathWWWRoot=D:\Inetpub\Wwwroot

2. Use the Sysocmgr.exe command to start the installation of the FTP or Internet
   Information Services components. Assuming the answer file that you created in
   step 1 was named Iis.txt, the command line to execute the installation would
   be:

   "sysocmgr /i:%windir%\inf\sysoc.inf /u:c:\iis.txt" (without the quotation
   marks)

Note that you could also use a batch file to execute the setup. The batch file
must contain a command similar to the command above.
