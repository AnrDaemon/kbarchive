SUMMARY
=======

Every Component Object Model (COM) object must implement at least one interface.
Visual Basic simplifies this concept by creating a default interface that can be
created automatically for each class. Visual Basic also hides the name of the
default interface.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a class module, Class1, Visual Basic creates a hidden interface named
_Class1 as a default. When you use the OLEVIEW tool to look at the compiled
Visual Basic components' type library, you can see that Visual Basic creates a
CoClass named Class1, which implements _Class1 as the default interface. The
Visual Basic components' type library looks like the following:

   [
      hidden,
      ...
   ]
   interface _Class1 {
      ...
   }
   coclass Class1 {
      [default] interface _Class1;
   };

You can create a Class1 object like the following:

   Dim myObject as Class1
   set myObject = new Class1
   ' then call myObject's any public methods...

The variable myObject of type Class1 is transparently cast to the _Class1
reference by the Visual Basic Compiler (because clients only use interface
references to access COM objects.) Using Class1 as an alias for the _Class1
interface makes it very easy to create a COM-compliant object in Visual Basic.
