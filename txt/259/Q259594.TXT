TITLE   :XADM: Mailbox Manager Scans Excluded Parent Folder Subfolders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:kbtool exc55

SUMMARY
=======

In Mailbox Manager, if the Other Folders option is selected, Mailbox Manager
cleans subfolders under excluded parent folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if an administrator does not want a contacts folder to be scanned
and a user has a subfolder of contacts under the parent contacts folder, that
subfolder is cleaned when Mailbox Manager runs. This behavior is by design. The
following information is from the Mbmanug.htm file that is included with
Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 and Mailbox Manager:

   The Other Folders option sets the age limit for all folders other than those
   specifically listed on the dialog box. All subfolders, including subfolders
   of the listed folders, belong to this category. For example, a subfolder of
   the Inbox folder would not take its age limit from its parent folder - Inbox
   - but from the Other Folders value.

To prevent Mailbox Manager from cleaning subfolders under excluded parent
folders, exclude the message class, because that exclusion applies to folders
and subfolders. For additional information about how to exclude certain message
classes in Mailbox Manager, click the article number below to view the article
