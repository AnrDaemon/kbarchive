The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you attempt to log on to the
domain from a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Workstation:

   The system could not log you on to this domain because the system's computer
   account in its primary domain is missing or the password on that account is
   incorrect.

Resetting the machine account does not correct this problem.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of problems with the remote procedure call (RPC)
registry information.
