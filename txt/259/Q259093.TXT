SUMMARY
=======

How much work is it to comply with the Application Specification for Windows
2000?

For developers who begin working toward meeting the Application Specification for
Windows 2000 early in the development cycle, there is very little incremental
work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The reality is that you may have met many of the requirements already. Every
application needs an install, for example. However, the Application
Specification for Windows 2000 outlines how customers would best benefit from
its implementation.

For developers who are nearing the end of the product development cycle, it may
require more effort to retrofit the application to comply. That is why Microsoft
encourages developers to begin reviewing the Application Specification for
Windows 2000 as soon as possible in the product cycle.
