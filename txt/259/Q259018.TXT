======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the information store process starts, an Event ID 7200 similar to the
following may be logged:

   Event ID: 7200
   Source: MSExchangeIS Public
   Type: Error
   Category: General

   Background thread FBackgroundTimedEvent halted due to error code 0x80004005.

NOTE: The error code that is returned is not relevant and may vary.

Background tasks do not run and the database may grow to a very large size.
Online and offline defragmentation cannot perform maintenance, so old messages
are not cleaned up and removed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if there is invalid data in the TimedEvents table. This
data can be an INVALID FILETIME variable or a date that was out of range (for
example, 7/3/03). This results in an error when calling the EcSubtractFileTimes
function.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to help you
repair the TimedEvents table.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Invalid data may enter the TimedEvents table when you try to synchronize the
time of the server to an external time source.
