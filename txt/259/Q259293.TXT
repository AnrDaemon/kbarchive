TITLE   :Allocate Request May Stop Responding When Host Rejects SNASVCMG
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSNA400sp4fix kbSNA400PreSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An APPC or CPIC application's Allocate request may stop responding indefinitely.
This can occur if the Allocate request is issued when the host has previously
rejected SNA Server LU6.2 BIND requests to reestablish a new LU6.2 session. In
this case, the Allocate request should complete with an error message instead of
failing to respond.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server may fail to respond to a client's Allocate request if the host
has previously rejected a SNASVCMG mode BIND command sent by SNA Server for the
LU-LU pair. This problem is due to a timing window in the SNA Server LU6.2 BIND
retry code.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

In the client application, you can cancel the outstanding [MC_]ALLOCATE request
that has stopped responding.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 4.0, SP1,
SP2 and SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you apply the update, the server properly reports an error message back to
the client application, which causes the APPC [MC_]ALLOCATE or CPIC CMALLC
request to complete with an error message. The cause for the host rejection of
the SNA Server SNASVCMG BIND attempts should still be investigated on the host
side.
