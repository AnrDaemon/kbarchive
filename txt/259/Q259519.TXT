TITLE   :PRB: Image Control Invisible When Visible Property Set to True
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport kbOSWinCE300

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you place an Image control on a form and set its Visible property to True,
the control seems to stay invisible after you run the application in emulation
and on the device.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the Form and the Image control have the same default
background color. The Visible property of the Image control is actually working.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, change the background color of the Form. However, this
solution only works for the Palm-size PC and the Handheld PC/Pro. On the Pocket
PC, if you change the background color of the Form, it still does not show the
Image control although its Visible property is actually True. To solve this, you
can assign its Picture property to a bitmap and the Image control then becomes
visible.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new eMbedded Visual Basic project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, select Components, and then select Microsoft CE Image
   Control 3.0.

3. Add an Image control (ImageCtl1) to the form and set its Visible property to
   False.

4. Add the following code:

   Private Sub Form_Click()
      MsgBox ImageCtl1.Visible 
      ImageCtl1.Visible = True
      MsgBox ImageCtl1.Visible 
   End Sub

5. Run the project in emulation. Click the Form, and note that the first message
   box displays False, and the second message box displays True. However, the
   Image control stays invisible.
