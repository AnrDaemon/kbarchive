The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro is documented as having 16 digits of precision. This is an
approximation: the actual maximum exactly representable number is
9007199254740992 (2^53).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Floating point numbers are stored in 8-byte or 64-bit representations. There are
12 bits of overhead, leaving 52 bits to store the number. There is one more
implied bit that gives you 2^53 as the maximum. The maximum number that can be
stored by Visual FoxPro is 2^1023. The highest power of two that is printed out
exactly using the ? command with the default setting of SET DECIMALS TO 2 is
2^43.

The following code demonstrates this:

   * Start of Code
   SET DECIMALS TO 2
   ? 2^43             && All digits displayed
   ? 2^44             && Scientific notation

   SET DECIMALS TO 5
   ? 2^53             && Maximum exact number

   ? 2^53 - 1         && Correct result
   ? 2^53 + 1         && Incorrect result: rounded in floating point

   ? 2^1023           && Cannot display: *'s will be printed
   ? 2^1022           && Can display
   * End of Code
