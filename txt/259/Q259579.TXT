======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you search for Microsoft Word documents that contain words with nonbreaking
hyphens (CTRL+HYPHEN), you may get unexpected results. For example, if a
document contains the word "Schol-lers" (without the quotation marks) with a
nonbreaking hyphen between "Schol " (without the quotation marks)and "lers"
(without the quotation marks), the following query does not return the
document:

   @Contents Schollers

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Office filter cannot handle the non-breaking hyphen. Therefore, in
this example, "Schol " (without the quotation marks)and "lers" (without the
quotation marks) are stored as separate strings in the catalog.

==========
