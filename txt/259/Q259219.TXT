TITLE   :XADM: Incorrect Year 2000 Date In the Sent and Received Logs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send messages by using the Microsoft Mail (PC) message transfer agent
(PCMTA) from the Microsoft Mail Connector between Exchange Server and a
Microsoft Mail (MS Mail) postoffice, the Sent.log and Recv.log files contain an
incorrect date for the year 2000. The date format that is displayed for the year
2000 in the Sent.log and Recv.log is the following:

   24/02/10 18:01 11689 KEAAU1/KEASYD/$SYSTEM

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Microsoft Mail Connector does not correctly
convert the date for the year 2000 to a two-digit format, which is required for
the Sent.log and Recv.log files.
