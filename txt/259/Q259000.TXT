TITLE   :PRB: Space in CREATE FROM Field Name Causes Error

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you accidentally add a space to a field name in a table created with the COPY
STRUCTURE EXTENDED command, after creating the table with the CREATE FROM
command, any immediate attempt to access that field (such as with a BROWSE
statement) fails with the following error:

   The data source for this object must be a variable reference.

If the table is in a database, any later attempt will fail with the same error.
If it's a free table, closing the table and re-opening it causes Visual FoxPro
to replace the space in the field name with an underscore.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following code in the Command window:

   * Start of Code
   USE HOME() + "labels"

   COPY STRUCTURE EXTENDED TO tableFrom
   USE tableFrom EXCLUSIVE
   ZAP
   INSERT INTO tableFrom ;
       (field_name, field_type, field_len) ;
       VALUES ;
       ("a a", "C", 10)

   CREATE DATABASE dbcTo

   *!* VFP 3 creates the table in the open database.
   *!* CREATE tableTo FROM tableFrom 
   *!* VFP 5 and 6 allow you to specify the database 
   *!* when creating a table.
   CREATE tableTo DATABASE dbcTo FROM tableFrom 

   *!* Note: if you run the VFP 3 code in VFP 5/6 and
   *!* then use the ADD TABLE command, the error you 
   *!* will get on BROWSE is :
   *!* "The fields in table 'c:\temp\tableTo.dbf' 
   *!* did not match the entries in the database."
   SELECT tableTo
   BROWSE
   *End Of Code
