   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

For a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client, the default maximum client log
file size is 100 KB. This article describes how to increase the log file size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To increase the client log file size, use the steps in the appropriate section.

Clients Running Microsoft Windows NT
------------------------------------

1. Use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

   HKey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Client
   Properties

2. Add the following new value:

   Value Name: Log File Size for Debugging
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 400 (hexadecimal) for a 1-MB maximum log file size

3. Quit Registry Editor.

4. Stop and restart the SMS Client services.

Clients Running Microsoft Windows95/Microsoft Windows 98
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

   HKey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Client
   Properties

2. Add the following new value:

   Value Name: Log File Size for Debugging
   Data Type: DWORD
   Value: 400 (hexadecimal) for a 1-MB maximum log file size

3. Quit Registry Editor.

4. Restart the computer.

Using a Registry File
---------------------

You can also create a registry (.reg) file to make the registry changes listed
earlier in this article. To do so, use any text editor (such as Notepad) to
create a text file with a .reg extension. Add the following text to the file:

   REGEDIT4

   ;;-----------------------------------------------------------
   ;; Increases the default log size for SMS 2.0 clients to
   ;; 1,024 KB
   ;;-----------------------------------------------------------

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Client
   Properties]
   "Log File Size for Debugging"=dword:00000400

NOTE: You must save the file with a .reg file name extension, not with the
default .txt extension for a text file.

Double-click the .reg file on any client computer on which you want to increase
the maximum log file size.
