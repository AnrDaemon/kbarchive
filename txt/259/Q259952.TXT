SUMMARY
=======

If a 3D accelerator card is installed in your computer in addition to a primary
display adapter, the 3D accelerator card is not detected by Microsoft
StarLancer.

StarLancer only detects the primary video adapter that is installad in the
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the 3D accelerator card that is installed in your computer is not
detected by StarLancer, you can only configure 3D Render Mode to use your
primary video adapter or the Software Renderer when you play the game.
