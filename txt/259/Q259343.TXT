   Event Category: Transport Delivering
   Event ID: 2025
   Date: 4/7/2000
   Time: 3:41:08 PM
   User: N/A
   Computer: AANGBWAS012
   Description:
   The delivery of a message failed due to error 8004010F. A non-delivery
   report is being sent to the message's originator.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if a moderated public folder or another rule that forwards
posts to Exchange Server mailboxes sends e-mail messages to specified accounts.
If an account is deleted, the rule still attempts to send the message and
generates an NDR and the events in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, open the properties for the public folder in question
from a mailbox that has owner rights. Click the Administration tab, click
Moderated Folder, and then verify that any mailboxes in the To box are still
valid mailboxes. Click Folder Assistant, and then check any rules that are
created for the folder to ensure that all of the accounts that are listed are
valid.
