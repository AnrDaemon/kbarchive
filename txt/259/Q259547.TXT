The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the SET COMPATIBLE ON command, the BROWSE LAST (or BROWSE NOINIT)
command does not show the previous settings of the Browse window.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the SET COMPATIBLE OFF command if the BROWSE LAST command behavior is more
important than the other features affected by the SET COMPATIBLE command. The
SET COMPATIBLE command is also controlled by Tools:Options:General:dBase
compatibility.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Type the following code into the Command window:

   USE HOME() + "labels"
   BROWSE
   *!* Move the first column to the end and close the window
   BROWSE LAST
   *!* Note that the columns are as you left them
   SET COMPATIBLE ON
   BROWSE LAST

Note that the columns are now in their original order.
