When you attempt to synchronize directories from Microsoft Exchange Server to a
Lotus Notes server using Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, the
following events may be logged in the application log:

   Event ID: 41129
   Source: MSExchangeNOTES
   Type: Error
   Category: Notes Directory
   Description:
   Insufficient access rights to the Notes database
   <Notes_server>/<Notes_domain>!!names.nsf - Current Access level:
   2, Access Level Required: 3

   -and-

   Event ID: 64092
   Source: MSExchangeNOTES
   Type: Error
   Category: Notes Directory
   Description:
   Error {Not available} detected when Opening a Note

NOTE: <Notes_server> is the name of the Lotus Notes server and
<Notes_domain> is the name of the Lotus Notes domain.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes (for example,
Connector.ID) uses a Notes ID in which the access rights have been changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change the access rights in Exchange Notes Connector ID
to Manager or higher.
