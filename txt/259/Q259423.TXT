TITLE   :XADM: Removing Folder Instance Results in Error c1040af3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remove an instance of a folder under Folders on this
Information Store on the Instances tab of the public information store
properties, the following error message may be displayed:

   You do not have the permissions required to complete the operation on the
   information store.

   Microsoft Exchange Information Store
   ID no: c1040af3

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the folder is homed in a different site and the folder
is "secured." In Exchange Server 5.5, there is a new "Limit Administrative
Access to Home Site" property on each public folder, which keeps the folder from
being administered or rehomed from any Exchange Server site other than the home
site. When this attribute is enabled on a public or system folder, the folder is
a "secured" folder. This "Limit Administrative Access to Home Site" check box is
not selected by default for system folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

 - Unsecure the folders in the home site. After this attribute change replicates
   to the server where the replica exists, you can remove the replica by using
   the Instances tab in the Public Information Store object of this server.

-or-

 - Have an administrator in the home site remove the replica for the folder that
   you want to remove.

Use caution when you unsecure folders, because an unsecured folder can be rehomed
by an administrator from another site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Exchange Server 5.5, only public folders that are created by users are
secured by default. System folders (which include Organization forms,
EventConfig folders, offline Address Books, and Schedule+ Free/Busy folders) are
not secured.

To secure a folder (system folder), open the properties of the folder that you
want to secure, and then click to select the "Limit Administrative Access to
Home Site" check box. To unsecure a folder (public folder), open the properties
of the folder that you want to unsecure, and click to clear the "Limit
Administrative Access to Home Site" check box.
