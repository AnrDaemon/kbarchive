   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

It can be difficult to troubleshoot problems with the Profile Quota Manager tool
(Proquota.exe). However, you can use the checked version of Proquota.exe with a
registry change to create a log file in the root folder of drive C that is
useful in debugging problems with Proquota.exe. Proquota.exe is invoked by the
Limit Profile Size policy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To enable the log file:

1. Rename the Proquota.exe file in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder to
   Proquota.old or some other name.

2. Copy the checked version of the Proquota.exe file to the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder on the client computer that you want to debug.
   The checked version of the Proquota.exe file must match the version of the
   operating system being used.

3. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32) and locate the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

4. Create a new value named ProquotaDebugLevel as a REG_DWORD value. Assign data
   value 10002 in hexadecimal.

5. Restart the computer.

Log information is recorded in the root folder of drive C in the Proquota.log
file. You can view the contents of the file with any text editor (such as
Notepad).
