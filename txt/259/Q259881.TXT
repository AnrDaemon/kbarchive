-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an Internet e-mail message under the following conditions

 - Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 is installed on the server.

 - Either Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook has the two following
   transport providers on the client:

    - The Microsoft Exchange Transport provider.

    - The Internet Mail Service provider.

 - The Internet Mail Service is set first in the order of transports.

 - The Exchange Server recipient is set in the To or Cc box of the e-mail
   message and the Internet recipient is set in the Bcc box of the e-mail
   message.

   -or-

   The Exchange Server recipient is set in the Bcc field of the e-mail message
   and the Internet recipient is set in the To or Cc box of the e-mail message.

the following event is logged in the application event log:

   Event ID: 2078
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: Transport Sending

   Unable to submit, send, or transfer out a message.
   Check PR_RESPONSIBILITY.

Nevertheless, the message is sent without any issues.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by the Information Store service in Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 3.

PR_RESPONSIBILITY, as described in the error message event in the "Symptoms"
section of this article, is a property of the recipient and is set to True by
default. After the e-mail message is sent by each provider, the
PR_RESPONSIBILITY property of the recipients who have been transmitted is set to
False by each transport provider.

The Event ID 2078 error message indicates that all PR_RESPONSIBILITY properties
of recipients are set to False, so no recipient exists to send a message.

When the Exchange Transport provider delivers the message to the Information
Store service after it sends to the SMTP recipient by using the Internet Mail
Service provider, the PR_RESPONSIBILITY property of the SMTP recipient is set to
False. Therefore, the Exchange Server service provider delivers one message with
the following conditions:

 - The PR_RESPONSIBILITY property of the SMTP recipient in the To or Cc box is
   set False.

 - The PR_RESPONSIBILITY property of the Exchange Server recipient in the Bcc
   box is set True.

In Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3, the fix described in the following article
separates the Bcc and To or Cc box transports:

Event ID 2078 occurs when the Exchange Server recipient is not included in either
the To or Cc recipients or the Bcc recipients.

But in this case, the Internet Mail Service provider sends the SMTP recipient in
the To or Cc box with no issue.
