TITLE   :SMS: Hardware Inventory Doesn't Capture Variables on Win9x
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWBEM kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some environment variables that are seen on a Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft
Windows 98 client by a set command, are not reported during the hardware
inventory cycle even though the Sms_def.mof file has been modified to do so.

CAUSE
=====

Upon startup, Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) reads the
global environment variables when it enumerates the Sms_def.mof. Any environment
variables added after that time (such as through logon scripts), are not
recognized because the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) does not requery
the environment variables.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, you need to set environment variables prior to the
start of WMI, such as in the Autoexec.bat file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
