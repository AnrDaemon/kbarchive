The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

control has scrollbars and is part of a modal formset.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two known workarounds:

 - Set the WindowStyle property of the formset to 0 (modeless.)

 - Set the ScrollBars property of the form to 0 (none).

STATUS
======

listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form. From the Form menu in the Form Designer, use the Create Form
   Set option to create a FormSet for the form.

2. Set the WindowType property of the formset to "1 - Modal."

3. Add an ActiveX control such as the MS Date and Time Picker or the Calendar
   control to the form.

4. Set the ScrollBar property of the form to one of the following:

    - "1-Horizontal"
    - "2-Vertical"
    - "3-Both"

5. Run the form and click on the ScrollBar property of the ActiveX control.

Note that the control behaves as if it is disabled. The click of the control does
not fire and nothing can be selected in the control.
