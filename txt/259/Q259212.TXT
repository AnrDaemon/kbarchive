SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure Outlook to use journaling, the journaling data is not stored
in the Journal folder.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the path for the Item Log File value or Outlook Item Log
File value that is located in the following registry key

does not point to a valid folder location in the operating system file
structure.

on a Microsoft Windows 98 system, this issue occurs.

File value to an accessible path in the operating system structure:

   key in the registry:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Outlook\Journal

3. On the Edit menu, click String, type an accessible path in the operating
   system structure, and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
