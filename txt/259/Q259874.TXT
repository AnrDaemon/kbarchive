PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to the console on a computer that is running Windows
NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, you may receive the following error
message:

   The system can not log you on (6a6) please contact your system administrator

CAUSE
=====

One of the programs that runs as a service is not starting properly because of
an invalid Remote Procedure Call (RPC) binding.


RESOLUTION
==========

Set the startup method for the service to Manual and then restart the server.
Typically, the most recently installed service is the problem. To change the
startup method for the service, use either of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

Use Server Manager on another Windows NT-based server to gain access to the
server that is experiencing the problem:

1. Start Server Manager on another Windows NT-based server.

2. Click the server that is experiencing the problem.

3. On the Computer menu, click Services.

4. Set the problem service's startup type to Manual.

5. Restart the server that is experiencing the problem.

Method 2
--------

If the first method is not possible, you can install a parallel copy of Windows
NT and then set the service startup to Manual by editing the registry from the
parallel copy. For additional information about how to do this, click the
