The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Option Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Management Console (MMC) cannot administer Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) through a Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server client.

If you attempt to do so, DCOM error messages appear in the System log when you
try to expand the IIS and Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) snap-ins. Two error
messages appear in the System log:

   Event ID: 10100 Source DCOM User: <Domain Name>\Administrator The
   server {A9E69610-B80D-11D0-B9B9-00A0C922E750} did not register with DCOM
   within the required timeout.

   Event ID 10100 Source: DCOM User: <Domain Name>\Administrator The
   server {182C40F0-32E4-11D0-818B-00A0C9231C29} did not register with DCOM
   within the required timeout.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by the IIS server security context and the remote
communication mode through the Terminal Server client. For additional

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no workaround for this issue. IIS is not intended for use on Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, and is not supported. Microsoft recommends
that customers running IIS 4.0 on Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition, protect their systems by uninstalling IIS 4.0.

This issue does not exist in Microsoft Windows 2000 Server with Internet
Information Services.
