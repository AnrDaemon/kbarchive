PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set your user profile to the Slovak locale, the long version of the
date contains a grammatical error. For example, it reads "2. mareca 2000"
although the correct version is "2. marca 2000."

CAUSE
=====

The Slovak locale information in Windows NT 4.0 does not contain separate
strings for the long version of the month names.
