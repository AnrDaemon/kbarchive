-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to open an attachment or add an attachment to a new message you
are composing, you may be unable to do so. This issue is most likely to occur
when a very large number of messages that contain attachments are sent to the
Exchange Server computer in a short period of time. The issue is known to occur
when an anti-virus program is running on the server, but it occurs independent
of the specific anti-virus program that is running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
