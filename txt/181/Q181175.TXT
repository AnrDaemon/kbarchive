SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word, you can insert the slash "O" symbol in a document using the
Symbol dialog box (on the Insert menu, click Symbol) or by pressing CTRL+/ and
then pressing SHIFT+O. This symbol, which resembles a slashed zero, is actually
the letter "O" not the number zero. This character is wider than a slashed zero
and may not look correct when used as a number.

This article includes two methods you can use to create a slashed numerical zero
character.

NOTE: Although the character generated by the following methods looks like a
slashed zero, it is not a number and cannot be used as a number in calculations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a slashed zero, you can use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Use the Equation Field
--------------------------------

1. On the Insert menu, click Field.

2. In the Field Names box, click Eq, and then click Options.

3. Under Switches, click \o(), and then click Add to Field.

   In the Field Options dialog box, under Field Codes, you should see a line that
   resembles the following:

   EQ \O()

4. Click between the parenthesis and type a zero, followed by a comma and a
   slash character.

   Your equation field should now resemble the following text:

   EQ \O (0,/)

5. Click OK to close the Field Options dialog box, and then click OK to close
   the Field dialog box.

NOTE: If you don't see the slashed zero in your document, you need to toggle the
field codes. To do this:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the View tab, click to clear the Field Codes check box.

Method 2: Create a Macro

You can use the following example Visual Basic for Applications macro to add the
Slash Zero EQ field to the document.

      Sub SlashZero()
         '
         ' SlashZero Macro
         '
         ' Add the Slash Zero EQ field to the document.
         Selection.Fields.Add Range:=Selection.Range, Type:=wdFieldEmpty, _
            Text:="EQ \o (0,/)", PreserveFormatting:=False
         ' Remove the extra space that is inserted in the field.
         ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes=Not ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes
         Selection.MoveLeft Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=2
         Selection.Delete Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1
         ' Move insertion point to the right of the field.
         ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes=Not ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes
         Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1
      End Sub

NOTE: The macro can be added to a toolbar or menu by using Customize on the Tools
menu.
