TITLE   :Applications and Icons Not Displayed in Start Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the hidden attribute has been set on a file or shortcut in a user profile, it
will not appear in the Start menu. However, the file or shortcut can be seen by
using Explorer when configured to view hidden files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use Explorer to remove the Hidden attribute. Right click the file, select
Properties, clear the Hidden attribute and click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If shortcuts and icons defined in the default user, "all users" or locally
logged on user's profile are hidden and if Windows Explorer (Explorer.exe) is
configured to view hidden files, all files will be displayed. However, Windows
shortcuts that have hidden attributes will not be visible when viewed from the
Windows Start menu

This is often confusing because the user may open Explorer and browse a directory
storing a user profile where the file is visible, while the same icons are not
visible in the Start Menu. To make the shortcuts appear in the Start menu,
remove the hidden attribute for all shortcuts. This action will make icons
visible when viewed in the Start menu.
