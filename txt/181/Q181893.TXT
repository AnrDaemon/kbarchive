 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 5.0sp1, 5.0sp2, 5.0sp3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an application using the ODBC API and running under the Visual C++ 5.0
debugger attempts to connect to an Oracle Server the following exception may be
generated:

   Unhandled Exception in <app_name> ntdll.dll 0xC0000008


CAUSE
=====

This exception is caused by a bug in the Oracle Trace Collection Services DLL
(Otrace73.dll) installed by version 7.3.3.0 of the Oracle Client software.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain a patch from the Oracle Corporation to upgrade the Oracle Client Software
to 7.3.3.0.3 or later.

If the patch is not available, use the Oracle Installer to uninstall the Oracle
Trace Collection Services from the client. This solution should be considered a
temporary workaround until the patch can be applied.

MORE INFORMATION
================

   SQLDriverConnect()
