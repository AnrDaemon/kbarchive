SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the INFO field in Microsoft Word to write
information to the Summary Info dialog box without opening the dialog box. By
nesting a FILLIN field in the INFO field, you can create a template that prompts
you for Summary Info when you create a new document.

For example, you can create a memo template that prompts you for sender,
recipient, and subject information by inserting the following fields:

      {INFO Author {FILLIN "Who is the memo from?"}}
      {INFO Comments {FILLIN "Who is the memo to?"}}
      {INFO Title {FILLIN "What is the topic of the memo?"}}
      {INFO Subject {FILLIN "What is the subject of the memo?"}}
      {INFO Keywords {FILLIN "What are the keywords?"}}

NOTE: To create the field brackets, press CTRL+F9 (Windows) or COMMAND+F9
(Macintosh).

The information you type in response to each prompt appears in your document and
in the Summary Info dialog box.

If you want to update these fields each time you create a new document, add an
AutoNew macro to your template.

      Sub AutoNew()
         For Each aStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges
            aStory.Fields.Update
         Next aStory
      End Sub
