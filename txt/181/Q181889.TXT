======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Office XP Developer 
 - Microsoft Office 2000 Developer 
 - Microsoft Excel 2002 
 - Microsoft Excel 2000 
 - Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your application hangs while automating Microsoft Excel 97 or later via the OLE
control.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs while automating an Excel object that is using in-place
activation in an OLE control. The problem does not occur with all methods or
properties. This problem has been reported with the following method/properties
in the Microsoft Excel object library:

PrintOut
Delete
Dialog.Show


RESOLUTION
==========

A workaround is to not activate the object while running the automation code.
However, if you need to activate the object, do so in a separate window instead
of using in-place activation. For example, this line activates the object in a
separate window:

   OLE1.DoVerb vbOLEOpen

Another workaround is to deactivate the object before calling the automation code
that causes Visual Basic to hang. For example, the PrintOut and Delete methods
cause this problem to occur. Before using these methods, you can deactivate the
object prior to calling the method, then optionally reactivate the object after
calling the method. See the MORE INFORMATION section later in this article for
an example.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the Project menu, click References, and then select the Microsoft Excel
   8.0 object library. For Excel 2000, select the version 9.0 object library.

3. Place an OLE control on Form1 and create a new Microsoft Excel worksheet. The
   OLE control properties should be:

   +--------------------------+
   | Property | Value         | 
   +--------------------------+
   | Name     | OLE1          | 
   +--------------------------+
   | Class    | Excel.Sheet.8 | 
   +--------------------------+

4. Place a CommandButton on Form1.

5. Copy the following code to the Code Window of Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim xlBook As Excel.Workbook
            Set xlBook = OLE1.object
            OLE1.DoVerb vbOLEShow 'or OLE1.DoVerb vbOLEUIActivate
            xlBook.Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Value = "Hello"
            xlBook.Worksheets("Sheet1").PrintOut
            Set xlBook = Nothing
         End Sub

6. On the Run menu, click Start, or press the F5 key to start the program.

7. Click the CommandButton. Visual Basic hangs after it encounters the PrintOut
   method. The object will be correctly printed, but Visual Basic stops
   responding. You must select End Task in the task list (by pressing the
   CTRL+ALT+DEL keys) to end the Visual Basic project and Excel. Repeat until
   both Excel and the Visual Basic project are removed from the task list.

8. Repeat the steps again with the code modified as follows:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim xlBook As Excel.Workbook
            Set xlBook = OLE1.object
            OLE1.DoVerb vbOLEShow 'or OLE1.DoVerb vbOLEUIActivate
            xlBook.Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Value = "Hello"
            Command1.SetFocus 'causes deactivation of object
            xlBook.Worksheets("Sheet1").PrintOut
            OLE1.DoVerb vbOLEShow 'optional: reactivates object
            Set xlBook = Nothing
         End Sub

The problem is avoided by deactivating the object before calling the PrintOut
method. Setting focus to any control on the form will deactivate the OLE control
object.
