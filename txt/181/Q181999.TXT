PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you apply Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and then attempt
to run Setup from the appropriate folder on the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
compact disc, you may receive an error message similar to the following:

   Entry Point Not found
   The procedure entry point UIDecodeEUC_KR@24 could not be located in the
   dynamic library GAPI32.dll.

CAUSE
=====

Service Pack 2 includes an updated Gapi32.dll file that is copied to your hard
disk when you apply Service Pack 2. This Gapi32.dll file is not completely
compatible with the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Setup program.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Rename the Gapi32.dll file in the Winnt\System32 folder on your hard disk. To
   do so, type the following command at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   ren c:\winnt\system32\gapi32.dll gapi32.sp2

2. Copy the Gapi32.dll file in the Server\Setup\I386 or Server\Setup\Alpha
   folder on the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 CD-ROM to the Winnt\System32
   folder on your hard disk. To do so, type the following command at a command
   prompt, and then press ENTER:

   copy <drive>:\server\setup\<platform>\gapi32.dll
   c:\winnt\system32

   where <drive> is letter of your CD-ROM drive and <platform> is the
   appropriate folder on the CD-ROM (I386 or Alpha).

3. Run Setup.exe from the compact disc.

4. If you did not completely remove Microsoft Exchange Server using the Remove
   All option in the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program, follow these
   steps:

   a. Rename the Gapi32.dll file in the Winnt\System32 folder on your hard disk.
      To do so, type the following command at a command prompt, and then press
      ENTER:

   ren c:\winnt\system32\gapi32.dll gapi32.old

   b. Rename the Gapi32.sp2 file in the Winnt\System32 folder on your hard disk
      to Gapi32.dll. To do so, type the following command at a command prompt,
      and then press ENTER:

   ren c:\winnt\system32\gapi32.dll gapi32.old
