The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access a form created with the Microsoft Exchange Forms
Designer, you may receive the following error message:

   Insufficient memory to run this application.
   Quit one or more Windows application and please try again.

CAUSE
=====

This may occur if you have a version of Vb40016.dll other than the one that
shipped with the Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows NT. This file can be
located in either of the following directories:

   <SystemRoot>\System
   <SystemRoot>\ System32

The <SystemRoot> system variable corresponds to the installation directory
of Microsoft Windows NT.

WORKAROUND
==========

Verify that you have the correct version of Vb40016.dll. For all versions of the
Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows NT the correct version is 4.00.2422 and
935,632 bytes. If a different version of this file exists, replace it with the
one on the Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows NT compact disc.
