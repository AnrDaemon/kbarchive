In Microsoft Word, you can create hidden bookmarks by beginning the bookmark name
with an underscore character ("_"). However, when you begin a bookmark name
using the underscore character ("_") while in the Bookmark dialog box, the Add
button remains unavailable (dimmed). However, you can programmatically create a
hidden bookmark. Although the hidden bookmark will not show in the list of
available bookmarks, you can still issue commands that use the bookmark.

Creating a hidden bookmark programmatically will not display an error message
that the bookmark name is invalid.

NOTE: Beginning in Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition, you can
view hidden bookmarks by selecting the Hidden Bookmarks check box in the
Bookmark dialog box.

The following sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro (Sub
procedure) demonstrates how to create a hidden bookmark in Word.

      Sub CreateHiddenBookMark()

         Dim bmark As String

         ' Input box to request bookmark name.
         bmark = InputBox("Type a bookmark name preceded by an underscore")

         ' Add the bookmark name.
         ActiveDocument.Bookmarks.Add (bmark)

      End Sub
