TITLE   :Computer Hangs When Using the DIR Command in DFS Shared Folders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0,2.1,2.5,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the DIR command from a command prompt on a Windows 95 Distributed
File System (DFS) client to view the contents of a DFS shared network folder on
a Windows NT server, your computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for any of the following reasons:

 - The current folder in which you are using the DIR command is several levels
   down on the DFS shared network drive. For example, this behavior can occur if
   you use the DIR command in Folder5 of the following path

   <drive>:\Folder1\Folder2\Folder3\Folder4\Folder5

   where <drive> is the mapped drive to the DFS shared network folder.

 - The DFS volume on the Windows NT server has a volume label.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, remove the volume label from the DFS volume on the
Windows NT server.
