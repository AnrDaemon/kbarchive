SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has received reports that in Microsoft Word 97 with PC Docs installed,
when you click the Open button on the Standard toolbar or click Open on the File
menu, nothing happens.

NOTE: PC Docs is a document management system that allows centralization and
management of shared documents in a network environment.

CAUSE
=====

PC Docs integrates with Word 97 by placing entries in the Windows Registry. If
PC Docs' interaction with Word malfunctions, the Open command may stop
responding.

This problem is most often caused if the path to the PC Docs server is not listed
in the Path statement.
