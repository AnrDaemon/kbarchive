SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Outlook Client and view properties for a message in
the Properties dialog box, the Message ID tab may be missing.

CAUSE
=====

The Message ID tab functionality comes from an installable add-in named Exchange
Extensions. The Exchange Extensions are stored in the extension configuration
file (Emsuix.ecf), which you can install using the Add-In Manager. You can have
the Exchange Server service installed and not have the Exchange Extensions
add-in installed; however, the Exchange Extensions add-in is installed by
default.

WORKAROUND
==========

To install the Exchange Extensions add-in, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options and then click the General tab.

2. Click the Add-In Manager button and then click the Install button to open the
   \Office\Addins folder.

3. Select Emsuix.ecf and click Open.

4. Exchange Extensions should be listed in the Add-Ins dialog box. Click OK and
   then click OK again to close all dialog boxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about installing add-ins, do the following:

1. Type "add-in" in the Office Assistant, and click Search.

2. Click "Load, install, or remove an add-in."
