TITLE   :PRB: SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT Error in IIS 4.0 ISAPI Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbMFC kbODBC kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An ISAPI extension running under IIS 4.0 gives the following error when
CDatabase::Open is called to open a database connection in an ODBC data source:

   Only SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT is allowed when connection pooling is enabled


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the CDatabase::OpenEx function and specify the noOdbcDialog option to open
your database connections.

      CDatabase db;
      db.OpenEx(_T("DSN=myDS;UID=myID;PWD=myPWD;"), CDatabase::noOdbcDialog);

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT flag instructs ODBC to connect with the information
passed in the connect string and to avoid displaying a login dialog box at run
time.

CDatabase::OpenEx() with the noOdbcDialog option calls SQLDriverConnect with the
SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT flag. Using the CDatabase::Open function causes MFC to use
SQL_DRIVER_COMPLETE instead of SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT.

NOTE: Make sure you are using a "System DSN" and not a "User DSN" with an ISAPI
application. The process for creating a System DSN is identical to that for
creating a regular data source. Open the 32-bit ODBC Administrator (in the
Control Panel) and click the System DSN tab, then click Add to create a System
DataSources.

REFERENCES
==========

Refer to the Visual C++ online help for a complete description of the OpenEx
function.
