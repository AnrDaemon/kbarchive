TITLE   :SMS: INVMAC Appears to Stop Responding During Inventory Scan
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

INVMAC appears to stop responding during early stages of inventory. The status
indicator bar does not show any new progress. After a brief period of time, the
inventory scan will continue.

CAUSE
=====

INVMAC is reading the Resync.cfg file. INVMAC reads the Resync.cfg file 48 bytes
at a time. The larger the Resync.cfg file, the longer the delay.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, periodically use Dumpsync.exe from the BackOffice
Resource Kit to purge the Resync.cfg file. Doing this will reduce the size of
the Resync.cfg file, which should avoid the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
