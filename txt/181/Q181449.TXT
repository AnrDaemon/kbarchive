TITLE   :XADM: Error -1022 When Starting the Information Store
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service, the
following message occurs:

   The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service returned service specific
   error 4294966274.

The following entries are generated in the Windows NT event log:

   Event ID: 31
   Source: EDB
   Type: Error
   Category: Logging/Recovery
   Description:
   MSExchangeIS ((313) ) Unable to read the log header. Error -1022.

   Event ID: 1120
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description:
   Error -1022 initializing the Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
   database.

CAUSE
=====

The above errors can be caused by a corrupt Microsoft Exchange Transaction Log
file. A -1022 error also indicates a potential hardware issue; the Event
Viewer's System log should be scanned for indications hardware malfunctions.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rename the Edb.chk file in the Exchsrver\Mdbdata folder. Try starting the
Information Store service again.

The following events should be generated in the event log:

   Event ID: 18
   Source: EDB
   Type: Information
   Category: Logging/Recovery
   Description:
   MSExchangeIS ((137) ) The database is running recovery steps.

   Event ID: 71
   Source: EDB
   Type: Information
   Category: Logging/Recovery
   Description:
   MSExchangeIS ((137) ) Redoing log file d:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb00004.log.

   Event ID: 71
   Source: EDB
   Type: Information
   Category: Logging/Recovery
   Description:
   MSExchangeIS ((137) ) Redoing log file d:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb00005.log.

The above event indicates which log files have been successfully replayed. In the
above example, edb00005.log was successfully replayed. Therefore, the problem
exists in the edb00006.log file.

If there are no Event ID 71 messages generated, the problem may be in the Edb.log
file, in which case the resolution is to move all the log files out of the
MDBDATA directory and then restart the Microsoft Information Store service.
