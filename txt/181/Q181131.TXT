TITLE   :PRB: ComboBox Text Property Does Not Update Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ComboBox Text property is not updated until after the ComboBox Click event
is complete. This behavior may be a problem if the value of the Text property is
required during the ComboBox Click event.

RESOLUTION
==========

The ListIndex property is updated as soon as the item is selected and can be
used to determine the text of that item. To work around this problem, use the
ListIndex property as follows:

   Combo1.List(Combo1.ListIndex)

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Windows CE project in either Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual
   Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a ComboBox (Combo1) to Form1.

3. Add the following code:

         Option Explicit
         Dim x

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            For x = 1 to 8
               Combo1.AddItem "Item" & x
            Next
         End Sub

         Private Sub Combo1_Click()
            MsgBox "Text: " & Combo1.Text & ", ListIndex: " & _
            Combo1.ListIndex
         End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the project.

5. Click the drop-down arrow of Combo1 and click Item1. Note that the message
   box shows the value of the Text property as Combo1 instead of Item1.
