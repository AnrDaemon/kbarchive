TITLE   :PRB: Some Keywords Are Not Highlighted
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Visual FoxPro keywords, like Release in ThisForm.Release, do not show up
has highlighted words in the object's code window or the Command window.

RESOLUTION
==========

The color of text in Visual FoxPro code can be changed using the Syntax Coloring
tab of the Options dialog box that is accessed from the Tools menu. The Area
drop-down list box in the Syntax color settings section is used to select
different parts of the Visual FoxPro language for setting syntax coloring.

To get keywords such as RELEASE and WHATSTHISHELP to use the same color as other
Visual FoxPro keywords, set the Area to Variables and set the Foreground to Blue
or to the color that the Keywords area is using.

NOTE: After setting the Variables item to the specified color, all custom
variables that are created will be the same color as the keywords and commands.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
