TITLE   :HttpMon.exe Does Not Write to CSV File
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0; :2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

No data CSV files are generated in the OUTPUTDIRECTORY when the Microsoft
HttpMon service is started.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the updated version of Httpmon.exe described
below. The new version of Httpmon.exe 2.0 is build 011298.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample Httpmon.ini file located in the %windir% directory included with the
application installation does not include a key field and value to run
correctly. As a result, the application is started (running), but no data is
written to the data CSV files.

To fix the problem, a new version of the executable has been compiled. It is
available for free download at the following location:

   ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/utilities/httpmon

   get Httpmon.exe
   get Readme.txt

After you download these files, replace your existing Httpmon.exe file with the
new one and restart the service.

NOTE: You must first stop the application before copying the new Httpmon.exe over
the existing Httpmon.exe.
