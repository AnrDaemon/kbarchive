TITLE   :XCLN: Cannot Resolve SMTP Addresses, Messages Sent Successfully
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0; :8.01,8.02,8.03
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you address a message to a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) recipient
that is located in your personal address book (PAB) or the global address list,
the SMTP address may not be resolved. Your e-mail client may underline the SMTP
address and send the message successfully, but the address is not resolved to
the display name that appears in the PAB or global address list.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when one or more of the following files are damaged:

 - Emsabp32.dll

 - Emsui32.dll

 - Mapi32.dll

 - Wmsui.dll

 - Wmsui32.dll

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, verify that the above files are not damaged. To do so,
use one of the following methods:

 - If you are using a Microsoft Exchange client, rename the files on your hard
   disk, and then extract new copies of the files from the Microsoft Exchange
   5.0 Client Pack CD-ROM. The following table lists the location of the files
   on the CD-ROM:

      File           Cabinet File
      ---------------------------
      Emsabp32.dll   Exchng4.cab
      Emsui32.dll    Exchng4.cab
      Mapi32.dll     Exchng5.cab
      Wmsui.dll      Exchng7.cab
      Wmsui32.dll    Exchng8.cab

   NOTE: Windows 95 cabinet files are located in the Eng\Win95 folder on the
   CD-ROM. Windows NT (Intel) cabinet files are located in the Eng\Winnt\I386
   folder on the CD-ROM.

 - If you are using a Microsoft Outlook client, rename the files on your hard
   disk, and then copy the files from the Outlook CD-ROM to your hard disk.

 - Reinstall your e-mail client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post additional information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
