The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange information store may stop unexpectedly and record the
following error in the Application event log:

   2/6/98  6:33:11  DrWatson  Information  None  4097  N/A
   The application, exe\store.dbg, generated an application error. The
   error occurred on 2/6/1998 @ 3:33:10.437 The exception generated was

CAUSE

A page at an internal level of the Exchange database engine b-tree became
corrupted. This prevents the information store from successfully starting and
prevents the Exchange Information Store Integrity Checker (Isinteg.exe) from
completing successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
