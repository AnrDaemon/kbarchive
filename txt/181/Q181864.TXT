TITLE   :XADM: Setup /Q Prompts for Service Account
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Setup /Q to install a non-service component, the Setup
program expects the Setup.ini file to have a service account specified.

Non-service components include the Administrator program and Books Online.

If the service account is not specified, Setup displays a dialog box, prompting
for the service account.

This behavior is only seen using Setup /Q.

If you run the Setup program in interactive mode and then go to the
Custom/Complete option and select only the non-service component, Setup does not
prompt you for a service account.

CAUSE
=====

Setup assumes that it is installing service components, even though none were
selected. With the fix described below, Setup checks before asking for the
service account name and password.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
