TITLE   :Latest SGC-Enabled Schannel.dll Breaks IIS 3.0 Key Manager
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the latest Server Gated Cryptography (SGC)-enabled export
version of Schannel.dll (01/22/98, 161.040 bytes) on a Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) 3.0 computer and enable SGC by setting the EnableSGC
Registry Key, Key Manager hangs while generating a SGC certificate request.

For more information, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q148427 : Generic SSL (PCT/TLS) Updates for IIS and MS Internet Products

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Key Manager is not working correctly with the
SGC-enabled export version of Schannel.dll (01/22/98, 161.040 bytes).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Use the SGC-enabled export version of Schannel.dll (11/18/97, 160.528 bytes)
   that comes with Internet Explorer 4.0x with the version of Key Manager that
   comes with Internet Information Server 3.0 to generate SGC certificate
   requests.

 - Use the version of Key Manager (version 4.02.0622) that comes with Internet
   Information Server 4.0 to generate SGC certificate requests. This version of
   Key Manager works without problems when you use it with the latest version of
   Schannel.dll (01/22/98, 161.040 bytes) or with the version of Schannel.dll
   (11/18/97, 160.528 bytes) that comes with Internet Explorer 4.0x.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server 3.0
Key Manager. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
