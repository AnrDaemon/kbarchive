Joystick.exe is a self-extracting compressed file containing a sample project
that demonstrates how to use the Joystick API functions in Visual Basic. You can
use this sample as a starting point for a game program that uses a joystick for
an input device.

When you run the self-extracting compressed file, the following files are
expanded in the Joystick Sample Project directory:

 - Form1.frm (7Kb) - the main form of the project.

 - Joystick.vbp (1Kb) - the project file.

 - Joystick.vbw (1Kb) - the workspace file.

 - Module1.bas (7Kb) - the module containing the function, user-defined type and
   constants declarations.

 - Readme.txt (2Kb) - you are currently reading this file.

How the Sample Works
--------------------

The joyGetDevCaps function is used in the form load event to determine if a
joystick is connected to the system. If the function is successful, the form is
redrawn with new controls to display the capabilities of the joystick. These
capabilities are stored in the members of the JOYCAPS user- defined type
variable. A timer control is used to poll the joystick's position. The current
position is determined by the successful results of the joyGetPosEx function.
The members of the JOYINFOEX user-defined variable type contain the joystick
position information. This information is displayed in text boxes in the form.
