PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbRegistry kbVBp kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to run an application using Remote Data Object (RDO), the first line
of code that references RDO generates error number 429 listed below:

   ActiveX component cannot create object.

CAUSE
=====

This may be due to a registration problem with the Msrdo20.dll file. This error
can also be caused by mismatched DLLs. For instance, the application may find
and use the wrong version of a DLL, such as ODBC32.DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually re-register the .dll using the REGSVR32 utility. To do this, select Run
from the Start menu and enter the following line:

   REGSVR32 c:\winnt\system32\Msrdo20.dll

It may be necessary to include a path to Regsvr32.exe and/or modify the path to
the Msrdo20.dll file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
