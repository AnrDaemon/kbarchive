SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Remote Procedure Call (RPC) server's context_rundown() function is called
when your RPC client is inactive for more 5 minutes and uses either ncadg_ip_udp
or ncadg_ipx as the communication protocol sequence.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. When this timeout is reached, your RPC server
assumes that the client is no longer available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid your RPC server from invoking your context_rundown() function, your RPC
client needs to issue remoted function calls to your server periodically so that
it does not go idle for more than 5 minutes.

The context handle time-out described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article concerns RPC communication using ncacn_ip_tcp not ncadg_ip_udp.
