PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, Japanese version 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing the AT&T Easylink gateway on the Exchange Connector
postoffice (shadow post office), the installation may fail with the following
error message:

   The Ms Mail postoffice could not be found in the destination directory.

CAUSE
=====

The installation program is searching for the Ms Mail maildata directory with
its 19 subdirectories. The shadow post office is a reduced version of the
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks and has no users. Some of the 19 subdirectories
are not included in the shadow post office.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Create the following five empty subdirectories: CAL\, FOLDERS\, INI\, MEM\,
   and MMF\ under the Directory Exchsrvr \ CONNECT \ Maildata\.

2. Try the Setup of the AT&T gateway again; it should proceed without a
   problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Please refer to the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide for more
information about setting up the AT&T Easylink gateway to provide service
between Microsoft Exchange Server and the AT&T system.
