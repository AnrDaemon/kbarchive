TITLE   :XCON: Private Messages Not Always Delivered
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The original recipient of a private message may not receive the message as
expected when the "deliver to both recipient and alternate recipient" option is
enabled. (This option is selected on the Delivery Options tab of the recipient's
mailbox in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.)

The alternate recipient logically does not receive the private message. (See the
Microsoft Knowledge Base article, Q178161 "Unable to Send Private Message to
Exchange Recipient" for more information.)

The sender receives the following non-delivery report (NDR):

   From: System Administrator
   Subject: Undeliverable: test message

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject: test message
      Sent: 12/1/97 12:00 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      John Doe on 12/1/97 12:00 PM

   Unable to deliver the message because the originator prohibited
   redirection to an alternate recipient or the message was encrypted
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:<SiteName>:<ServerName>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server versions 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the new behavior the original recipient effectively receives the private
message and the sender still receives a NDR because the alternate recipient is
not deserved.
