TITLE   :PRB: MFC Generic App Resources Cannot Interact with Desktop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)-based applications, when launched from
Microsoft Cluster Server and set to interact with the desktop, will fail with an
Abnormal Program Termination error message being displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The MFC library attempts to set a computer based training (CBT) hook when a
window is created. This operation is not allowed on the interactive desktop when
the program is not running in the current logon session of the interactive user.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using an MFC application as a Microsoft Cluster Server resource, you
can resolve the problem in one of the following ways:

 - Do not set the MFC application to interact with the desktop.

 - Start Cluster Server in debug mode by using the "clussvc -debug" command line
   in the %WinDir%\Cluster directory.

   NOTE: You must first stop the Cluster Server service first using the Control
   Panel Services tool.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
