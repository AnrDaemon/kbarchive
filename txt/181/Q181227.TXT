KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q193965.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save your page in FrontPage Editor, you may receive the following error
message

   "http://localhost/myweb/<FileName>.htm" is not a valid page URL for the
   current web. Do you want to save the page with this URL?

where <FileName>.htm is the file name of your file. The error may be
different depending on the location of your web.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you save a file with an extension that is not recognized
by FrontPage as a text or HyperText Markup Language (HTML) formatted file.

FrontPage recognizes the following extensions as text or HTML file formats:

 - htm
 - html
 - shtm
 - shtml
 - htx
 - asp

RESOLUTION
==========

Save your page by using one of the extensions listed in the "Cause" section of
this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Web servers recognize file types by their extension. If the server does not
recognize the extension, it may not serve the file correctly or the Web browser
may interpret it incorrectly.

If you save a file with an extension other than one of those listed in the
"Cause" section of this article, FrontPage will not recognize it as an HTML
document. Such features as themes, shared borders, hyperlink verification, and
spelling will not be applied to the document if it is not recognized as HTML.
