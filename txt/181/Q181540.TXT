To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Use the BuiltInDocumentProperties property
----------------------------------------------------

To work around this problem, you can retrieve a document statistic and store it
in a variable using the BuiltInDocumentProperties property with the proper
argument. The following sample macro retrieves the number of words in the active
document:

      Sub GetDocProperties()
         Dim DP As Object
         Dim nWrds As Integer
         Set DP = ActiveDocument.BuiltInDocumentProperties
         nWrds = DP("Number Of Words")
         MsgBox "There are " & nWrds & " words."
      End Sub

Method 2: Use the ComputeStatistics Method
------------------------------------------

      Sub GetNumWords()
         Dim nWrds As Integer
         nWrds = ActiveDocument.ComputeStatistics(Statistic:=wdStatisticWords)
         MsgBox "There are " & nWrds & " words."
      End Sub

For more information about the BuiltInDocumentProperties property, click the
Office Assistant while in the Visual Basic Editor, type
"BuiltInDocumentProperties" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and
then click to view "BuiltInDocumentProperties Property."

For more information about the ComputeStatistics method, click the Office
Assistant while in the Visual Basic Editor, type "ComputeStatistics" (without
the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view "ComputeStatistics
Method."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
