SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word 97 allows you to insert bookmarks into a document header or
footer. In versions of Word prior to Word 97, you can only jump to a bookmark in
a document header or footer when the header or footer pane is active.

This article contains a sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro (Sub
procedure) that demonstrates how to jump to a bookmark in a header or footer.

The following sample Visual Basic macro tests whether a bookmark named Test
exists. If so, the macro selects the bookmark. If the bookmark exists within a
header or footer, Word automatically opens the header or footer pane.

      Sub GotoHeaderBookmark()
         If ActiveDocument.Bookmarks.Exists("test") = True Then
            ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("test").Select
         End If
      End Sub
