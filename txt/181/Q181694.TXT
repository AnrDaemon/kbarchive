SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to update shared-workstation installations of the
Microsoft Exchange Client. These procedures apply to both local and shared
versions of Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To upgrade the Microsoft Exchange Client to Service Pack 2 (SP2), you can either
keep the current installation share point or create a new one. In either case,
you should perform the following steps:

1. From the SP2 directory, run the Setup program for the appropriate platform
   (Win95, WinNT, Win16, DOS) with the following command line:

   SETUP /a

   NOTE: If you plan to keep the same installation share point, delete all files
   from that share point directory before running Setup.

2. During the setup process, specify the location of the installation share
   point. This is the location from which your users will install the Microsoft
   Exchange Client.

3. From each user's workstation, connect to the shared network location created
   in Step 2 and run Setup.exe.

To upgrade the Microsoft Exchange SP2 client to Service Pack 3 (SP3), just run
the Update.exe program for the appropriate platform for each client. You can
either create a shared network location from which to run the SP3 update, or you
can run the update from the SP3 compact disc.
