The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Developer Network Library Archive

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library Archive on
a computer running Microsoft Windows 3.1x, you receive the following error
message:

   Microsoft InfoViewer

   The initialization values for MSDN Archive Edition are not correct in your
   Infoview.ini file. Please run Setup or read the manual setup instructions.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the 16-bit installation program writes incorrect
information to the Infoview.ini file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. If you want to use only the MSDN Library Archive, skip to step 2. If you want
   to use both the MSDN Library Archive and the MSDN January 97 Library, install
   the MSDN January 97 Library. To do so, follow these steps:
   a. Insert the MSDN January 97 Library CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

   b. In Program Manager, click File, and then click Run.

   c. In the Command Line box, type the following line, and then click OK

   "<drive>:\Setup.exe" (without the quotation marks)

      where <drive> is the letter of the CD-ROM drive.

   d. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the MSDN January 97
      Library.

2. Install the MSDN Library Archive. To do so, follow these steps:
   a. Insert the MSDN Library Archive CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

   b. In Program Manager, click File, and then click Run.

   c. In the Command Line box, type the following line, and then click OK

   "<drive>:\Setup.exe" (without the quotation marks)

      where <drive> is the letter of the CD-ROM drive.

   d. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the MSDN Library Archive.

3. Use a text editor such as Notepad to open the Infoview.ini file, located in
   the Windows folder.

4. Add the following lines to the [MSDNarc.Settings] section:

   licensed.name=Your Name
   licensed.organization=Your Organization
   license_version=01/28/97
   license_last_read=11/09/95

5. Verify that the following lines are present in the [series] section:

         MSDN=msdncd18.MVB
         MSDNcdc=MSDNcdc.MVB

6. Verify that the following lines are present in the [all titles] section:

         MSDNcdc.MVB=MSDNcdc.MVB
         msdncd18.MVB=msdncd18.MVB

7. On the File menu, click Save.

8. On the File menu, click Exit.

9. Copy the Relnotes.hlp file and the License.hlp file from the MSDN Library
   Archive CD-ROM to the folder where the MSDN Library Archive is installed. By
   default, the MSDN Library Archive is installed to the following location:

      C:\Msdn\Archive
