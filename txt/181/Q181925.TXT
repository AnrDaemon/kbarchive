To copy or move messages from a PST file to an MMF, perform the following steps
in the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client:

1. Create a profile using the Microsoft Mail and Personal Folders services.

2. Configure the Microsoft Mail service to connect to the appropriate mailbox on
   the Microsoft Mail postoffice.

3. Configure the Personal Folders service to use the PST file containing the
   messages you wish to move or copy.

4. Start the Exchange or Outlook client and log on to the mailbox.

5. If you do not see the Folder List, select Folder List from the View menu.
   From the Folder List, select the Microsoft Mail Shared Folders folder and
   create a new folder called PST Messages. Click OK.

6. From the personal folders, move or copy your messages to the new shared
   folder created in the previous step.

7. Exit Exchange or Outlook.

8. From a Microsoft Mail Windows 3.x client, log on to any mailbox on the
   Microsoft Mail postoffice.

9. Select Shared Folders from the View menu and select the shared folder that
   you created earlier.

10. Highlight all the messages in the shared folder. Select Copy from the File
   menu and choose Private Folders for the Type field. Select a folder (such as
   the Inbox) and click OK.

The selected messages from the user's PST file should now appear in their Mail
Message file.
