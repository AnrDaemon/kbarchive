TITLE   :XADM: Directory Service Does Not Update the Object Count
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Symptoms of this problem occur in both the Exchange Administrator program and in
Exchange e-mail clients as follows:

In the Exchange Administrator program when you view one of the Address Book View
containers, the object count in the status line may be incorrect. This can occur
when recipients are added or deleted from the view, either by changing
attributes or importing users.

In the Exchange Client the problem is an inactive scrollbar when the scrollbar
should be activated. This affects the list of recipients in the view container.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange directory service does not update the object count when
expected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem in the Exchange Administrator program, perform the
following steps:

1. Select the Address Book View that holds the container with the problem.

2. From the File menu select Properties.

3. Select the Advanced tab.

4. Deselect the checkbox for "Show this view in the client address book."

5. Click the OK button.

6. Repeat steps 1 through 5, except in Step 4 reselect the "Show this view in
   the client address book" checkbox.

To work around this problem in the Exchange Client, use cursor keys to scroll
though all names in the view.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
