TITLE   :XCLN: Unable to Forward Meeting Requests in MS Mail 3.x
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.0,8.01,8.02,8.03; WINDOWS:1.0,3.2,3.2a,3.5,7.0,7.5; winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Schedule+, versions 1.0, 7.0, 7.5 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Mail 3.x, when you try to forward a meeting request, you may
receive the following error message:

   The message could not be forwarded.

CAUSE
=====

The meeting request originated from a Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Schedule+
7.x user. Meeting requests sent from these message clients contain additional
properties that are not handled properly by Microsoft Mail.

WORKAROUND
==========

Although not recommended, you can work around this behavior by removing or
commenting out the following line in the [Custom Messages] section in the
Msmail.ini file:

     [Custom Messages]
     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgReq=3.0  ;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1111100000000000;;;;

This allows Microsoft Mail to display the meeting request as a standard message
(IPM.Note), which can be forwarded. However, this will also cause the Accept,
Decline, Tentative, and View Schedule buttons to no longer appear at the top of
meeting requests in Microsoft Mail. In this case, you need to use Microsoft
Schedule+ to accept or decline meeting requests.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a user installs Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.0, the following section is
added to the Msmail.ini file:

     [Custom Messages]
     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgReq=3.0  ;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1111100000000000;;;;
     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespP=3.0;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1100100000000000;;;;
     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespN=3.0;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1100100000000000;;;;
     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgRespA=3.0;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1100100000000000;;;;
     IPM.Microsoft Schedule.MtgCncl=3.0 ;;;;SchedMsg.DLL;;1100100000000000;;;;

This section indicates how Microsoft Mail handles messages with specific message
classes.
