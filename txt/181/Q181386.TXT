TITLE   :Error Message Deleting File Using Setupapi.dll and INF Script
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to delete a file that is currently in use using the Setupapi.dll file
and an INF script, you may receive the following error message even though the
DELFLG_IN_USE or DELFLG_IN_USE1 flag was specified in the Delete File section of
the INF script:

   An error occurred deleting file <name>. The process cannot access the
   file because it is being used by another process. (error #32).

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by versions of the Setupapi.dll file earlier than version
4.0.1381.10 because these versions do not properly handle the deletion of files
that are currently in use.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, replace the Setupapi.dll in the Winnt\System32 folder
with Setupapi.dll version 4.0.1381.10 or later. Note that installing Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0 or later installs the correct version of the Setupapi.dll
file.
