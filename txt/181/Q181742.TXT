TITLE   :XFOR: Message from Notes to Exchange Gets Stuck in Exchange.box
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from Notes to Exchange via the Exchange Notes Connector,
the message may get stuck in the Exchange.box database. The message that fails
is usually from the Notes News Service. When the Exchange Notes Connector can
not convert the message, the connector shuts down and the Connector Admin
Process Manager shows the process with a gray icon rather than a green one. Once
this message is stuck, it must be removed before mail can flow.

CAUSE
=====

The message that originated from the Notes News Service does not have nulls in
the Comment field attached to the CD_LINKEXPORT2 record. The Exchange Notes
Connector expects nulls in this field. When the nulls are not there, the
connector fails to convert the message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
