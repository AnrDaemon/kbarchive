OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

SCS data streams that contain DBCS (Double Byte Character Set) codes may print
incorrectly.

CAUSE
=====

When the last byte in a segment is a DBCS high byte and the first byte in the
next segment is a DBCS Low byte, the Print Server translates the pair of DBCS
bytes into two SBCS bytes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0SP1,
3.0SP2 and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
