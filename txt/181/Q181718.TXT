TITLE   :PRB: "Error Updating the SourceSafe Database via DDCONVW.EXE"
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While installing Visual SourceSafe you receive this error message:

   Error updating the SourceSafe database via DDCONVW.EXE, error code 0. Please
   contact product support for more information.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the folder where you chose to install SourceSafe, there is a WIN32 subfolder,
which in turn contains the file Ddconv.exe. Running DDCONV <path to data
directory> should complete the installation successfully.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Updating the database is the final phase of the installation. All the components
have been installed, including a DATA subfolder. DDCONVW updates the files in
this subfolder to SourceSafe 5.0 format. If this fails during setup, it can be
done manually with the Ddconv.exe program.

Assuming that SourceSafe is installed in C:\program files\devstudio\vss follow
these steps:

1. Go to a DOS prompt.

2. Change the directory path to:

   C:\Program Files\Devstudio\Vss\Win32

3. Run DDCONV ..\data
