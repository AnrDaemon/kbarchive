SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Novell Client 32 on a computer running Windows 95 Client 32, data
corruption can occur to a file that is open by multiple users when record
locking is enabled on the File and Print Service for NetWare (FPNW) server. This
problem only happens with Client 32 accesses the files on FPNW server. It does
not happen with Client 32 accessing the files on the Novell server or a VLM
client assessing the files on the FPNW Server.
