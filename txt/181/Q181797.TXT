TITLE   :XFOR: Message May Be Duplicated In cc:Mail Inbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a mail message is sent from an Exchange Server computer to a cc:Mail user,
multiple copies may be received by cc:Mail recipients, even when the message is
addressed to an Exchange distribution list (DL). An Exchange user included in
the DL will receive only one copy of the message.

CAUSE
=====

Messages are duplicated to cc:Mail recipients when the recipient is on more than
one DL that the message is addressed to or the DL is nested. The message is
submitted to MTS-OUT for each occurrence of the recipient. In Exchange Server,
the store only submits the message once to the Exchange mailbox, but for
gateways it is delivered multiple times.
