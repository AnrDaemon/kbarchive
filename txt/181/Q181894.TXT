SYMPTOMS
========

You are performing intensive OLE Automation, most likely in a loop without user
intervention, and receive the following error:

   The remote procedure call failed.

CAUSE
=====

Every thread that uses COM or OLE must call CoInitialize() or OleInitialize(),
respectively. When this call is made, the OS creates a hidden top-level window,
owned by your thread, for implementation purposes. Because the OS relies on
Windows messaging behind-the-scenes, your thread should, and in some cases MUST,
pump messages. Failure to do so can result in automation errors, and sometimes
in a deadlock situation when another application broadcasts a message to all
top-level windows (for example, an application might broadcast a WM_WININICHANGE
or WM_SETTINGCHANGE message to notify other applications the default printer has
changed).

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using OLE Automation in a loop (for example, writing out 10,000 rows
of data to Microsoft Excel), you need a PeekMessage() loop inside your loop so
that messages will get processed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here is an example of a PeekMessage() loop you can use in your code.

      MSG msg;
      while(PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, NULL, NULL, PM_REMOVE)) {
         TranslateMessage(&msg);
         DispatchMessage(&msg);
      }
