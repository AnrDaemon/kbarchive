TITLE   :XADM: Jet97 Database Header Does Not Contain Last Repaired Date
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Eseutil.exe program with the /MH switch to dump the header of a
Jet97 database to a file, one of the fields in the header is Repair Count. This
field indicates the number of times the database has been repaired using
Eseutil.exe with the /P switch. However, the header does not contain a field
that indicates when the database was last repaired. Knowing when the database
was last repaired can be helpful when you are troubleshooting a problem that may
be related to a damaged database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
