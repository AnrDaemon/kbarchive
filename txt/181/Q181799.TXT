TITLE   :RPC/TCP Connection Attempt Made Only to First Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix kbAPI kbRPC kbSDKPlatform kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows NT 4.0 and prior versions, when an RPC connection is attempted using
protocol binding sequence ncacn_ip_tcp, if the DNS returns a list of IP
addresses for the target computer, the connection attempt will only be made to
the first IP address in the list. If that connection attempt fails, the RPC
connect will fail.

CAUSE
=====

RPC only attempts to connect to the first IP address in the list returned by the
Windows Sockets gethostbyname() call.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
