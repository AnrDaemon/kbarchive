======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

LPR Port no longer appears as an available printer port and the printers that
were previously configured for this port no longer exist.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur for any of the following reasons:

 - You installed third-party printing software (such as Lexmark or
   Hewlett-Packard's JetAdmin printing software).

 - There is a corrupt port.

NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. They now use SDI (Simple Device
Installation) to install network printers. For more information on this, see:

http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/cposupport/ccsearch/getdoc?doc=bpj05973
or
http://www.hp.com/cposupport/networking/support_doc/bpj06765.html

HP recommends a new software admin package (TCP/IP / IPX/SPX Based). For further
information see:

http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/cposupport/ccsearch/getdoc?doc=bpj06723
or

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print
   \Monitors

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Remove any third-party monitors listed here. For example, Lexmark installs
   the following:

   Lexmark update
   Lexmark DLC network port
   Lexmark TCP/IP network port

4. In Control Panel services, stop and restart the Spooler service.

If you continue to have problems, remove and reinstall the TCP/IP Printing
service, reinstall the printer, and then reapply the latest Windows NT service
pack.
