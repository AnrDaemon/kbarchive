SYMPTOMS
========

When you save policy files directly to a NetWare version 4.11 server and use
Client Services for NetWare, you may receive the following error:

   Unable to open s:\public\andyl.pol: error 1317 occurred


This error will occur even if the Windows NT computer is not going through
Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW), but using Client Services for NetWare
(CSNW) to connect directly to the Novell server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

After you apply the fix, shut down your system properly and restart.

NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to the computer running Windows NT 4.0 prior
to applying this fix.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
