======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When advanced security is revoked for a Microsoft Exchange user, the effect of
this on the user's ability to send sealed or signed messages is not immediate.

It can take up to 24 hours for all clients to become aware that advanced security
was revoked for the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When advanced security is revoked for a user, that user's certificate is added
to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL). For performance reasons and to enable
offline use, the CRL is cached on the client computer and expires every 24
hours. Therefore, it could take up to 24 hours for the clients to become aware
of the CRL change.

After clients are aware of the change to the CRL, they will not allow signed or
sealed messages to be sent to the user in question. The user in question also
will not be able to send signed or sealed messages.

If a user certificate has been compromised, it is recommended that the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator disable and then re-enable advanced security for the user
in question. This will generate a new token that should be given to the user.

If an administrator wants to remove security from a user permanently, for example
when an employee has left the company on bad terms, it may be better to delete
the mailbox.
