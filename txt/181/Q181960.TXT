PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an Adobe Acrobat.pdf file as an attachment from an Exchange
Macintosh client, the attachment is unusable when received by any other Exchange
or MS Mail client.

CAUSE
=====

The .pdf file is not recognized by the Macintosh Exchange client and is modified
to be a generic MacBinary attachment. This results in the attachment being
received with a generic icon (usually a Macintosh computer icon) and is not
useable even when saved locally.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be problem in Exchange Client versions 4.0 and
5.0 for Macintosh. This problem was corrected in Exchange Client 5.0 Service
Pack 1.
