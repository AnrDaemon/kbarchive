TITLE   :SNAPRINT Ignores SCS Codes, Print Job Ignores SCS Formatting
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Print Server may not honor SCS codes if you have selected the No Line Formatting
option for 3270 print sessions. The SCS code(s) are ignored by the print
service, and this causes the print job to ignore SCS formatting and command
execution.

In one reported case, Carriage Returns (0x0D) were ignored when they were
followed by certain combinations of other control codes and 3270 print sessions
were configured for No Line Formatting.

CAUSE
=====

The Print service was written to ignore SCS codes if No Line Formatting is
selected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 SP2 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0
U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on
