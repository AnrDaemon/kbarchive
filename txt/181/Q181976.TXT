TITLE   :Windows 95 Client Fails to Connect After Forced Password Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows NT Server user account is configured to require the user to change
the password at the next logon attempt, and the SNA Server Windows 95 client is
started, the SNA Server Windows 95 client logon will report one of the following
errors:

 - If the Windows 95 client is running on a Windows NT system:

   Password Change Error
   Specified old password does not match password in
   logon attempt

 - If the Windows 95 client is running on a Windows 95 system:

   Logon failed

In addition, attempting to start the 3270 application (Win3270.exe) included with
the SNA Server Client for Windows 95 (where the Windows NT password was forced
to be changed on next logon) results in an application exception in Win3270.exe.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 password change fails because the password change routine checks
the SecurityVersion in the registry, which does not exist until the user changes
the Windows 95 client configuration. By default, the client uses the Windows NT
domain password. Because the SecurityVersion does not exist, the password change
routine assumes it has the plain text password when it does not, resulting in
the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
