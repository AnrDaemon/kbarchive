 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, the WordBasic.Input macro command
truncates text if your input text contains a comma. The text is truncated from
the first comma to the end of the input text.

For example, if you input:

   Doe, John

the status bar result will be:

   Doe

To correct this problem, replace the commas entered on the status bar with
semicolons. If you insert the input text into a document, you can then replace
the semicolons with commas.

NOTE: Beginning in Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition, there is no
Visual Basic for Applications equivalent for the Input command as used in
earlier versions of Word. To use this feature in Visual Basic for Applications,
use the WordBasic Property as in the following example:

      Sub StausBarInput()
         WordBasic.Input a
         StatusBar = a
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
