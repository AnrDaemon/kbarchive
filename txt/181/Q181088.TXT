======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you map drive letters to multiple Distributed File System (DFS) network
shares from a Windows 95 DFS client, and then change to different drives and
folders within those shares from a command prompt, the drive letter mappings may
be switched.

For example, if drive X is mapped to Share1, and drive Y is mapped to Share2, the
drive letters may be switched so that drive X is mapped to Share2, and drive Y
is mapped to Share1.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if either of the following conditions exist:

 - There are multiple DFS shares on different servers.

 - There are multiple DFS root volumes that contain mappings to same-named DFS
   leaf objects on different servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade the Windows 95 DFS client from the following
Microsoft Web site:

   http://microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/winfeatures/NTSDistrFile/default.asp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and
Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Releases 2 (OSR2).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If drive letters are mapped to DFS shares on two different servers and you
change to a folder on the first drive letter and then change drives to the
second drive letter, the second drive letter may be mapped to the share that the
first drive letter was mapped to.

If drive letters are mapped to DFS root shares on two different servers, and each
share contains a DFS volume mapping that points to same-named DFS leaf shares on
two other servers, the DFS volume object on one DFS root share may display the
contents of the DFS leaf share mapped to the other DFS volume object when you
change to a different folder.
