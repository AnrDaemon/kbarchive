-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set the diagnostics logging levels for a Microsoft
Exchange component without using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

The diagnostics logging information for each Microsoft Exchange Server component
is saved in the Windows NT registry in the components key under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services.

Each component has a sub-key named "Diagnostics" that holds the diagnostics
logging information.

For example, the Microsoft Exchange Directory Service diagnostics logging
information is saved under

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \MSMExchangeDS\Diagnostics

The Diagnostics sub-key contains values for each of the logging categories. Each
of these values has data of type REG_DWORD. Following are the possible data
values for each category:

   0   - None
   1   - Minimum Logging
   3   - Medium Logging
   5   - Maximum Logging

For example, to set the logging level for the knowledge consistency checker
category of the directory service to medium, you must set the data for the
registry value "1 Knowledge Consistency Checker" under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services \MSMExchangeDS\Diagnostics,
to 3.
