======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When installed on Windows NT, the Windows 95 Host Account Manager fails to copy
Udsuppnt.dll. This results in the following error message when the Host Account
Manager is executed:

   Unable to load udsuppnt.dll.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 SNA Client setup does not copy Udsuppnt.dll to the
\\<snaroot>\system directory when the Windows 95 client is installed on
Windows NT. Host Account Manager (udconfig.exe) tries to load Udsuppnt.dll only
if it is running on Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1), 3.0 SP2 and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
