TITLE   :INFO: Misleading Location for VBCE Application Install Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The source code project for the VBCE Application Install Wizard is located in
the same folder as sample VBCE projects. However, the Application Install Wizard
is not a VBCE sample application and is designed to run on the regular Windows
desktop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample VBCE projects are located in the following subfolders:

 - Visual Basic 6.0: <Microsoft Visual Studio>\VB98\VBCE\Samples

The Setup subfolder is also in the Samples folder, which has the source code
project (Setup1.vbp) for the Application Install Wizard. The Application Install
Wizard can be used to create a custom installation program for VBCE
applications.

The Application Install Wizard project is a regular Visual Basic 6.0 project, not
a VBCE project. Many of the components in the Application Install Wizard, such
as non-variant variables, etc., are not usable in VBCE projects.
