TITLE   :WD97: OLE Objects Appear Distorted When Saved as HTML
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbole kbweb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Word document in HTML format that contains an OLE object, such
as an equation or chart, the image is converted to graphics interchange format
(GIF) format (unless the object was originally in JPEG format) and it appears to
be distorted.

CAUSE
=====

Converting an OLE object to a GIF file will maintain the basic display quality
only with its original size. The display quality may be poor for an enlarged
image.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you save a Word document in HTML format, convert OLE objects to picture
objects. This will preserve the display quality of an enlarged OLE object.

NOTE: Converting an OLE object to a picture object is an irreversible action. You
may want to perform this action on a copy of your document so that you will not
lose the OLE Object.

To convert an OLE object to a picture object, follow these steps:

1. Create a backup document by clicking Save As on the File menu, change the
   name of the file, and then click Save.

2. In the copy of the file, select the inserted object.

3. On the Edit menu, click Cut.

4. On the Edit menu, click Paste Special.

5. Under As, select Picture.

6. Click to select the Float Over Text check box, and then click OK.

7. On the File menu, click Save as HTML.

8. Click OK.

9. Click Yes when you are prompted with the following message:

   This document may contain formatting which will be lost upon conversion to
   HTML Document format. To preserve the initial document, click No to exit this
   dialog, then save the document in Word format before converting. Continue
   with save?
