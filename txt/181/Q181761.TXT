TITLE   :SMS: Cannot Specify an Inventory Scan Interval for SKIPINV
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsmsUtil smsutil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The inventory scan interval is defined for the entire site. SKIPINV, a small
program that can be used to determine whether or not a Systems Management Server
client needs to do an inventory scan, uses this inventory scan interval for
every client. There is no way to force SKIPINV to use an alternate inventory
scan interval.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS section
of this article, or wait for the next version of the BackOffice Resource Kit.
The hotfix should have the following timestamp:

   2/19/98      3:22pm      16,940 Skipinv.exe

With the hotfix, SKIPINV allows you to specify the inventory scan interval
through the command line, as in the following example:

   SKIPINV 30

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2.


A supported fix is now available for version 1.2, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine whether inventory should be taken, SKIPINV adds the inventory scan
interval (specified in the Sms.ini file) to the client's last scan time and
compares it to the client's current time.
