TITLE   :XCLN: Contact Fax Number May Fail with +1 Prefix
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5,8.0,8.01,8.02,8.03
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a fax to a contact created through the Outlook client,
sending to a Business Fax address may fail.

CAUSE
=====

The failure of the fax may occur because the Outlook client has appended a +1 to
the beginning of the Business Fax number. Certain phone systems such as PBX
systems may not be able to process the +1 prefix.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Outlook is responsible for generating a telephone number in canonical format

   [+<country code>(area code) number]

to TAPI, and TAPI is responsible for selecting the digits to be dialed based on
factors and variables specified by the Dialing Properties dialog box. If a
number is specified in non-canonical format, TAPI ignores the dialing properties
and dials only the digits entered.

Because most PBX systems require a "1" to be dialed as a prefix for long
distance, TAPI adds this prefix to a number entered if the "To access an outside
line" option is selected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To bypass this behavior for systems that do not require a "1" prefix for a
number, select Dialing Properties for the modem, create a new calling card, and
enter FG into the field for Long Distance dialing prefix rather than 1FG. This
will allow the number to be dialed "as is" without a prefix.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Outlook Windows 95 client,
versions 8.00, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03; and Outlook Windows NT client, versions 8.00,
8.01, 8.02, 8.03. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
