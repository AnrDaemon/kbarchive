OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a Stop 0x0000000A blue screen error when you use UltraBac for
Windows NT on a SQL Server client computer to back up a SQL Server database.

CAUSE
=====

The trap occurs because Windows NT incorrectly sets a transfer length greater
than the user's buffer. This may occur when reading from a named pipe of
PIPE_TYPE_MESSAGE across the network when requesting less data than the pipe
contains.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
