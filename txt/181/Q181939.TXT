TITLE   :XCLN: Macintosh Mail Migration Fails to Import SMTP PAB Entries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:Macintosh:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Mail Gateway Source Extractor to migrate Mac Mail 3.x
users to Exchange Server 5.5, the Source Extractor may fail to generate SMTP PAB
(personal address book) entries correctly. PAB e-mail address SMTP entries in
the .pri file may be of the following type:

   USER:FIRSTNAME LASTNAME

with no indication as to what mail type the entries are. The only entries with
any type before the e-mail address value may be the local users of the Mac Mail
postoffice, for example, MSA:NetworkAdmin@Operations.

The X400 addresses may appear as the following:

   USER:X400First

with no additional fields included in the addresses.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because PC Mail Gateway and Exchange Mail Gateway addresses
do not conform exactly to the default address format; they have two additional
fields. Therefore, these addresses are never recognized as SMTP addresses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Exchange Macintosh client
version 4.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
