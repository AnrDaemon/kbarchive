TITLE   :Error Message 426 Trying to Retrieve File from FTP Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to retrieve a file from the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server,
you receive the following error message:

   426 Connection closed; transfer aborted.

You can still put files on the FTP server and list the contents of directories.
Stopping and restarting the FTP Publishing Service does not correct the problem.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft FTP server inadvertently tries to create a synchronous socket
instead of an asynchronous socket. This causes connections to fail with the 426
error.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft and
is included in Windows NT Service Pack 4.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
