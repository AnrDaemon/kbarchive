TITLE   :PRB: "Access to an Unnamed File Was Denied" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbCodeGen

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You get the following error when calling CFile::Read():

   Access to an unnamed file was denied.

If run under the Microsoft Visual C++ debugger, you will see the following
error:

   CFile exception: accessDenied, File Unknown, OS error information = 5

CAUSE
=====

You are actually opening the file without read access. The following intuitively
correct code causes the error:

   CFile cf;
      int data;
    
      cf.Open("myfile.dat", CFile::modeRead | CFile::modeWrite);
    
      cf.Write(&data, sizeof(int));
    
      cf.Read(&data, sizeof(int));

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify CFile::modeReadWrite instead of the logical OR of CFile::modeRead and
CFile::modeWrite.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
