TITLE   :PRB: How To Distribute the Remote Automation Connection Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.2,4.2b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 4.2b 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 4.2b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Redistrb.wri file shipped on the Visual C++ 4.0/4.2 CD number 1 (in the
MSDev\Redist directory) implies that the Racmgr32.exe file can be run with the
following four files:

   Autmgr32.exe
   Autprx32.exe (misspelled in documentation, should be Autprx32.dll)
   Racmgr32.exe
   Racreg32.exe (misspelled in documentation, should be Racreg32.dll)

If Racmgr32.exe is run on a system where Visual Basic 4.0 or Visual C++ 4.0/4.2
is not installed, the following error occurs:

   A required .dll file VB40032.dll, was not found.

CAUSE
=====

The Redistrb.wri document doesn't mention that the Visual Basic 4.0 run- time
dependency files are also needed. Racmgr32.exe is a Visual Basic 4.0
application, which needs the Visual Basic run-time dependency files. Without
these run-time files, an error will result.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem you need to distribute the following three sets of
files:

   

   Core Files
   ----------

   Autmgr32.exe
   Autprx32.dll
   Racmgr32.exe
   Racreg32.dll

   Visual Basic 4.0 Run-Time Files
   -------------------------------

   Vb40032.dll
   Ven2232.olb
   Olepro32.dll
   Mscrt20.dll
   Msvcrt40.dll
   Ctl3d32.dll

   Component Dependency Files
   --------------------------

   Gauge32.ocx
   Tabctl32.ocx
   Odkob32.dll
   Mfc40.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Remote Connection Manager is a utility that allows a client application to
connect to a remote server. This utility is shipped with Visual C++ and is
installed by default when installing Visual C++. Machines with either Visual C++
4.0/4.2 or Visual Basic 4.0 installed will not experience this problem.
