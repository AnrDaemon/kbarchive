TITLE   :PRB: "Cannot Access the ClassView Information File..."
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When opening a source-code controlled, Visual C++ project workspace, you receive
following the message:

   Cannot access the ClassView information file. ClassView information will not
   be available.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual C++ project's "No Compile Browser" file, or .ncb file, is marked as
read-only.

RESOLUTION
==========

Changing the read-only attribute of the <prjname>.ncb to read/write is the
only step necessary to resolve this problem.

NOTE: The most common reason the .ncb file would be marked read-only in the first
place is because the file was manually added to Visual SourceSafe (VSS). This
file was never intended to be placed under source control and will need to be
removed (destroyed) from the project within the VSS Explorer. Otherwise, VSS may
change the file attribute back to read-only.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The .ncb file contains information generated by the parser that is used by
ClassView, WizardBar, and Component Gallery. If this file is accidentally or
deliberately deleted, it is automatically regenerated.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Microsoft Developer Studio and from the File menu, click New.

2. From the Projects tab, create a new Visual C++ project using the Microsoft
   Foundation Class (MFC) AppWizard (.dll) in a new workspace.

3. Close the workspace.

4. Open the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

5. Add the Visual C++ project to Visual SourceSafe (VSS) by using a drag-
   and-drop operation to move the project's directory from Windows Explorer onto
   the root project ($/) in the VSS Explorer.

6. Now that the project has been added to Visual SourceSafe, all the project
   files should be marked read-only.

7. Reopen the workspace in Developer Studio.
