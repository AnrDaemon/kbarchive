KEYWORDS:kbfield winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Insert menu to insert both page numbers and an index into your
document, you may see odd behavior when you change the page number to start at
anything other than 1. The page numbers and index numbers will not display the
same number. The index numbers will be correct, but the page numbers will start
at 1 instead of the number you specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the section breaks that Microsoft Word inserts into a
document automatically when you use the Insert menu method.

WORKAROUND
==========

allowing Microsoft Word to generate them for you. The following instructions
