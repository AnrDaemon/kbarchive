======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user with sufficient permissions to change file attributes logs on to a
Windows 95-based computer that has system policies enabled, the Config.pol file
attributes are set to "archive". All other file attributes, such as "read only",
are removed. This would allow unrestricted editing of the policy, which may have
undesired effects on subsequent user logins.

This problem applies to both the Client for Microsoft Networks, and the Client
for NetWare Networks, and is typically manifested when an administrative user
logs in.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the program that applies the system policy
explicitly sets the archive bit, which results in the clearing of all other file
attributes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. This
problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install the
current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
