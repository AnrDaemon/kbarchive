TITLE   :WD97: FileOpen and Auto Macros Renamed
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprogramming kbdta kbvirus word97

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a FileOpen, AutoExec, AutoNew, or AutoOpen macro in Microsoft Word
97 for Windows, and WinStone anti-virus software is installed, the macro will
not run. When you restart Word, the macros have been renamed to similar names,
such as FileOpenOld.

CAUSE
=====

The Macro-Virus prevention feature in WinStone anti-virus software eliminates
the FileOpen, AutoExec, AutoNew and AutoOpen macros.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, disable the automatic macro virus protection by
moving the Lmdwav.dll file out of the Winword/Startup folder. You can still run
the WinStone anti-virus package manually; however, WinStone will not be able to
automatically scan for macro viruses.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For information about how to move files in Microsoft Windows, on the Start menu,
click Help. Click the Index tab and type "moving" (without quotation marks), and
then double-click the "files or folders" entry. Double-click "Moving a file or
folder."
