PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use Clipboard Viewer to save the contents of the Clipboard, you
may be unable to do so.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - You try to save the contents of the Clipboard using a long file name.

 - You try to save the contents of the Clipboard to a folder that has a long
   file name.

Because Clipboard Viewer is a 16-bit program, it is unable to correctly interpret
long file names.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, do not save the contents of the Clipboard using a
long file name, or to a folder that has a long file name.
