<windows>\forms directory. Then perform one of the following two
procedures (A or B) to recreate the file. Then perform C.

a. Remove the client by running Setup and selecting Remove All. Run Setup again
   and reinstall the client.

   -or-

b. 
   1. Double-click the Mlset32.exe file in the Program Files\Microsoft Exchange
      folder to reregister Exchange in the registry.

   2. Either copy the Frmcache.bak file in the Windows\Forms folder to
      Frmcache.dat, or obtain a copy of the Frmcache.dat file from a computer on
      which Windows Messaging is functioning properly and then copy the file to
      the <windows>\Forms folder on your computer.

c. Restart the Exchange or Outlook client and attempt the Send To operation
