KEYWORDS:kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you embed a file or selected text that contains a check box form field, one
or both of the following cases may occur.

Case 1
------

Text or other parts of the file immediately following the check box form field
will be missing.

Case 2
------

If the check box form field is contained in a table, text and table borders
following the check box will be missing.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not insert the file or selected text containing the check box form field as
an embedded object. Use one of the following methods instead.

Method 1: Insert the File
-------------------------

1. In your new document, click File on the Insert menu.

2. Select the file that contains the check box form field, and then click OK.

   NOTE: Click the Link To File check box in the Insert File dialog box, if you
   want to link to the file instead of embedding the file.

Method 2: Copy and Paste the File as a Word Hyperlink
-----------------------------------------------------

1. In the document containing the check box form field, select the text of the
   document, and then on the Edit menu, click Copy.

2. In your new document, click Paste special on the Edit menu.

3. In the Paste Special dialog box, click to select the Paste Link button. In
   the "As" box, click Word Hyperlink, and then click OK.

   NOTE: Do not use Paste Special to paste the text as an object or picture
   because then the same problem will occur.

Word will insert a hyperlink into your new document that will be blue and
underlined by default. To change the appearance of the hyperlink, follow these
steps:

1. Select the hyperlink.

2. On the Format menu, click Font.

3. In the Underline box, select None.

4. In the Color box, select Auto.

5. Click OK.

NOTE: When you click the hyperlink, Word will automatically open your linked
document.

STATUS
======

the beginning of this article.
