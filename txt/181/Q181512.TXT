The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Lsccmmex.exe process causes an access violation when processing delivery
reports from Exchange Server to cc:Mail.

If the Linkage and Windows NT symbols are loaded correctly then the call stack
will look like the following:

CAUSE
=====

The Lsccmmex.exe process is responsible for transforming a mail item from
Exchange format to cc:Mail format. A temporary file is created to hold the
report while Lsccmmex.exe processes it. If the process fails to open the file,
an incorrect parameter is passed, which causes the access violation.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Linkage Message Exchange version
3.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
