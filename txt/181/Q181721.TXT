TITLE   :XCON: Messages Not Delivered Over an Association
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent (MTA) has a backlog of messages
(up to the default threshold) waiting to be delivered. The MTA makes an
association with another LAN-MTA (RPC connection), but does not deliver mail
over this connection.

Various errors may appear in the applications event log concerning RPC problems.
These may include the following events and other similar errors that indicate
RPC problems:

   Event id = 9316
   Category = Interface
   Source = MSExchangeMTA
   An RPC communications error occurred. No data was sent over the RPC
   connection. Locality table (LTAB) index: 53. Windows NT error: 1727. The MTA
   will attempt to recover the RPC connection. [BASE IL KERNEL 24 512] (12)

   Event id = 9277
   Category = Interface
   Source = MSExchangeMTA
   The MTA has issued an RPC Cancel call for thread 1, Locality Table Index: 160,
   Time (ms): 1275740, Cancel result: 0 [SLPS100 MtaBind
   ncacn_ip_tcp:100.5.51.16[1911] BASE IL] (14)

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT RPC component on the receiving computer puts the association in
the wrong address space. Therefore, when the next bind arrives on the correct
address, it cannot find the association and sends a Bind NAK.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The initiating MTA tries to send mail to the receiving MTA, but the receiving
MTA does not believe it has an association with it because the RPC put the
association in the wrong address. It will NAK the RPC Bind request.

After the message threshold has been reached (default value is 50) on one of the
MTAs, it will make a new association and begin delivering messages again.
