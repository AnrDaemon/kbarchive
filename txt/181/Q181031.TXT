======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Within the SNA Server LUA Programmer's Guide (included in online format in SNA
Server 3.0 and 4.0), the LUA Verb Control Block (VCB) lua_post_handle parameter
is incorrectly documented as containing the address of a callback function. This
is incorrect. The field can be either a Windows NT event handle or a window
handle.

See SLI_RECEIVE, SLI_OPEN, SLI_PURGE, RUI_READ and others. Querying for "LUA
CALLBACK" will find all verbs that can contain the LUA_POST_HANDLE.

The documentation reads as follows:

   lua_post_handle
   Supplied parameter. Used under Windows NT or Windows 95 if asynchronous
   notification is to be accomplished by events. This variable contains the
   handle of the event to be signaled or a pointer to a callback function. For
   all other environments, this parameter is reserved and should be set to zero.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2 and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


A supported fix for SNA Server version 4.0 is now available, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The text for LUA_COMMON in the online version of the SNA Server LUA Programmer's
Guide has been changed to correctly reflect this callback verb. It now reads:

   lua_post_handle
   Supplied parameter. Used under Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 95
   if asynchronous notification is to be accomplished by events. This variable
   contains the handle of the event to be signaled or a window handle. For all
   other environments, this parameter is reserved and should be set to zero.
