TITLE   :Event ID 627 Running SNA Services Under WinNT User Account
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows NT service is written to use the SNA Server APPC, CPIC, LUA, or
3270 EIS API interfaces, and the Windows NT service is not running under an
account with administrator privileges, the application will fail to work.

This can be reproduced by trying to start the SNA Server AFTP Server service
under a Windows NT user account. This causes the following Windows NT
application event to be logged:

   Event ID: 627
   Source: SNA Server
   Description:
   Internal message routing error: process id <pid>, mhtype 15, msgtype 0

The equivalent application does run correctly under the same user context when
run interactively.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server was originally designed to restrict Windows NT services to only run
in administrative-level accounts (to accommodate requirements on the SNA Server
services themselves). However, this restriction is not necessary for services
that need access to the SNA Server API interfaces.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
