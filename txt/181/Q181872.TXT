SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates how to create an ellipses button for a property of a
UserControl.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To show the ellipses button for a property, you can set the appropriate options
in the Procedure Attributes dialog.

The Procedure Attributes dialog box allows you to set a variety of attributes by
clicking the Advanced button. The "Use This Page in Property Browser" procedure
attribute specifies which property page is associated with a specific property.
It is this attribute that tells Visual Basic to display the ellipses button in
the property window. A property page can be one of the standard property pages
like Font or Color or a property page you create.

To Enable the Ellipses Button of a Property
-------------------------------------------

1. Open the UserControl project in Visual Basic.

2. From the Tools Menu, click Procedure Attributes. The Procedure Attributes
   dialog box appears.

3. In the Procedure Attributes dialog box, click Advanced >>. The
   Procedure Attributes dialog box expands to display additional attributes.

4. In the Procedure ID listbox, select the name of the property.

5. In the Use This Page in Property Browser list box, select the property page
   to displayed for the property. Click Apply to apply this setting, then click
   OK to close the dialog box.

   The ellipses button should now appear in the container property page. If the
   form hosting the UserControl is still open in your project, it may be
   necessary to right-click on the form (in design mode) and select "Update
   UserControl" to refresh the property window.
