TITLE   :XADM: Offline Address Book Not Updated After Changing Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you move the offline Address Book from an Exchange Server 4.0 computer to
another Exchange Server computer, using the Administrator program of a computer
running Exchange Server 5.0 or 5.5, the offline Address Book (OAB) will no
longer be updated.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange 4.0 does not set any values to the raw object "Off-Line-AB-
Containers". If this object does not contain any value, Exchange 4.0 takes the
global address list (GAL) to create the OAB. In Exchange 5.0 and 5.5, it's
possible to specify more than one address container, so the Exchange 5.0 and 5.5
Administrator program always fills the raw object "Off-Line-AB- Containers" with
nonviewable characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

Two possible workarounds are:

 - Do not use the global address list to create the OAB.

   -or-

 - Use the Exchange 4.0 Administrator program to change the OAB settings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
