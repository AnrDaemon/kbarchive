The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Linkage Notes Connector for Microsoft Exchange Server to send
messages with attachments to Lotus Notes users, the attachment is either missing
or misplaced when the message is viewed by the Lotus Notes user.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is related to a parameter setting in the Linkage.ini file called
NOTESLINKS. The NOTESLINKS parameter needs to be set to NOTESLINKS=RTF.

performing the following steps:

1. In Control Panel, click the Services icon.

2. Stop the Linkage Connector for Lotus Notes Service.

3. In the LinkAge Software V3.2 program group, select Linkage.ini.

4. Search for [LME-NOTES].

5. Under the LME-NOTES section, find the entry titled NOTESLINKS.

6. Remove the semicolon at the beginning of the line.

7. Change the NOTESLINKS entry to NOTESLINKS=RTF.

8. Save the Linkage.ini file.

9. In Control Panel Services, start the LinkAge Connector for Lotus Notes
   Service.
