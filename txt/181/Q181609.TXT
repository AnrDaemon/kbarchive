Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The Click method of the Microsoft Status Bar ActiveX control can become disabled
if a non-modal form is displayed in the form that the Status Bar control is on
and then this non-modal form displays a modal form. Once the modal form is
closed, the Click method of the Status Bar control will not fire.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

NOTE: The following steps assume that the Microsoft Status Bar control, version
5.0 is installed properly on the computer.

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded file.

2. Run the NoClick.scx form.

3. Follow the instructions on the forms in the sample.

4. Note that after the button on the non-modal form is used to display the modal
   form and the modal form is closed, the Click method of the StatusBar ActiveX
   control no longer fires.
