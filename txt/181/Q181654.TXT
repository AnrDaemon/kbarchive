TITLE   :FP: Hyperlink Font Color Settings not Visible in Browser
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.1,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Even though you specified a color for a hyperlink in FrontPage Editor, the
hyperlink will appear in the default color used by the Web browser not in the
color you specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you change the color of a hyperlink by clicking Text
Color on the Formatting toolbar or Font on the Format menu. When you use either
of these commands, FrontPage applies a font (<Font>) tag to the hyperlink.
Some Web browsers do not support using the font tag with the hyperlink tag.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, you can define the hyperlink settings for the page
as a background property. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open your page in FrontPage Editor.

2. On the File menu, click Page Properties.

3. Click the Background tab.

   NOTE: If you applied a theme to the page, the Background tab will not be
   available.

4. In the Hyperlink, Visited Hyperlink, and Active Hyperlink boxes, select the
   color you want.

5. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage
98 for Windows.
