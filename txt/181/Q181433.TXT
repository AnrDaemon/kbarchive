TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 1092 Replication Error By The MSExchangeDS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following event occurs in the Application event log and as a result, the
directory can no longer communicate with the message transfer agent (MTA):

   Event ID: 1092
   Source:   MSExchangeDS
   Type:     Error
   Category: Replication

   Description:
   Internal error: The directory replication agent (DRA) got an exception
   in X400 stubs during intersite replication. Stop and restart this
   Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by lack of disk space on the drive where the Mtadata
subdirectory is located. It can also be caused by a temp or tmp variable that
points to a non-existent or full disk.

This behavior is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, free disk space on the drive where the Mtadata
subdirectory or temp/tmp variable is located or move them to a disk that has
free space, and then restart the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error should only occur on a directory replication bridgehead server.
Another symptom of the problem can be a number of messages queued in the
Directory Service queue of the local MTA.
