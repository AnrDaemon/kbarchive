TITLE   :XCLN: Exchange Client Polls Flag.glb File on MS Mail Postoffice

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Outlook, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client to connect to a
Microsoft Mail postoffice and set the client to check for new mail at a specific
interval greater than 10 minutes, you notice the Microsoft Mail postoffice is
polled and the Flag.glb file checked approximately every two minutes.

If you apply a network trace between the client and the server hosting the
Microsoft Mail postoffice, you see that every two minutes the client checks the
Flag.glb file and thus makes a network connection.

WORKAROUND
==========

For networks configured to do remote Domain Name Service via on-demand ISDN
dial-up, changing the network topology is typically the only workaround.

STATUS
======

This is by design.

The behavior of the client can prove to be unexpectedly very expensive for
networks that are configured with dial-up on-demand ISDN connections, especially
when outbound connections are expected to occur at greater time intervals.
