tracks on the disc, and play the disc at any track or time. This project shows

4. In the Actions list, click Play, and then click Set Default.

To Run the Project

These instructions assume you have disabled AutoPlay.

1. Open the project in Visual Basic.

2. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. Note
   that all the command buttons are disabled.

3. Put an audio CD into the CD player of your computer and note that the
