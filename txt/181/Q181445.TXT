TITLE   :XADM: Files Needed to Perform Exchange NT Backup on Workstation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order to execute the Exchange version of Windows NT Backup on another
workstation to back up Exchange Server computers remotely, the following files
are required:

   Ntbackup.exe
   Edbbcli.dll
   Backup.cnt
   Backup.hlp

Installing Exchange Administrator will install the Exchange version of Windows NT
Backup and appropriate files onto the workstation. In addition, Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 3 is required when installing the Exchange 5.5 Administrator
program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These files can also be copied from the correct CD-ROM into the workstation's
SYTSTEM32 directory. The Edbbcli.dll, Backup.cnt, and Backup.hlp files can be
found on the Exchange versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5 CD- ROM. Ntbackup.exe can be
found on the Exchange versions 4.0 and 5.0 CD-ROM or the Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 3 CD-ROM.

Windows NT versions prior to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 do not contain an
Exchange-aware version of Ntbackup.exe. Also, Exchange 5.5 does not contain
Ntbackup.exe. Thus, the Exchange 5.5 Administrator program must be installed on
a computer with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. Because Exchange versions 4.0 and
5.0 contain the Exchange-aware Ntbackup.exe, the Administrator program can be
installed on any supported version of Windows NT.
