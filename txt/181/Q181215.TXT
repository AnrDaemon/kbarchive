TITLE   :Unable to Pass Query String Which Contains "=" to CGI Program
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT: 3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you call a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program from an HTML form and are
using the query string to pass parameters, a blank string is passed to the CGI
program. The following example illustrates this behavior.

   http://<servername>/cgitest.exe?parameter=value

CAUSE
=====

This is a CGI rule. If an unencoded "=" is in the query string, the command line
isn't used for passing parameters; you have to use the query string.

Note that an ISAPI DLL does not encounter this issue.


RESOLUTION
==========

If you are unable to obtain an ISAPI DLL equivalent to the CGI program when you
are coding the HTML form, you must ensure that the parameters are separated by
the hex substitute for the equal (=) sign. The following example demonstrates
this:

   http://<servername>/cgitest.exe?parameter%3dvalue

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server versions 3.0 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
