 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a file or folder on Windows NT shared network drive
that is on a NTFS partition, you may receive the following error message:

   A Fatal Exception 0E has occurred at 0028:C0231810 in VXD VMM(0D) +
   00001810.

   The current Application will be terminated.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions exist:

 - The file or folder you are attempting to open has a long file name.

 - You have disabled short file name (standard 8.3 naming) creation on the
   Windows NT computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, obtain and install Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1.

For information about Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q142794 Availability of Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can also occur if the networking components have been removed and
reinstalled on a computer that has Windows 95 Service Pack 1 installed.
Reinstalling the networking components from the Windows 95 CD-ROM overwrites the
Windows 95 Service Pack 1 version of the networking files. You should reinstall
Windows 95 Service Pack 1 after installing network files from the Windows 95
CD-ROM.
