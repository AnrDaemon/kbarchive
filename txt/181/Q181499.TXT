OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may stop responding (hang) if an over current condition is detected
from a Universal Serial Bus (USB) device. Over current conditions can occur when
a USB device is "hot plugged" (or plugged in while the computer is on) into the
computer.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 may not clear the over current status in the USB hardware. This
causes Windows 95 to service the same over current condition multiple times.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
