The following sample Visual Basic macro searches for all active toolbars
(CommandBars) that are not visible on screen and docks (moves) them to the top
of the active document window.

   Sub DockCommandBars()

         Dim cBar As CommandBar
         Dim intHres As Integer
         Dim intVres As Integer

         ' Get screen resolution. Subtract 60 from each screen dimension
         ' to account for toolbars that are barely visible on the screen.
         intHres = System.HorizontalResolution - 60
         intVres = System.VerticalResolution - 60

         ' Loop through each CommandBar in Word.
         For Each cBar In ActiveDocument.CommandBars

            ' If the CommandBar is beyond screen limits, then
            ' dock the CommandBar to the top of the Word window.
            If cBar.Top > intVres Or cBar.Left > intHres Then
               CommandBars(cBar.Name).Position = msoBarTop
               cBar.Visible = True
            End If

         Next

      End Sub

To dock a single toolbar, type the following line in a blank macro and then run
the macro:

     ActiveDocument.CommandBars(<commandbar name>).Position=msoBarTop

where <commandbar name> is the name of the single toolbar you want to dock.
