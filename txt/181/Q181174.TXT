The ExitWindows method closes all open programs, quits Microsoft Windows, and
logs the current user off. This method does not save changes to open Word
documents or macros; however, it does prompt you to save changes to open
documents in other Windows-based programs. This method is not available on the
Macintosh.

To use this command within Word for Windows and still be prompted to save any
changes made during the current session, you can use an AutoExit macro, like the
following, to exit Windows when you exit Word for Windows. The AutoExit macro
runs each time you close Word for Windows.

      Sub AutoExit
         Tasks.ExitWindows
      End Sub
