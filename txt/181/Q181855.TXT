SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to start any .exe or FoxPro program from a Hot Key
within an application or from the Windows Desktop under either Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Customers often want to enter an application more quickly or open additional
applications from within FoxPro like Calc.exe (the Windows calculator program)
or Winword.exe. This method can also be used to open unrelated Help files or
Docs Online without searching the Desktop or folders.

The following steps can be used to open most programs with hot keys.

WARNING: Hot Keys are global and may interfere with other applications' Hot
Keys.

1. Click the Windows Start button.

2. Highlight Settings and then select Taskbar.

3. In the Taskbar Properties dialog box select the Start Menu Programs tab.

4. Click the Advanced button.

5. Click the "+" to expand the Programs Folder, if required, under the Start
   Menu folder.

6. Open the folder of your choice.

7. Right-click a short cut, select Properties and then select the Shortcut tab.

8. Click inside the Shortcut Key text box and press CTRL+ALT+A.

9. Click the Apply button and then click OK.

10. Close all open windows and use the Hot Key to open an application.

NOTE: This Hot Key will be global throughout Windows.
