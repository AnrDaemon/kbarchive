SUMMARY
=======

Vcache is a caching utility made by Golden Bow that is similar to Microsoft's
SMARTDRV.SYS. To run effectively with Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode or to run on
a network in all modes, special parameters are required on the Vcache command
line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Windows 3.0 is being run on a standalone machine in enhanced mode or in any
mode on a network, the Vcache default parameter T=2 will need to be disabled and
set to T=0,(delayed writes = off) to allow normal printing operations. This
switch is effective for Vcache versions 3.x through 5.06.

According to Golden Bow, this parameter change is necessary because printing and
background transfer operations being initiated by Vcache cannot be detected by
either Windows or the networking software.

Using Vcache AT with Windows 2.x
--------------------------------

Vcache AT is not compatible with some earlier versions of Windows. For example,
running Vcache AT with Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, or 2.11 generates a fatal
exit code. The solution is to replace Vcache with the SMARTDRV.SYS file found on
the Windows disks.
