-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks and the Microsoft Mail
Gateway to Fax, the following error message may be displayed:

   Unable to connect to modem. Sending and Receiving turned off. Error -2005.

CAUSE
=====

This is a standard time-out error that is returned when the fax/modem does not
respond to commands from the FaxINIT. This message can be caused by one of the
following problems:

 - The fax modem is not turned on or is not connected correctly.

 - An incorrect FaxINIT is being used for the fax/modem.

 - There is a serial port contention. Some other software is attempting to use
   the same serial port as the fax gateway. The fax gateway is configured to
   only use the modem port.

 - Running on an AppleShare file server sometimes causes this problem if there
   is heavy server activity. Intense network activity can cause enough of a
   delay in the FaxINIT-fax/modem communications to cause an error.

 - There may be various INIT conflicts. Try changing the load order of the INITs
   or removing unnecessary INITs.

 - Running fax gateway on a Mac IIfx without the IIfx Serial Switch. This is a
   Control Panel device from Apple, which must be set to Compatible.
