SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows 3.1 and 3.11 Setup program requires spaces between command
line switches.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use command line switches to pass parameters to the Windows Setup
program, you must use a space to separate the switches. If you don't use a
space, Setup interprets multiple switches as one switch.

The following example illustrates the results of the incorrect use of command
line switches.

   SETUP /B/I   Setup executes in B&W mode but still detects hardware.
   SETUP /I/B   Setup doesn't detect hardware but executes in color.

The following examples demonstrate the correct use of command line switches:

   SETUP /I     Setup executes ignoring hardware.
   SETUP /B     Setup executes in B&W mode.

   SETUP /B /I  Setup executes in B&W mode and does not detect hardware.
   SETUP /I /B  Setup does not detect hardware, and executes in B&W mode.
