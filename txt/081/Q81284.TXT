SUMMARY
=======

Windows may encounter some problems when running on a computer system configured
with an Intel 386 SnapIn. The following are some of the most common situations:

 - Windows returns to the command line after trying to load.

   -or-

 - The error message "Cannot file or load specific file" is received.

   -or-

 - Windows cannot be run in enhanced mode.

This information applies to Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 and Windows versions 3.0
and 3.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Windows is having a problem operating on a system equipped with an Intel
SnapIn 386, check the following:

1. Make sure Windows has been reinstalled after SnapIn 386 was added to the
   system. This makes sure the 386 specific files necessary for enhanced mode
   operation are copied to the hard drive. NOTE: This case alone is the most
   common cause for the error message "Cannot file or load specific file."

2. Add VirtualHDIRQ=off to the 386ENH section of the SYSTEM.INI file. This will
   enable certain hard disk controller interrupts to go through the ROM routine
   that handles those interrupts, instead of being controlled by Windows when
   running in enhanced mode.

3. If SMARTDRV.SYS is loading, add the parameter /b+ to the end of the
   SMARTDRV.SYS command line in the CONFIG.SYS file. The /b+ parameter forces
   the double buffering capability of the SMARTDRV.SYS disk cache to be
   installed. The line would look similar to the following example:

         DEVICE=[drive:][path]\SMARTDRV.SYS 1024 512 /B+

   Warning: It is also possible to use the /b- parameter, which disables the
   double buffering capabilities of SMARTDRV.SYS. However, if there is a Bus
   Master board present in the system and the /b- parameter is used, Data
   corruption may occur.

4. Check for memory conflicts. If there are expansion boards in the system that
   occupy memory address space (network boards, emulation boards, and so on),
   add an EMMEXCLUDE= statement to the 386ENH section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
   Exclude the range to cover the memory address of the expansion board. The
   line would look similar to the following example:

         EMMEXCLUDE=A000-EFFF

NOTE: On an Intel SnapIn 386 equipped system running MS-DOS 5.0, SMARTDRV.SYS
looks at the system ID byte and sees a 286. It then assumes that Windows cannot
be run in enhanced mode. Because SnapIn 386 allows these systems to run in 386
enhanced mode, you must make the adjustments above to ensure stable operation.

SnapIn 386 is manufactured by Intel, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
