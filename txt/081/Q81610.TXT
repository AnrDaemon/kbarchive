SUMMARY
=======

Ecovrwrt.exe is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how an
application can implement a multiline edit control in which the user can toggle
between "insert" mode and "overwrite" mode. In insert mode, new text pushes any
existing text further to the right. In overwrite mode, new text replaces any
existing text.

To implement overwrite mode, Ecovrwrt.exe subclasses the multiline edit control.
When the control is in overwrite mode, when the control receives a WM_CHAR
message, the character after the selection point is selected and replaced with
the character in the wParam of the message.
