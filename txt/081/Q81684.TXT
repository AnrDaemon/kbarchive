The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Maximizer memory manager (MAXIMIZE.COM) is incompatible with Microsoft
Windows versions 3.1 and 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Maximizer is a memory manager that provides upper memory block (UMB) support
for loading devices into the upper memory area (UMA). Initial testing of Windows
3.1 has shown the Maximizer to be incompatible with Windows. The Maximizer
causes the Windows 3.1 Setup program to fail. If Windows 3.1 is successfully
installed, Windows fails to run in standard or enhanced mode if the Maximizer is
loaded with UMB support enabled.

NOTE: The Maximizer comes with a version of HIMEM.SYS that is older than the
HIMEM.SYS file that ships with Windows 3.1. Microsoft recommends using HIMEM.SYS
version 3.0, which is shipped with Windows 3.1.

The Maximizer product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
