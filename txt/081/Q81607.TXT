SUMMARY
=======

If a command that causes the computer to reboot is used in a batch file while
SMARTDRV.EXE is loaded, the following command should precede the reboot
command:

      SMARTDRV.EXE /C

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMARTDRV.EXE writes data to the disk in the background. Normally, the cache (or
buffer) that contains this information is flushed when there is a brief pause in
activity. However, in a batch file, there is no significant pause between
commands, so it is not possible for SMARTDRV.EXE to flush its cache before a
reboot command is given. This can result in data loss. To correct this problem,
you must explicitly tell SMARTDRV.EXE to flush its cache. This is done by
executing SMARTDRV.EXE with the /C parameter as shown above.

For more information on a program that will reboot the computer from a batch
file, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
