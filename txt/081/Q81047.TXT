SUMMARY
=======

Windows version 3.1 supports a drag-drop protocol that enables an application to
be the client of File Manager. When an application implements the drag-drop
feature, a user can select one or more files in File Manager, drag them to a
client application, and drop them. At this point, the client application
receives a message and it can determine which files were dropped and the exact
location at which the files were dropped.

At present, version 3.1 of the File Manager is the only server application that
supports the drag-drop protocol. Although no Windows function is available to
enable an application to become a drag-drop server, Microsoft intends to provide
this functionality in a future release of Windows.

The drag-drop interface mechanism will change to provide additional functionality
that can be used by a future server application to support application
cooperation and shell integration. The new mechanism will continue to support
the Windows 3.1 drag-drop client protocol.
