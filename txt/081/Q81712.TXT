printers and the Big Kiss laser printer with Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PS-810, PS-1500, and PS-820
---------------------------

If you use Windows version 2.x, 3.0, or 3.0a with the QMS PostScript printer
PS-810, PS-1500, or PS-820, use the PSCRIPT.DRV printer driver.

NOTE: The dual-bin capability of these printers is not supported by the
PSCRIPT.DRV driver.

   -----------     -----------------------------------------

   QMS PS-1500     Apple LaserWriter Plus

   QMS PS-820      QMS-PS 800 Plus,
       PS-810      Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet Plus, or
                   HP7475a plotter

QMS also distributes its own PostScript driver for Windows 3.0. This driver dated
11/03/93, must be used with the QMS PS-2200 and is available from QMS technical
support.

Using the Big Kiss Laser Printer with Windows
---------------------------------------------

The Big Kiss laser printer supports Epson FX-80 emulation. If the Big Kiss is
using ROM version 3.0 or later, it supports Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
emulation.

If you have ROM version 3.0, you can check the startup page, which is printed
when you turn on the printer, to determine what emulation mode the printer is
using. Under Windows 3.0, 3.0a, or 3.1, install the printer driver that
corresponds with the emulation mode the printer is set to use. If you do not
have ROM version 3.0, you can obtain an update by contacting QMS technical
support. Ask for the parts department and order the "Big Kiss ROM Upgrade."

The Kiss Plus also supports the same HP LaserJet and Epson emulation modes. The
printer needs the Kiss Module 20, 30, or 40 to support HP LaserJet emulation. If
you have Module 10, you can either upgrade the ROM, or install the Epson FX-80
printer driver for Windows 3.0.

The Big Kiss II supports the Epson FX-80 emulation only. This is because the HP
LaserJet emulation does not support two paper trays.
