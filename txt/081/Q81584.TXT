======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run an MS-DOS virtual machine (VM) in a window in Microsoft Windows 3.0
enhanced mode, and you receive a Novell broadcast message through NWPOPUP, your
keyboard may lock up.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs in Windows 3.0 running in 386 enhanced mode. It occurs
because MS-DOS-based applications cannot run in a window when Windows 3.0 is
running in real or standard mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Press the ALT+ENTER keys to place the MS-DOS-based application into
   full-screen mode.

2. Press the ALT+ENTER keys a second time to return the application to a window.

This reactivates the keyboard for use in the MS-DOS virtual machine.

If ESC and CTRL+BREAK are the only keys affected by the broadcast message, then
press the ALT+TAB key combination twice to reactivate the keys.

STATUS
======

Microsoft and Novell are researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
