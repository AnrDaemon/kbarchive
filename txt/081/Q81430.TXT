SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows, it is possible to remove an installed printer driver from
the Control Panel Printers dialog box (including an active printer), while
printing, once Print Manager has returned control.

Although the printer driver is removed from the Control Panel Printers dialog
box, the in-progress print job will be completed successfully.

NOTE: The in-progress job will fail if the printer driver is deleted or removed
from the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. Any subsequent attempts to print to the
removed printer, will fail until the printer driver is reinstalled.
