SUMMARY
=======

The Windows 3.0 PIF Editor on-screen Help program incorrectly documents the
Program Filename box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Pressing F1 while the cursor is in the Program Filename box brings up the Help
file for that topic. The last paragraph gives instructions on running other
commands or terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs before loading an
application.

Help displays:

   * Create MP.BAT (with a text editor) and make the last command
     MP.PIF

However, when this batch file is run, MS-DOS gives the error message

   Bad command or file name.

MS-DOS does not recognize the PIF extension as a valid executable filename.

Solution
--------

To correct this problem, remove FILENAME.PIF from the batch file.
