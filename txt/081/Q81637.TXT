-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use a Windows-supported driver, PostScript-generated output always
starts and ends with a CTRL+D (ASCII 04) key sequence.

CTRL+D is an end-of-file (EOF) reset code used to ensure that the printer is set
correctly for the next print job. However, this character can cause a job not to
print through UNIX-based networks (for example, Banyan VINES, AT&T Star
Group, and Sun) and other printing-control software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow the appropriate procedure below to allow your print job to finish.

Windows 3.1 and 3.11
--------------------

1. Edit the WIN.INI file [ModelName,Port] section with an ASCII text editor,
   such as Windows Notepad.

   NOTE: When you install a PostScript printer for the first time, you must go
   into Printer Setup in Control Panel for this setting to work correctly.
   Simply installing the printer is not enough. The [ModelName,Port] section is
   not written into the WIN.INI file until you choose the Setup button in the
   Printers area of Control Panel.

2. Add the following:

   " CTRLD=0" (without the quotation marks)

   NOTE: The Options menu in the PostScript printer driver allows you to create
   encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files. These files do not contain CTRL+D
   characters. EPS files do not contain any of the printer-specific instruction
   codes, which are sometimes necessary, that a PostScript file does. EPS files
   are primarily intended to be graphics or other output that is imported into
   another application and not printed directly.

Windows 3.0 and 3.0a
--------------------

The only way to eliminate the CTRL+D character from the PostScript file is to
create a PRN file, then load it into a text editor and manually remove the
character.
