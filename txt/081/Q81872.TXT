SUMMARY
=======

Nommdll.exe is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how to
determine whether the Multimedia Extensions to Microsoft Windows and its
associated drivers are installed. NOMMDLL has two parts: the PLAYWAV application
and the PLYSND dynamic-link library (DLL).

PLAYWAV indicates that the Multimedia Extensions are installed when its Sound
menu option is available. When this menu item is grayed or unavailable, the
Extensions are not installed. By default, PLAYWAV also determines if the sound
driver is loaded. You can modify the code to look for other drivers if desired.

An application can use the PLYSND DLL to play sounds. The functions in PLYSND are
useful to control the Media Control Interface (MCI).
