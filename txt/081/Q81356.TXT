TITLE   :BUG: QuickHelp /t Option Is Not Implemented
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.7,1.83
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft QuickHelp for MS-DOS, versions 1.7, 1.83 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft QuickHelp Utility versions 1.7 and 1.83, the /t command
line option does not work correctly. This option allows the user to directly
paste the Help information requested into the specified paste file. However, the
option has not been implemented.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickHelp versions 1.7 and 1.83.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To duplicate this problem, enter the following command at the command prompt:

   " QH /t printf " (without the quotation marks)

This should copy the Help screen for printf into the default paste file (PASTE.QH
in the directory that the TMP environment variable is pointing to). However,
when viewing that directory, the file will not exist (this file will not be
changed if it already existed in that directory).

Additional query words: QH quick help
