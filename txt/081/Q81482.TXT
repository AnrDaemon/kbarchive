======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you print with a Tandy 2102 dot-matrix printer with the IBM ProPrinter XL24
emulation in Microsoft Windows 3.0, the resulting output may appear as lines of
sixes (66666, etc.) or other random characters.

Output from the MS-DOS level appears normal.

CAUSE
=====

You are using a generic or an IBM parallel printing cable. This occurs because
the cable, by design or modification, has pin 33 disabled. Windows uses this pin
to help control printing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain a new Tandy Parallel Printer cable (catalog
#26-0227). A possible workaround is to use the LPT1.OS2 port.
