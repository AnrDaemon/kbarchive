SUMMARY
=======

When you run an application in a console window, you can press ALT+ENTER to
switch the console into full screen view. The application running in the console
window is displayed in full screen.

NOTE: ALT+ENTER only switches to full screen on x86 machines.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A console is a window that appears to run character-based applications from
Windows NT, MS-DOS, or OS/2. When you start a character-based application in a
console (for example, CMD.EXE), the application runs in the current console
(unless you start it with the "start" command). If you start a Windows 32-bit or
16-bit application, it starts on the desktop.

To switch back and forth between a console and a full screen, press ALT+ENTER
when the application has the focus.
