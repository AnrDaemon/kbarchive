TITLE   :Windows Err Msg: File Already Exists. Overwrite? (File Mgr)

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to rename or copy files from Microsoft Windows File Manager, and
you use a wild card as the extension (for example, XXX.*), the following error
message is displayed:

   File already Exists. Overwrite?

WORKAROUND
==========

Rename or copy the files from MS-DOS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
This problem was corrected and does not occur in later Windows versions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Renaming or copying a specified file or group of files with a wild card
extension, while changing the base or prefix name, should be possible in Windows
3.0. For example, if a specified source file is indicated as "XXX.*" (without
the quotation marks) and the destination file is specified as "YYY.*" (without
the quotation marks), every file that begins with XXX should be changed or
copied to a filename with a YYY base or prefix. However, in File Manager, this
only works if the destination base name (prefix) is one character long (for
example, Y.*).

This procedure works if executed from MS-DOS, but File Manager cannot complete
the procedure properly.
