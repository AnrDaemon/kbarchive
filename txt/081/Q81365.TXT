SYMPTOMS
========

When using Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1, you can save
macros in the TOOLS.INI file. However, when the following macro is saved in
TOOLS.INI, PWB will not correctly evaluate the macro commands.

      mytab: Alt+K

CAUSE
=====

When using the select function in macros, PWB sometimes gives unexpected
results.

RESOLUTION
==========

When recording the above macro through the Record On option under the PWB Edit
menu, the macro will work as expected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB versions 1.0 and 1.1. This
problem was corrected in PWB version 2.0.
