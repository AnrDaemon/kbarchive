TITLE   :BUG: BIND Error U1253 Opening DOSCALLS.LIB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN compiler for OS/2, version 5.1 
 - Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler for MS-DOS, version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to create a bound executable file fails and the BIND utility produces
the following message:

   BIND : fatal error U1253: cannot open file : DOSCALLS.LIB

CAUSE
=====

When the compiler command line specifies the /Fb compiler option switch to
create a bound executable file, the FORTRAN compiler passes the name
"DOSCALLS.LIB" to the BIND utility. The error occurs because DOSCALLS.LIB is not
provided with FORTRAN version 5.1. The functions are provided in the OS2.LIB
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To address this error, perform one of the following two steps:

1. Copy the OS2.LIB file to the DOSCALLS.LIB file in the FORTRAN libraries
   directory.

-or-

2. Link the application with the appropriate protected-mode library, then
   explicitly call the BIND utility.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with FORTRAN version 5.1 for OS/2.

This is not a problem in FORTRAN PowerStation.
