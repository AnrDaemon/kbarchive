PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Windows accessory applications (Write, Notepad, Paintbrush, and so
on) cannot print.

CAUSE
=====

A compressed or otherwise invalid Windows printer driver corresponding to the
default printer is in the Windows directory.

NOTE: Applications not located in the Windows directory do not demonstrate this
problem.

For example, if the current default printer is a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
II, and HPPCL.DRV is in the Windows directory in compressed format, none of the
accessory applications can print. In addition, you can't choose the Setup button
from the Printer Setup dialog box (on the File menu in each accessory
application).

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete the compressed driver file from the Windows directory and make sure an
uncompressed version is in the Windows SYSTEM directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

following symptoms:

Notepad, Cardfile, Calendar
