SUMMARY
=======

BkGnd.exe is a sample in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how to
use a PeekMessage() loop to perform background processing. There are often times
when it is necessary for an application to execute a time consuming process such
as printing, file I/O, and math calculations in the background. Doing so allows
the Windows environment to continue to service other applications while
completing a lengthy process.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The BKGND sample application uses the WaitMessage() function, which allows the
application to "sleep" when the background process is complete. In the sample,
the user determines when background processing starts and ends. In a production
application, an application would probably determine when background processing
was required.
