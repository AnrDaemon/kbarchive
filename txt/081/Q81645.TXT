======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install BlueMAX, your system may stop responding (hang) or you may
experience data corruption. The following error message may be displayed:

   Divide overflow
   Memory allocation error
   Cannot load COMMAND, system halted

CAUSE
=====

These problems are caused by changes to the CONFIG.SYS file made by the BlueMAX
installation program. BlueMAX does not detect the presence of SMARTDRV.EXE, and
installs ts own disk cache called Qcache. Then, the BlueMAX installation
attempts to load the double buffering option of SMARTDRV.EXE high if a device
line for device portion of SMARTDRV.EXE exists in the CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two basic problems caused by the BlueMAX installation program.

 - Using more than one disk cache can cause data corruption and system hangs.
   Microsoft recommends that SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0 be used with Microsoft
   Windows.

 - In addition to installing its own disk cache, BlueMAX attempts to load the
   double buffering portion of SMARTDRV.EXE high if a device line for
   SMARTDRV.EXE exists in the CONFIG.SYS file. The following is an example of
   the double buffering driver being loaded low, into conventional memory:

   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER

The device portion of SMARTDRV.EXE loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file allows
SMARTDRV.EXE to function correctly with basic input/output systems (BIOS) older
than three years. SMARTDRV.EXE displays an error message if it is loaded high
and the /DOUBLE_BUFFER switch is used. The BlueMAX load high driver cannot
correctly handle SMARTDRV.EXE's error message and may display the error message
noted above.

NOTE: This message can also be caused by too little hard disk space. This can
occur when exiting Windows or an application, such as Microsoft Excel. If you
are using a permanent swap file, you need to have a minimum of 4 MB of available
disk space; if you are using a temporary swap file, you need to have a minimum
of 9 MB of available disk space. Also, be sure that you have a valid TEMP
directory.
