-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Windows in enhanced mode with Artisoft LANtastic 4.x,
Windows stops responding (hangs) after displaying the Windows logo.

CAUSE
=====

When you run Windows in enhanced mode with LANtastic 4.x, the LANTASTI.386 file
must be located in a directory that is included in the MS-DOS PATH= environment
variable. If it is not, Windows cannot load properly.

The problem does not occur if the network software has not been started before
running Windows, or if you are running Windows in another mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type

   path

to display the current value of PATH. PATH is usually set in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. If LANTASTI.386 is not in a directory on the PATH= line, either copy it to
a directory that is in the PATH= or add its directory to the PATH.
