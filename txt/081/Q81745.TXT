The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) returns both the fixed disk parameters (drive type,
cylinders, sectors) and the CMOS fixed disk parameters for each logical drive.
The CMOS fixed disk parameters are correct for the primary MS-DOS partition
only, and can be ignored for each logical drive in the extended partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CMOS fixed disk parameters are only accurate for the primary partition. The
CMOS information for each logical drive of the extended partition containsfalse
values. This is a result of the MS-DOS partitioning scheme and the way partition
information is stored.
