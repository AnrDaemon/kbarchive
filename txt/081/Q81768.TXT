======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Windows Setup from MS-DOS and attempting to change display drivers,
you may receive the following message:

   !ERROR BUILDING WIN.COM!
   F3 = Exit

There is no way to bypass this message.

CAUSE
=====

This message is due to Setup's inability to alter the WIN.COM file to reflect
the change in display drivers.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the MS-DOS command ATTRIB or a third-party utility program to remove any
read-only attributes from WIN.COM. This allows Setup to modify WIN.COM and make
the requested change. The only attribute WIN.COM should have is "A" (that is,
Archive).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This information applies to Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a; it does not
apply to later versions of Windows.
