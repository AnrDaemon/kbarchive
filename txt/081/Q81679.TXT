======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you set up the JukeBox program (JUKEBOX.EXE) that comes with the Sound
Blaster I card, the following error message may be displayed:

   The Sound Blaster cannot be installed. Please check your WIN.INI settings.

CAUSE
=====

The Sound Blaster I JukeBox program is not compatible with Microsoft Windows
version 3.1.

This version of JukeBox does not use the Multimedia Extensions. It uses a custom
DLL file called SNDBLST.DLL and assumes that it has complete control over the Ad
Lib synthesizer. This causes problems with the Microsoft Multimedia Ad Lib
driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is another version of the JukeBox application called MMJBOX.EXE that uses
the Microsoft Multimedia Extensions MCI sequencer. To obtain a copy of
MMJBOX.EXE, please contact Creative Labs.
