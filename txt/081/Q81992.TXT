TITLE   :PRB: Two Builds of Same Windows Help File Not Identical
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Help (.HLP) files generated from the same RTF source with the same version of
the Windows Help Compiler are not identical. Even though the files work
identically, a binary comparison of the file reveals differences.

CAUSE
=====

Each Help file contains a time stamp indicating the compilation time, and
contains buffers that have some uninitialized data.

STATUS
======

This behavior results from design decisions made regarding Windows Help and is
unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 HC HC.EXE
