SUMMARY
=======

Several Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers limit the number of fonts allowed per
page. The information below explains the limits and which printers are affected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HP LaserJet III
---------------

The number of fonts per page for the HP LaserJet Series III printer is limited
only by available printer memory.

HP LaserJet-Compatible Printers
-------------------------------

HPPCL-supported printers, such as the HP LaserJet Plus, HP LaserJet 500 Plus, HP
LaserJet Series II, and other HP LaserJet-compatible printers are limited to 16
fonts per page. There is no limit on the number of fonts that can be used per
document. However, if you send a page that has more than 16 fonts to an HP
printer, you receive the following message:

   PCL PRINTING WARNING: SOFT FONT PAGE LIMIT: Some fonts will be substituted

Choosing the OK button allows printing to continue. This limitation applies to
all fonts. Note also that using one font with 17 different pitches causes the
same error.

Original HP LaserJet Printer
----------------------------

The original HP LaserJet has a built-in limitation of eight fonts per page. You
also cannot download soft fonts to an original HP LaserJet.

For more information on the capabilities of the HP LaserJet family of printers,
contact Hewlett-Packard.
