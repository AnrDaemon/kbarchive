-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can configure the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Gateway to Fax to
send a cover page with each fax transmission. You need to first create a cover
page using any non-PostScript application that has printing capabilities.

1. Leave the top 2 to 3 inches of the document blank because transmission
   information is placed at the top of the page when a cover page is used.

2. In the Chooser, select MailSender.

3. Print the document. When the MailSender print dialog opens, click the Save
   File radio button.

4. When the "Save Image File As" dialog appears, click the Formats button and
   select "FAXGATE Cover Page" from the list of formats. Save the file and copy
   it to the master fax gateway server's hard disk where it will be safe from
   accidental deletion.

5. At the Macintosh serving as the master fax gateway server, sign into Mail as
   the Network Manager.

6. Choose Gateway Accounts from the Mail menu and click the Modify radio button.

7. Select a gateway account.

8. Click the Cover Page button and select any cover page file that you have
   previously created. Each gateway account can have a unique cover page
   assigned to it. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 to set the cover page for other gateway
   accounts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Mail for AppleTalk Networks
Gateway to Fax. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The cover page is rasterized at 200x200 dpi on the Macintosh on which it is
printed with MailSender. To achieve the best looking results, use TrueType or
ATM font scaling programs to create the cover page.

Because the cover page is rasterized at 200x200 dpi, a cover page will not be
sent when the Fastest resolution option is selected, which is 200x100 dpi. No
warning is given when the account is configured this way.
