SUMMARY
=======

If Microsoft Windows is running on a pen-only machine without a keyboard, it is
not possible to get past the text-based warning if a permanent swap file becomes
corrupted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The corrupted swap file warning is a text-based warning that prompts you to
respond with yes/no keyboard input. If this error message is received on a true
pen-only machine with no keyboard, it is not possible to reply because the
Windows 3.1 Pen Extensions are not loaded.

To get past the warning message, turn off the machine, plug in a keyboard, and
turn the machine back on. This allows the yes/no text-based warning to be
answered. Once you have entered Windows 3.1, you can use the pen to delete the
permanent swap file and create a new one.
