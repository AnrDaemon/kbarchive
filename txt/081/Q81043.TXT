SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Flight Simulator for the Macintosh version 4.0, some of the runways
at Oakland International Airport may disappear while flying at low altitudes.
Specifically, while flying at an altitude of less than 107 feet over runway
9R/27R, all runways other than 9R/27R will disappear. After passing over and
leaving the vicinity of this runway, all other runways will reappear.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

Additional query words: 9R/27R 4.00
