SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) and
the Remote Workstation client require the Modem's Auto Answer feature to be
turned off. These programs poll the serial port looking for a ring signal that
prevents the client from incurring phone costs due to invalid or unsuccessful
connections (such as when the External Mail program is down or busy).
