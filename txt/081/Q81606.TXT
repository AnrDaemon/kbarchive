TITLE   :Disabling the Startup Group in Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To disable the Startup group when starting Microsoft Windows version 3.1, do the
following:

1. Start Windows as usual. (At the MS-DOS command prompt, type "WIN" (without
   the quotation marks) and press the ENTER key.)

2. Immediately after pressing ENTER, press and hold down the SHIFT key.

To start Windows 95 without processing the Startup folder, press and hold down
the SHIFT key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message. This also prevents
programs from being run by the "Load=" and the "Run=" lines listed in the
Win.ini file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At Windows startup, Program Manager executes all programs that have an icon in
the Startup group. The programs are executed according to their placement in the
Startup group, with Windows applications taking precedence over MS-DOS
applications. Windows starts executing from the upper left and goes across to
the right and then down one line.

NOTE: The Startup group is independent of the LOAD= and RUN= lines in the WIN.INI
file.

You can also disable the Startup group by putting the line "startup=" (without
the quotation marks) in the [settings] section of your PROGMAN.INI file. If you
leave this entry blank (that is, you don't put anything on the right side of the
equals sign), there is no Startup group.

For more information on the application load order for programs in the Startup
group, refer to article Q91204 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
