SYMPTOMS
========

When you display a 256-color bitmap in Microsoft Windows Paintbrush, the
wallpaper color may change to a different shade. In addition, the wallpaper
color behind some icons may change significantly when you run Windows with a
256-color display driver.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by rotating color palettes. The color of the wallpaper
changes somewhat because Paintbrush realizes a palette that conflicts with the
one required by the wallpaper. Windows performs a "best match" to match the
colors after the palette has changed.

Some icons on the desktop may have background colors that do not match the
background at all. Control Panel and Program Manager icons, for example, may
display with incorrect background colors. Dr. Watson, however, displays the
correct background color. Dr. Watson repaints its icon when the new palette is
selected by Paintbrush; however, Control Panel and Program Manager do not.
