The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

PC Guardian is not fully compatible with Microsoft Windows. There are three
known incompatibilities:

 - The program authentication module of Virus Protection detects any changes
   made to .COM or .EXE files. This mode of PC Guardian causes the Windows Setup
   program to stop (hang).

 - If Windows is successfully installed, it isn't able to run successfully in
   enhanced mode.

 - The virus protection module of PC Guardian has a utility called SUSPMSW.EXE.
   This utility attempts to lock the keyboard in Windows after a preset time
   period. When SUSPMSW.EXE is executed, it causes Windows to enter a continuous
   loop of Cancel/Retry error messages, effectively hanging Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are a few of the PC Guardian terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
