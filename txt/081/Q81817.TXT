TITLE   :SuperStor Changes RAMDrive Letter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0,5.0a

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When AddStor's SuperStor program is installed and the MS-DOS device driver
RAMDRIVE.SYS or DRIVER.SYS is loaded, the reported drive letter from
RAMDRIVE.SYS is off by one drive letter.

CAUSE
=====

SuperStor loads a device driver called SSTORDRV.SYS that uses the next available
drive letter for its own use. When RAMDRIVE.SYS is loaded after SuperStor is
loaded, RAMDRIVE.SYS reports that it is set up as drive Z, when it is really
drive Y.

For example, if your system has one physical hard drive (drive C) when SuperStor
loads, SuperStor uses drive D. When RAMDRIVE.SYS loads, it uses drive letter E.
However, RAMDRIVE.SYS reports that it is set up as drive F, even though it is
really drive E.

Add Stor is aware of this problem. There are no adverse effects from the missing
drive letter, other than confusion it may cause you.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, load RAMDRIVE.SYS before the SuperStor driver
(SSTORDRV.SYS).

If you load RAMDRIVE.SYS before the SSTORDRV.SYS driver, the SuperStor drive
letter is then off by one rather than RAMDrive. But because you don't need to
access the SuperStor drive, it should pose no problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SuperStor is a disk storage maximizer similar to Stacker.
