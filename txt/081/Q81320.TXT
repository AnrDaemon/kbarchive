======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Windows version 3.0 is installed with a serial mouse on the
following machines

   KLH 386 Model 215
   KLH 286 Model 195
   Premier 286 Model 1400

the following problems may occur:

 - If the Microsoft Or IBM PS/2 option is selected for the pointing device, the
   mouse pointer remains frozen in the middle of the screen.

 - If the MouseSystems Or (VisiOn On ComX) option is selected for the pointing
   device, the mouse pointer will disappear as soon as it is moved.

CAUSE
=====

These problems occur because the above computers have a built-in bus mouse port
and the motherboard is set to access this port by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disabling the built-in bus port by setting DIP switch number 3 to OFF on the
motherboard of these machines corrects the above problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a bus mouse is being used, no problems should occur.

The three machines above are referred to as "Revision 1" machines and are no
longer in production.
