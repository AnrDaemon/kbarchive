SUMMARY
=======

When a mouse driver is removed from Microsoft Windows, Windows requires that the
NOMOUSE.DRV driver be installed. This driver tells Windows that a mouse is not
present. This is necessary because Windows requires a driver to be associated
with the "Mouse.drv=" line in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. During
startup, Windows takes the following actions depending on what it finds in the
"Mouse.drv=" line:

 - If the Mouse.drv= line does not have an entry after the equal (=) sign,
   Windows exits to an MS-DOS command prompt.

 - If the Mouse.drv= line is missing from the SYSTEM.INI file, Windows looks in
   the Windows and system directories and the path. If there is a MOUSE.DRV file
   there, then it uses it, regardless of file date or size.

 - If there is no MOUSE.DRV file, then Windows exits to an MS-DOS command
   prompt.

Windows does not search for the following mouse drivers:

   NOMOUSE.DRV
   LMOUSE.DRV
   MSMOUSE.DRV
   MSMOUSE2.DRV

MORE INFORMATION
