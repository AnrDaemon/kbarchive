SUMMARY
=======

Playcd.exe is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how an
application developed for Microsoft Windows can play a music CD (compact disk)
in a CD-ROM (compact disk read-only memory) drive. Playcd.exe has two parts: the
PLAYCD application and the PLYCD dynamic-link library (DLL).

The Playcd.exe application does very little by itself. It calls functions in the
PLYCD DLL to play the CD.

The PLYCD DLL contains code to control the CD-ROM player. PLYCD includes
functions to play the CD, pause, move forward and backward by tracks, determine
the position within the CD, and eject the CD from the drive. PLYCD interacts
with the Media Control Interface (MCI) using the mciSendCommand() API.
