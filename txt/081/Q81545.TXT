KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Adding the lines shown below to your TOOLS.INI file will allow you to execute a
Rebuild All, Build Target, Compile, Run Program, or Debug Program with macros in
Programmers WorkBench (PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1. These lines should be placed
after the pwb tag [pwb] in the TOOLS.INI file.

This information applies to PWB 2.0 as well, except that a program list does not
need to be set for the macros to work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For the function keys to work as expected, a program list must first be set
within PWB. For more information on PWB macros, consult the documentation and
online help included with your version of the compiler or assembler. The
"Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench" application note also contains additional
information on PWB and is available from Microsoft Product Support. Query on
SW0330 to learn more about this application note.
