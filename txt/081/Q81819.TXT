 - DELTREE

 - DISKCOMP

 - DISKCOPY

 - DOSKEY

 - FIND

 - MOVE

 - MSAV (codes defined in versions 6.0 and later)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Any program in the MS-DOS environment can set an exit value that can be detected
with IF ERRORLEVEL. Any MS-DOS command can return a value, but only the above
commands have exit codes defined in the MS-DOS specifications. Return values
from other commands should not be relied upon, as they may be different for
different versions and dialects of MS-DOS.

None of the internal MS-DOS commands have defined return codes. An external
command is a separate MS-DOS program; internal commands are contained within
COMMAND.COM and are always available for use when the MS-DOS prompt is active.

You can determine if a command is internal or external by checking your MS-DOS
documentation. In MS-DOS 5.0 and 5.0a, commands are marked as internal or
external in the chart that accompanies each command in Chapter 14 of the
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference" manual. Earlier versions of the
manual include a boxed E or I symbol on the upper outside corner of the page to
denote external or internal.

Customers have suggested that exit codes be defined for all appropriate MS-DOS
commands (both internal and external). This feature is under review and will be
considered for inclusion in a future release.
