TITLE   :PRB: VGA Monitor Loses Sync on 8514 Dual Monitor System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a system equipped with both an 8514 and a VGA monitor, when the user uses
ALT+ENTER to switch the display from a full screen MS-DOS prompt to a windowed
MS-DOS prompt, the VGA monitor loses synchronization.

CAUSE
=====

Windows does not change the settings for the registers of the VGA card.

RESOLUTION
==========

Load the ANSI.SYS device driver by adding the following line to CONFIG.SYS:

   device=c:\dos\ansi.sys

Then, place a command into the WINSTART.BAT file to initialize the settings of
the VGA card as Windows starts. Create or modify a WINSTART.BAT in the Windows
directory (by default, C:\WINDOWS). To place the VGA monitor into 50-line mode,
add the following line to the WINSTART.BAT file:

   @MODE 80,50

To place the monitor into 25 line mode, add the following line to the
WINSTART.BAT file:

   @MODE 80,25
