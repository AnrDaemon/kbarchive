PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The debugging version of Microsoft Windows version 3.1 writes the following
notification to the debugging terminal:

   Segment was discardable under 3.0

CAUSE
=====

One or more code segments of a dynamic-link library (DLL) are marked MOVEABLE
and are not marked DISCARDABLE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the module definition (.DEF) file for the DLL to mark all MOVEABLE code
segments as DISCARDABLE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Windows version 3.0, MOVEABLE code segments in a DLL are DISCARDABLE by
default. This behavior changes under Windows 3.1; segments must be marked
DISCARDABLE to be discarded. The debug notification highlights the change in
behavior between the two versions of Windows.
