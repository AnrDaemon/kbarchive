SUMMARY
=======

When landing at Oakland International Airport and looking toward San Francisco,
there is a black building that appears at the foot of the hill. The heading
toward this building is North 17365 and East 05104 toward the compass heading of

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Flight Simulator
