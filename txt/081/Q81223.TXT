TITLE   :FIX: Animated Button Custom Control: Caption May Be Truncated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Caption property of the Animated Button custom control allows up to 255
characters to be entered, but only displays a varying number of those
characters. The number of characters displayed depends on the FontSize and the
width of the characters. The larger the font, or the wider the characters, the
less the number of characters that will appear in the caption.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, make the font for the caption as small as feasible,
and whenever possible, use the smallest size of characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Animated Button custom control
provided with the products listed above. This problem was corrected in Animated
Button custom control provided with Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N) if
   Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select the
   ANIBUTTON.VBX custom control file. The Animated Button tool will appear in
   the toolbox.

3. Place an Animated Button control on Form1.

4. From the Properties list box, select the Caption property for the Animated
   Button control. Enter 255 W characters. Notice that the caption of the
   Animated Button control is now filled with W characters.

5. Maximize Form1 by clicking the maximize button in the upper-right corner of
   Form1.

6. Stretch the right side of the Animated Button control so that you can see the
   whole caption. (To do this, click the control, and pull the handle on the
   right side of the control.)

If you change the W characters to I characters, you will be able see more of the
characters in the caption before they are truncated because I characters takes
proportionately less space than W characters.
