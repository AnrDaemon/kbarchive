TITLE   :Sound Recorder Does Not Save As with a Default Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You save a new file in Microsoft Windows Sound Recorder, but it doesn't appear
in the Sound Recorder file list.

CAUSE
=====

Sound Recorder doesn't automatically append its default extension (.WAV) when
you save a file. If you don't specify the filename with extension, the file is
saved without an extension and it isn't listed in the file list box when you
open files from Sound Recorder. In addition, the file has no association to
Sound Recorder.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you save a recorded sound under a new name, you need to specify the full
name, including the .WAV extension.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.1 3.11
