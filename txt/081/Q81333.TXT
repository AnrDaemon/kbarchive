SUMMARY
=======

MousHook.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to install and use a WH_MOUSE
mouse message hook. The mouse message hook in MousHook.exe disables the right
mouse button for all applications in the system by discarding WM_RBUTTONDOWN and
WM_NCRBUTTONDOWN messages. The mouse hook function beeps each time it discards a
message.

MousHook.exe contains the source to an application program, TESTAPP, and a
dynamic-link library (DLL), MousHook.dll, that implements the mouse hook. The
MousHook.dll uses the new hook functions provided by Windows 3.1:
SetWindowsHookEx(), UnhookWindowsHookEx(), and CallNextHookEx().

TESTAPP calls MOUSHOOK to install the mouse hook. When TESTAPP is closed, it
removes the mouse hook from the system.
