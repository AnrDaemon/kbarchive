It is possible to convert sound files created on an Apple Macintosh to
a PC Wave format. To do so, the Macintosh sound file must be converted
to an AIFF (audio interchange file format) file format with a
application called Soundedit. Soundedit supports most of the popular
sound formats found on Macintosh systems.

After successfully loading the file into Soundedit, save the file into
the AIFF format. Next the file will need to be ported to the PC. After
successfully porting the file to the PC, run CONVERT.EXE, a utility
included on the MDK (Multimedia Development Kit), to convert the sound
file from the AIFF format to a Wave format.
