TITLE   :FIX: EVEN, ALIGN Generate Error in AT Segments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 incorrectly generates the
following error when an EVEN or ALIGN statement is used in a segment that has an
"AT" combine type:

   error A2189: invalid combination with segment alignment : X

X is equal to 2 for EVEN directives, and equal to the alignment of the ALIGN
directive. MASM version 5.1 does not generate this error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.
