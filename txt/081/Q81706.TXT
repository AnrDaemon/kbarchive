SUMMARY
=======

When Windows creates an owner-draw combo box, it sends WM_DRAWITEM messages to
the parent window of the combo box. To respond to this message, the parent
window must perform the steps necessary to draw the items in the owner-draw
combo box.

OwnCombo.exe is a sample in the Microsoft Download Center that contains an
example of a fixed-height owner-draw combo box that contains strings. The combo
box also demonstrates painting bitmaps, changing the text color, and storing
data associated with each item using the CB_SETITEMDATA message. All of the
relevant code is contained within the ODDLG.C module.
