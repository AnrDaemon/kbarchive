-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The UNINSTAL.EXE program included with your MS-DOS Upgrade should only be run
under the version of MS-DOS that it shipped with. This is because the program
assumes it will be run under that version, and other versions of MS-DOS may not
be able to properly access the hard drive(s) or behave as UNINSTAL.EXE expects.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Uninstall #1 disk must be created in drive A because it is an MS-DOS boot
disk that automatically executes UNINSTAL.EXE. To uninstall MS-DOS, place the
Uninstall #1 disk in drive A and reboot the computer.

If the Uninstall #1 disk won't boot, do the following:

1. Create an MS-DOS system disk with the SETUP /F command.

2. Rename the CONFIG.SYS file on that disk.

3. Boot with that disk and then run the Uninstall program.

If you cannot run the SETUP /F command and another MS-DOS machine is available
and is running the same version of MS-DOS, you can use the SYS command to create
a system disk on that machine.

If you cannot create an MS-DOS system disk, determine whether the previous MS-DOS
version can access the hard drive properly. If it does, you may be able to
manually install the previous MS-DOS version without losing any data.

If necessary, reformat your disk using the previous MS-DOS version.
