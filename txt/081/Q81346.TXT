When running the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks server as an application,
the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Gateway to Fax does not allow you to

made in the Gateway Accounts screen and must be made at the server. Even when
sitting at the server, you will receive the following error after clicking on
the Cover Page button:

   You are not allowed to assign cover pages from a remote machine

==========

To make changes to the cover page option, bring the server up as an INIT, make
the desired changes, change the server back to an application.

here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
