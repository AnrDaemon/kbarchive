TITLE   :FIX: SQLRowCount Returns -1 After Inserting a BLOB >= 400K
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)

KEYWORDS:kbODBC kbODBC370bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, version 3.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 54818 (SQLBUG_70)


SYMPTOMS
========

After inserting 400K or more of data for a text or image column, a call to the
ODBC SQLRowCount function incorrectly returns -1, if the following conditions
are met:

 - You use the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, version 3.7.

 - The backend is Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 or later.

CAUSE
=====

If the amount of data that needs to be inserted is more than 400K, the ODBC
Driver for SQL Server switches to another mechanism to insert the data.


WORKAROUND
==========

Run the ODBCCMPT utility against your ODBC application. For more information,
refer to Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 Books Online or the following Web address:

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/sql/4_opingc.htm
   (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/sql/4_opingc.htm)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft ODBC Driver for
SQL Server, version 3.7.

This bug was corrected in SQL Server 7.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because Microsoft Access 97 uses the SQLRowCount function to verify a successful
INSERT, the following error message occurs when you try to insert BLOB data that
is 400K or more into an attached SQL Server table:

   ODBC - Insert on a linked table 'table name' failed.

Additional query words: sp_createorphan blob insert ole object
