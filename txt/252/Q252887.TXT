-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Generating a report on file differences truncates the lines of the files.

CAUSE
=====

The display limits the entire line to 80 characters, which truncates lines at 36
characters per file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways to work around this problem:

Command line:

Execute the difference from the command line by using the -D switch and
specifying how many characters wide to make the output.

External program:

Gather the files from SourceSafe on which you want to perform the difference and
use another file difference utility to compare the two files.
