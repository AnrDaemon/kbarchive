======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing any of the layout properties of the ADO DataGrid Control at design time
may cause the grid to not appear properly at run time. Instead of showing the
correct data, the grid will appear with two columns and the correct number of
rows and the cells that appear will be empty.

This also occurs when changing the number of splits at design time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, after editing the DataGrid Control, right click it and
select Clear Fields or Retrieve Fields. This will allow the DataGrid to show the
data in the correct number of columns at run-time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE in Visual Basic.

2. Click References on the Project menu and select ActiveX Data Objects Library
   2.1.

3. Click Components on the Project menu and select Microsoft ADO Data Control
   6.0 (OLEDB) and Microsoft DataGrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB).

4. Place an ADO Data Control (Adodc1) on Form1 and set the following properties:

   ConnectionString: Enter a valid Northwind connection
   CursorLocation: adUseClient
   RecordSource: SELECT * FROM Employees

5. Place a DataGrid (DataGrid1) on the form and set the following properties:

   DataSource: Adodc1

6. Right-click DataGrid1 and select Edit from the pop-up menu that appears. Then
   again right-click DataGrid1 and select Split from the pop-up menu.

7. Run the code. Both splits on the DataGrid will display with two columns and
   nine rows. The cells will be empty.

8. Quit the application and right-click DataGrid at design time. Select Clear
   fields from the pop-up menu. Now the data should display correctly at run
   time.
