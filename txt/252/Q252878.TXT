TITLE   :XCLN: Schedule+ Err Mssg: The File Req32.cfg Could Not Be Opened
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0,7.0a,7.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.0, 7.0a, 7.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a stand-alone version of Schedule+ and Microsoft Outlook is not
running or has not been installed, you may receive the following error message:

   The file <drive>:\<OS>\Forms\Configs\Req32.cfg could not be
   opened.

The Configs folder exists on the computer, but the Req32.cfg file is located in a
different folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Copy the entire contents of the Schedule folder, normally found in the
   <drive>:\MSOffice folder, to the
   <drive>:\<OS>\Forms\Configs folder, where <drive> is the
   hard disk drive that contains the folders, and <OS> is the type of
   operating system that the computer is running.

2. Restart the computer.

3. Restart Schedule+.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Another workaround for the error message in the "Symptoms" section of this
article is available, but to use that workaround you must install Microsoft
Exchange Client and Schedule+ version 7.5 simultaneously from a Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0 CD-ROM. For additional information about that
workaround, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q195205 Outlook/Schedule+ Error req32.cfg could not be opened

The workaround in that article is only accurate if you have installed Schedule+
from the Exchange Server 5.0 CD-ROM; it is not accurate if you installed the
stand-alone version of Schedule+.
