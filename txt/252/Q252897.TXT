TITLE   :TAMA Does Not Run Update Script for Management Agent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Together Administration Management Agent (TAMA) in Microsoft Metadirectory
Services (MMS) 2.1 creates connector space objects and the Export.ta file, and
then optionally runs a TAMA script. However, after you run TAMA, the connector
name space objects and Export.ta file are successfully created but the TAMA
control script may not run. If the TAMA script does not run, the associated
management agent contains the correct connector space objects but the connected
directory is not updated. In addition, the operator's log does not report the
failure to update the connected directory.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the distinguished name (DN) of the management agent
contains spaces.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, do not use spaces in the DN when you create
management agents. For existing management agents, create a replacement
management agent and delete the agent that contains spaces in its name.

NOTE: Renaming management agents is not supported.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Metadirectory Services
2.1.
