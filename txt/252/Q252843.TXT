TITLE   :XCON: MTA Generates a Large Number of Event ID 4293
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail backs up in the queues, and the message transfer agent (MTA) generates a
large number of the following Event ID 4293:

   Event ID: 4293
   Source: MSExchange MTA
   Type: Warning
   Category: Field Engineering

   (POP4 POP4 UP(7) PROC 39) Incoming Connection rejected due to an incorrect
   T-selector. Called T-Selector is: %1%2%3

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if T Selector values are mismatched either on incoming or
outgoing connections. You can find the X.400 transport selectors in the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in the three following
configuration fields:

 - Stack T Selector. To find this configuration field, perform the following
   steps:

   1. Click to expand Site, click to expand Configuration, click to expand
      Servers, and click the Server object.

   2. In the right pane, a protocol stack in the following form is displayed:

   TCP(<server name>)

      The following is a sample protocol stack:

   TCP(Server1)

 - Outgoing T Selector. To find this configuration field, perform the following
   step:

   Click to expand Site, click to expand Configuration, click to expand
   Connectors, and in the right pane, click your X.400 Connector. Click the
   Stack tab; this tab has both an Outgoing and Incoming section for transport
   values.

 - Incoming T Selector. To find this configuration field, perform the following
   step:

   Click to expand Site, click to expand Configuration, click to expand
   Connectors, and in the right pane, click your X.400 Connector. Click the
   Stack tab; this tab has both an Outgoing and Incoming section for transport
   values.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although a T Selector value is optional, if you do use this value you must make
sure that it is an exact match with the corresponding value that is specified
for the transport selector on the target Microsoft Exchange Server computer. If
a remote administrator wants to specify an S Selector or a P Selector, the
remote administrator must only do so after successful messaging has been
established. The T, S, and P Selectors are supported between Exchange Server
computers.
