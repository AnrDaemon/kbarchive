TITLE   :Error Message: (DB5_getRootRecord) Error Locating Local DSA Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Metadirectory server log in Zoomserv\Data\Logs\Genlogs may report
the following error message:

   (DB5_getRootRecord) Error locating local
   dsa:[DsaName=serverName,ou=Applications,contextPrefixRDN]

In addition to the preceding error message, you may experience the following
behavior:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Service (Zoomit Server service) continues to run.

 - You are able to log on to the Compass client.

 - Management Agents do not work correctly.

 - Objects may be missing in the metadirectory.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) record has
been either damaged or deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, you must rebuild the DSA record and reset the value of
the DSA's standard attribute to its default values (as defined in
\Zoomserv\Bin\Init\At.st). To rebuild the DSA record, follow these steps:

1. Start a command prompt.

2. Change folders to the \Zoomserv\Bin\Init folder on the drive where Microsoft
   Metadirectory Services is installed

3. Run the following command:

..\bin\importt -updatedib -updateallattributes
The preceding command can successfully run with the service either running or
stopped. However, if possible, the server should be stopped. None of the
metaverse data can be affected.

NOTE: If the preceding resolution does not correct the problem, contact Microsoft
Product Support Services.
