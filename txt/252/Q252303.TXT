The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

Internet Database Connector (IDC) Scripting can support multiple complex SQL
statements in one script. This provides a convenient way for using IDC to
develop dynamic Web pages. The corresponding .htx file must be modified to allow
multiple SQL query results to be shown from the browser. The sample IDC scripts
shipped with Internet Information Server 3.0 and 4.0 only give samples of one
SQL statement per IDC file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax for a IDC Script (sample) with multiple SQL statements:

   Datasource:mydatasrc_name
   Template: result.htx
   SQLStatement:

   SELECT  field1, field2 from Table1
   +Where field1=%Variable_Name%

   AND

   SELECT fld1, fld2, fld3 from Table2
   +Where fld1="field_data"

   Password:
   Username:

As shown in this sample, you can use "AND" to connect multiple SQL statements.

The user input variable is indicated by "%Variable_Name%".

In the corresponding .htx pages, you must use one
"<%Begindetail%>...<%Enddetail%>" session for each SQL SELECT
statement.
