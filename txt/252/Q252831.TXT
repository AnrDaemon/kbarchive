TITLE   :SMSINST: Iterative Use Of Get Temporary Filename Can Cause Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Systems Management Server (SMS) Installer Script Editor to
assign a temporary file name (Get Temporary Filename into <variablename>),
the generated SMS Installer program can cause an "Access violation" error
message similar to:

   The instruction at <xxx> referenced memory at <yyy>. The memory
   could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Get Temporary Filename script action is used
within a loop. For example, the following sample script generates the error
message:

   Set Variable COUNT to 1
   While COUNT Not Equal 200 do
      Get Temporary Filename into MYFILE
      Set variable COUNT to %COUNT% (Increment)
   End Block

For small loop iterations (less than 130), the problem does not occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use the Get Temporary Filename script action in a loop that is likely to
iterate beyond 130 times.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 2.0.91.
