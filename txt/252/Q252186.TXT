SYMPTOMS
========

When your Windows NT Terminal Server-based computer removes dormant server
connections, it may generate an error message similar to the following error
message in the Rdr.sys file on a blue screen:

   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

last parameter (0xf71e9ec5) will be the same if you are running the x86 version
of Windows NT, Terminal Server Edition with Service Pack 5 installed.

value that is stored in paged pool memory while running at Dispatch Level.
