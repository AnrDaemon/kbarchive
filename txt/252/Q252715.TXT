Do not attempt to change the attribute type for these special-case attributes.
Choose a different attribute to populate as multi-valued or collective.

MORE INFORMATION

   Search, and then type the name of the attribute you want to change. For
   example, try searching for GivenName.

2. When the attribute is found, double-click it to display its properties.

   Multi, or Collective. This value specifies whether an attribute is
