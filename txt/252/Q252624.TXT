TITLE   :XIMS: Internet Mail w. Illegal X-Mac-Creator Attribute Archived
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 3, you cannot send an
Internet mail message that contains an illegal X-Mac-Creator attribute in the
mail header. The Internet mail message is archived and Event ID 12006 and Event
ID 4117 are displayed in the Windows NT Event Viewer. An illegal X-Mac-Creator
attribute is created if you attach Macintosh binary files to some Internet mail
applications for Macintosh.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 2 and earlier ignored the X-Mac-Type
and X-Mac-Creator attributes. Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 3
supports headers that contain these attributes in messages. But if the
attributes in these headers contain illegal data format, Exchange Server version
5.5 Service Pack 3 moves the message to the archive folder instead of delivering
it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
