SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print to an LPR printer, the WritePrinter() application
programming interface (API) may not work when the program you are using calls
the API. The GetLastError() API may return the following error message:

   ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the status of the print job changes between the time the
WritePrinter() API requests the size needed for the status and the time the
WritePrinter() API requests the status from the spooler.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change the printer settings from the "Start print
immediately" option to the "Start printing after the last page is spooled"
option.
