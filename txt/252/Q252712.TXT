SYMPTOMS
========

When you add an attachment to a new e-mail message by using Outlook Web Access
(OWA), the following error message may be displayed:

   The page cannot be displayed

The following event is logged in the application event log on the Microsoft
Internet Information Service (IIS) OWA server:

   Source: MSExchangeWeb
   Description: "End of the data reached while looking for token"

This problem may also occur when you try to open an e-mail attachment by using
Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur because the OWA virtual directory is configured with
Microsoft Windows NT Challenge\Response (NTLM) authentication only.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, configure the OWA virtual directory to use
Anonymous authentication in addition to NTLM authentication.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access
version 5.5.
