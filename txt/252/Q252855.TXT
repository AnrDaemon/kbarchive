======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the 16-bit version of the Microsoft Systems Management Server
Installer on a 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating system (such as Microsoft
Windows 95, Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows NT), various errors occur when
Systems Management Server Installer interprets the 0x5c (\) character in file
names and directories.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Installer interprets the 0x5c character as a slash
(\). Because 16-bit operating systems don't support the 0x5c character, this
behavior does not occur on these operating systems.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the 32-bit version of Systems Management Server Installer on 32-bit Windows
operating systems.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 2.0.
