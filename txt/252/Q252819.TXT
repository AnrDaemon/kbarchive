TITLE   :XFOR: Read Receipt from cc:Mail Loses Content
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a message is sent from an external Internet address to a Lotus cc:Mail
address through Exchange Server, the returned read receipt loses content and the
external sender receives a blank read receipt.

CAUSE
=====

When the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail creates a message for
read receipt, the Connector for cc:Mail does not set the PR_REPORT_TIME
property, so the Internet Mail Service does not generate the message body for
the read receipt when it sends the read receipt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, configure the Internet Mail Service to always use
Rich Text Format (RTF), but be aware that this may destroy the format of some
messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Another issue that is a result of the same issue is that all read receipts from
cc:Mail to Exchange Server users lose the last line of the read receipt lost,
for example:

   was read on 12/21/1999 5:19 PM
