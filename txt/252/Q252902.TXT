   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) or later on an
Alpha computer that is running Exchange Server 5.5, you may experience a Dr.
Watson crash in the information store.

CAUSE
=====

Starting in Windows NT 4.0 SP4, there are changes in the heap manager that may
prevent the information store from allocating memory that it had previously
freed.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File
   Execution Options

2. Click the Image File Execution Options key, and then click Add Key from the
   Edit menu to create a new key with the name "store.exe" (without the
   quotation marks). You can leave the Class field blank. This Key Name entry
   should not include a path, only the name of the executable itself.

3. Click the new key you created in step 2, and then click Add Value from the
   Edit menu to create the Value Name: DisableHeapLookaside and Data Type:
   REG_SZ.

4. Click OK, and then type "1" (without the quotation marks) in the String
   field.

   Summary for the above entries:

   Key Name: store.exe
   Class:

   Value Name: DisableHeapLookaside
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: 1

5. You do not usually need to restart the system to see the results. You can
   usually simply restart the Exchange Server information store because this
   registry value is inspected during each process initialization. However, you
   may need to restart the computer to properly restart the information store.
