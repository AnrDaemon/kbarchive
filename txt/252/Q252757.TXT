PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Visual Basic code that uses Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) and that
logs on to a mailbox, gets a folder object, and then sets the object to nothing
in a loop causes a memory leak.

CAUSE
=====

The reference count for an internal object never reaches zero and it is
reallocated, which causes the memory leak.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.5. This
problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code may cause the memory leak:

   Dim CdoExpStore As InfoStore
   Dim i As Integer
   Dim Cdoexpfolder As MAPI.Folder

       For i = 1 To 10000
           Set Cdoexpfolder = CdoExpStore.RootFolder
           Set Cdoexpfolder = Nothing
       Next i
