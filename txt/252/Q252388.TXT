   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

NOTE: This article describes how to edit the default user Ntuser.dat file on a
Windows NT workstation. You can use the same steps to edit existing profiles or
to create an Ntuser.dat file for distribution with mandatory or roaming
profiles. However, the security and administration issues raised by these other
uses of this information are beyond the scope of this article. Use the
information in this article at your own risk.


When you are installing a printer for users on a Windows NT workstation, you may
want that printer to be used as the default printer for all users of the
workstation without adding all of those users to groups that have the right to
add printers. New users can use an installed printer if the Default User profile
has been correctly edited to add the correct information for that printer.

The Default User profile is created when Windows NT is installed. The first time
a user logs on to a workstation (or domain), the default user profile is copied
to the user profile. Therefore, only new users are affected by changing the
Default User profile as described in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To add a default printer for all new users:

1. Log on with the Administrator account and install the appropriate default
   printer.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. Locate the following key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Devices

Note the information for the value of the key that represents the default printer
that you created in step 1. For example, "Generic / Text Only : REG_SZ :
winspool,LPT1:" is the printer named "Generic / Text Only" that is installed as
a local printer using printer port LPT1. Network printers are listed as
\\<servername>\<sharename> with a REG_SZ value similar to
"winspool,Ne00:".

4. On the Window menu, click HKEY_USERS.

5. On the Registry menu, click Load Hive.

6. In the %SystemRoot%\Profiles\Default User folder, click the Ntuser.dat file,
   and then click Open.

7. In the Key Name box, type "ntuser" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

8. Open the following key:

   NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Devices

9. On the Edit menu, click Add Value. Create the same value you noted earlier.
   For example, if you are using the sample printer mentioned earlier, "Generic
   / Text Only" is the value name, "REG_SZ" is the data type, and
   "winspool,LPT1:" is the string.

10. Locate the following key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\PrinterPorts

11. Note the information for the value of the key that represents the default
   printer that you created in step 1. For example, "Generic / Text Only :
   REG_SZ : winspool,LPT1:,15,45".

12. Locate the following key:

   HKEY_USERS\NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\PrinterPorts

13. On the Edit menu, click Add Value. Create the same value you noted in the
   previous step. For example, if you are using the sample printer mentioned
   earlier, "Generic / Text Only" is the value name, "REG_SZ" is the data type,
   and "winspool,LPT1:,15,45" is the string.

14. Locate the following key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Windows

15. Note the information for the Device value. For example, "Generic / Text
   Only,winspool,LPT1:".

16. Double-click the Device value in the following key:

   HKEY_USERS\NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Windows

17. Edit the Device value to reflect the information you noted in the previous
   step. For the sample printer, use "Generic / Text Only,winspool,LPT1:" for
   the string.

18. Locate the following key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Printers

19. Make a note of all the values contained in this key and any subkeys. You may
   want to use the Save Key command on the Registry menu.

20. Select the following key:

   HKEY_USERS\NTUSER

21. On the Edit menu, click Add Key. Type "Printers" (without the quotation
   marks) for the new key name.

22. Click the following key:

   HKEY_USERS\NTUSER\Printers

23. Add all the values that you noted in the step 19. You may want to restore
   the key that you previously saved. To do this, click the key, and then click
   Restore Key on the Registry menu.

24. In the HKEY_USERS window, click the NTUSER key.

25. On the Registry menu, click Unload Hive.

26. Quit Registry Editor.

After you follow these steps, the Ntuser.dat file contains the same installed
printers and default printer as the Administrator account. New users who log on
to the computer do not need the right to add a printer to use the device. For
