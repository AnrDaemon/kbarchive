SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create and start a service remotely on a Windows
NT-based or Windows 2000-based computer from the command line.

In this scenario, the program file resides on all the remote computers; you want
to write a script to create and start the service automatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Netsvc.exe and Instsrv.exe tools from the Resource Kit do not create a
service on a remote computer. The Srvinstw.exe tool from the Resource Kit is a
program that you use to create remote services, but it is not a command-line
tool that you can use in a script.

To create a script to create and start a service on a remote computer, use the
Sc.exe tool from the Resource Kit. The syntax for this utility is:

   sc \\<computername> create notepad binpath=
   c:\winnt\system32\notepad.exe type= own start= auto depend= "+TDI Netbios"

This particular command instructs the remote computer to create the "Notepad"
service, then tells the computer where it can find the program file for this
service.

The start=auto option instructs the computer to start the new Notepad service
automatically when the computer is booted. The depend="+TDI Netbios" option
tells the computer that it is dependent on the TDI group and on the NetBIOS
service. Note that you must add quotation marks around the list of
space-separated dependencies.

For more detailed information about the Sc.exe tool, please see the Sc-dev.txt
file located in the Resource Kit.
