======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt a remote installation of the Systems Management Server (SMS)
2.0 client software on Microsoft Windows clients that are also running Windows
NT Novell NetWare Directory Services (NDS), the installation may not be
successfully completed.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 clients are configured as NDS clients only. Neither the SMS
Client Remote Installation account nor the SMS Service account has
administrative rights on the Windows NT workstation.

To install the client software on a Windows NT computer whose logged-on user does
not have local administrative rights, either the SMS Service account or the SMS
Client Remote Installation account will be used. Either account can be used in
Windows NT and NetWare environments. At least one of these accounts must have
local administrative rights on the computers on which the SMS client software
will be installed or the installation will not succeed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following procedures:

 - Make all Windows NT clients in NetWare environments members of the Windows NT
   domain in which the SMS Service account exists. Even though such clients may
   not log on to that domain, those clients need to have machine accounts so
   that the SMS Client Remote Installation account or SMS Service account can be
   used.

-or-

 - Create a local administrative account on each Windows NT computer with the
   same user name and password as the SMS Service account or the SMS Client
   Remote Installation account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During site setup, the SMS Service account is made a member of the domain
Administrators group for the site server's domain and, therefore, it has
administrative rights on all Windows NT computers in that domain. The SMS Client
Remote Installation account does not need to be a member of the domain
Administrators group, but it does need local administrative rights on the
computers on which the SMS client software will be installed.
