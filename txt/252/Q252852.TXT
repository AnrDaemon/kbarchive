TITLE   :SMS: Admin Console Doesn't Display Local SMS Version Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbMMC kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsAdmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you check for the version of the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator Console that is currently installed on a remote administrative
computer, the Administrator Console reveals only the version of SMS installed on
the site server. This does not help you determine if a computer needs to update
the installed version of the SMS Administrator Console.

WORKAROUND
==========

To check the remote SMS Administrator Console version on a local computer,
follow these steps:

1. Use Regedtd32.exe to open the computer's registry.

2. Navigate to the following folder:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Setup\UI Version

NOTE: If the version in this registry key is different from the version build
number of the site, the SMS Administrator Console software should be updated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
