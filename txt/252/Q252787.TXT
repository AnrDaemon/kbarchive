======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Visual FoxPro Command window, enter the command:

   HELP DO FORM

or go to page 529 in Microsoft Visual FoxPro 6.0 Language Reference.

Locate the section labeled "WITH cParameterList."

The documentation currently states:

   "If a form set is run, the parameters are passed to the form set's Init
   method if the form set's WindowType property is set to ModeLess (0) or Modal
   (1). The parameters are passed to the Setup1 method if the form set's
   WindowType property is set to Read (2) or ReadModal (3)."

The documentation should state:

   If a form set is run, the parameters are passed to the form set's Init method
   if the form set's WindowType property is set to ModeLess (0) or Modal (1).
   The parameters are passed to the Load method if the form set's WindowType
   property is set to Read (2) or ReadModal (3).

In the second sentence, note that the parameters are passed to the LOAD method
not the Setup1 method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WindowType property settings of Read (2) or ReadModal (3) are included for
backward compatibility and available only for forms converted from previous
versions of FoxPro.
