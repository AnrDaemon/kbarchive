======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Exchange Server Connectivity Controller, you may
receive the following messages:

   MSExchangeCOCO
   EventID: 2002
   Error {WIN32:5 (Access is denied.)}: Could not create connection 1 for
   \\.\pipe\lsi\control.

   MSExchangeCOCO
   EventID: 2013
   Error {I/O error has occurred}: System resources used by the Remote Connection
   Server
   \\.\pipe\lsi\control could not be created.

   MSExchangeCOCO
   EventID: 10200
   Error {I/O error has occurred}: Unable to create RCServer object.

   MSExchangeCOCO
   EventID: 10001
   Error {I/O error has occurred}: Could not initialize Controller.

   MSExchangeCOCO
   EventID: 511
   Error {I/O error has occurred}: The application failed while processing.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the account that is used by the Connectivity
Controller does not have the rights necessary to start the service.

When you install the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, the Microsoft
Exchange Connector for SNADS, the Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM
OfficeVision/VM (PROFS), or the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell
GroupWise, you are prompted to enter the account that is used as the service
account for the connector. (During setup, you receive a message stating that the
account must be a member of the Administrators group.)

If the account being used is not a member of the Administrators group, the
Connectivity Controller will not start.

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, either add the account to the Administrators group or
grant the account used by the Connectivity Controller the rights to start the
service.

The list of accounts that have the rights to start the Connectivity Controller is
kept in the directory Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Exchconn.ini in the controller
section:

   rcsaccess = Administrators

To grant an account the rights to start the Connectivity Controller, add it in
the Exchconn.ini:

   rcsaccess = Administrators, mydomain\myaccount

You can now start the Connectivity Controller service with your account even if
your account is not part of the Administrators group.
