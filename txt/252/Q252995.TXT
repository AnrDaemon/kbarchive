SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) is a server application that is capable
of running on computers that are running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5
and later and Microsoft Windows 2000. This article describes performance
recommendations for MMS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For best performance Microsoft recommends that you run MMS on a member server
not a domain controller. Microsoft also recommends that you do not run MMS on a
server that contains other programs that require most of the system resources.

Additionally, Microsoft recommends you configure the following server
optimization on Windows platforms:

 - In Windows NT 4.0, Maximum throughput for network applications.

 - In Windows 2000, Maximum data throughput for network applications.

To change your current settings to the recommended settings, use the appropriate
steps:

1. Log on as an Administrator.

2. Right-click Network Neighborhood, and then click Properties.

4. Click "Maximize throughput for Network Applications", and then restart the
   computer.
