The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

In Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, "Windows NT Challenge/Response" (also
known as NTLM) was listed as an authentication method on the Directory Security
tab of a Web site. In IIS 5.0, however, this authentication method is not
listed.

CAUSE
=====

In IIS 5.0, NTLM is referred to instead as "Integrated Windows authentication".

RESOLUTION

Use "Integrated Windows authentication" as you would have used NTLM in IIS 4.0.
