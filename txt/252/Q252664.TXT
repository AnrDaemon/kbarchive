TITLE   :Stop 0x0000000A Error in Tcpip.sys on FTP Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your Windows NT-based computer is running the File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
service, you may receive a "Stop 0x0000000A" error message in the Tcpip.sys file
on a blue screen.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur on a multiple processor FTP server because of an error
adjusting the size of the Ipr_Buffer chain. The buffer size was not trimmed
correctly when urgent packets were resequenced where an overlap existed.
Overlaps can occur when packets are received from computers using non-Windows
implementations of the TCP/IP stack.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
