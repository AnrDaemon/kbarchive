PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft NT client has multiple static IP addresses bound to a single
Network Interface Card (NIC), Systems Management Server (SMS) only recognizes
the last IP address in the list against the boundaries of the site.

During a SMS client installation, it is not installed because the client being is
not assigned to the site.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

 - Upgrade to SMS Service Pack 2.

 - Change the order of the IP address so that the last one is within the SMS
   site boundary.

 - If the IP address within SMS site boundary has to be the first one in the
   order, then add another IP address to the end of the list which is also
   within the site boundary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SMS 2.0 version SP1. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for SMS 2.0 version
SP1. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
