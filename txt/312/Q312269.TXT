TITLE   :XADM: Duplicate Calendar Entries w Update Method & Outlook 2002
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After Microsoft Outlook 2002 receives a meeting request in the Inbox, Outlook
2002 may create a duplicate calendar appointment. If a Collaboration Data
Objects (CDO) application calls GetAssociatedAppointment and places a meeting in
your calendar first, and then you click the meeting request in Outlook 2002 to
open it, a duplicate appointment is created. Outlook 2000 does not create
duplicate appointments in this scenario.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if CDO was not updated to reflect the way that Outlook
2002 uses index PR_OWNER_APPT_ID to determine duplicate appointments.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems

recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack
that contains this fix.
