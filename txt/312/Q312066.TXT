TITLE   :Computer Does Not Boot Without a Video Adapter with the SAK
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Server Appliance Kit (SAK), version 2.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Server Appliance Kit (SAK) version 2.0 to configure a target
computer to be "headless" (to be operated without a video adapter), the computer
may not be able to boot.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because SAK 2.0 includes the Ntldr file from Microsoft
Windows 2000, which does not support booting without a video adapter.
