DOCUMENT:Q312883  15-JAN-2002  [iis]
TITLE   :You Cannot Change the "Cache ISAPI Applications" Property
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are trying to either select or to remove the check in the Cache ISAPI
Applications check box on an Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 application
folder, the check box is not available (it is dimmed) and you cannot change the
value. You can change the value on the Web site level but not on application
level.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the ADSutil.vbs administration script to change
the application property:

 - To not cache ISAPI applications on the folder called "myapplication":

   C:\Inetpub\AdminScripts>cscript.exe adsutil.vbs set w3svc/1/root/myapplication/cacheisapi 0

 - To allow the cache of ISAPI applications on the folder called
   "myapplication":

   C:\Inetpub\AdminScripts>cscript.exe adsutil.vbs set w3svc/1/root/myapplication/cacheisapi 1

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.
