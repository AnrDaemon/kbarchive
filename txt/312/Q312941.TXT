TITLE   :PRB: IIS May Hang If You Enable ASP Server-Side Script Debugging
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you enable Active Server Pages (ASP) server-side script debugging in the Web
site configuration and ASP encounters a scripting error, Internet Information
Services (IIS) may hang, but no error messages are sent to the client browser.

NOTE: This behavior may occur if you have installed the Microsoft Script Debugger
or Microsoft Visual Interdev on a server that is running Microsoft IIS 4.0 or
5.0 in a development environment.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because you have not properly configured the default
debugger that is in use.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, make the additional configurations that are outlined
in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q281427 PRB: Microsoft Script Debugger Does Not Break at Error

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You should not enable the Enable Server-Side Script Debugging property on a
production environment.

The enabling of server-side script debugging causes ASP to run in a single
threaded mode; therefore, one thread at a time only executes for each
application. Even if you properly configure the Microsoft Script Debugger, this
dramatically affects the Web server performance.
