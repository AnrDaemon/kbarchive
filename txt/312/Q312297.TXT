TITLE   :Cannot Update Cached Forms if You Are Not an Administrator
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbprint kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT-based clients can cache printer forms in the registry. After a form
is cached, an administrator can update forms on the server side, and these
changes are sent to the client-side cached forms. If a user has administrator
permissions for the local computer, cached forms refresh correctly. However, if
you are logged on to the local computer as a user that does not have
administrator permissions, you may not be able to refresh your cached printer
forms.
