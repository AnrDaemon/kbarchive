TITLE   :CiCatalogFlags Cannot Disable Local NTFS Notifications
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you disable notification processing for local paths by setting CiCatalogFlags
REG_DWORD to 0x00000002 or 0x00000003, Index Server may ignore this setting for
local NTFS paths. Disabling notifications for FAT drives and UNC paths works as
expected.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to query a catalog, but prevent Index Server from indexing any
changes or new files, set the catalog to read-only by pausing it. You do this by
performing one of the following:

 - In the Index server Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, pause the
   catalog (Microsoft Windows 2000 only).

-or-

 - Use the catalog administration API CatAdm.PauseCatalog(). For more
   information on how to use the catalog administration API, refer the MSDN
   Library.

-or-

 - Issue the following command from Cmd.exe to set all catalogs to read-only:

   "net pause cisvc" (without the quotation marks)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
