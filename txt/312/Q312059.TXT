SYMPTOMS
========

When you type a word in FactFinder, and then click the green arrow, you may
receive the following error message:

   FF has caused an invalid page fault in module Ole32.dll

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you have a version of CompuServe that uses Virtual Key.
The Virtual Key program uses the Rpawinet.dll file, which conflicts with
FactFinder.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you no longer use CompuServe, rename the Rpawinet.dll file to resolve this
issue.

If you still use CompuServe, download the latest release of CompuServe, and then
rename the file then to resolve this issue.

Download CompuServe Update
--------------------------
