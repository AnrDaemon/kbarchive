TITLE   :UuidCreateSequential() Is Not Exported in Rpcrt4.dll from SP6a
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400nospFixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Programs that rely on the UuidCreateSequential Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
function may not work, and you may receive an error message that is similar to:

   <Programname.exe> - Entry Point Not Found

   The procedure entry point UuidCreateSequential could not be located in the
   dynamic link library Rpct4.lib.

CAUSE
=====

The Rpcrt4.dll (version 4.0.1381.7097) component that is included with Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a) contains modified UuidCreate functionality to
match that of Microsoft Windows 2000, but does not export UuidCreateSequential.

The UuidCreate function was modified for security reasons so that it no longer
uses the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the installed Ethernet adapter to
generate Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs). UuidCreateSequential was
introduced to allow the creation of UUIDs by using the MAC address of the
installed Ethernet adapter.
