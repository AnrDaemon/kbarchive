SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to change the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) port number for the Exchange directory service when you
upgrade primary domain controllers (PDCs) or backup domain controllers (BDCs)
that run Exchange Server 5.5.

Change the LDAP Port for Exchange Server
----------------------------------------

1. In the Microsoft Exchange program group, start Microsoft Exchange
   Administrator.

2. Connect to the server. If necessary, click "Connect to Server" on the File
   menu to display the "Connect to Server" dialog box, type the server name, and
   then click OK.

3. Expand Site, expand Configuration, and then click Protocols.

4. Double-click LDAP (Directory) Site Defaults. On the General tab, change the
   port number to 390, and then click OK to configure the Exchange directory
   service to use TCP port 390.

5. Close Microsoft Exchange Administrator, and then restart the computer.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Both the legacy Exchange directory service and Active Directory support LDAP. On
an Active Directory domain controller, Active Directory starts automatically and
locks TCP port 389 for its own use. When Exchange Server starts, Exchange Server
cannot use the same port and cannot communicate by using LDAP until you change
the LDAP port for the Exchange directory service to a port other than 389.

Note that Microsoft recommends that you change the LDAP port for the Exchange
directory service before you upgrade to Windows 2000 and Active Directory.
