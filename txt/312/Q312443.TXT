======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer that runs Exchange Server 5.5, the Internet Mail Service may stop,
and the following information may be recorded in the Application log:

   3013 - The outbound message queue is corrupt. Both inbound and outbound
   queues will be destroyed and rebuilt. This may cause some duplicate outbound
   deliveries.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, rename the Queue.dat file in the Exchsrvr\Imcdata folder
to Queue.old, delete the Queue.dat file, and then manually restart the Internet
Mail Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Internet Mail Service finishes delivering outbound messages before it
stops but has not deleted the messages from the Exchsrvr\Imcdata\Out folder, the
messages will be delivered a second time after the Internet Mail Service
restarts.
