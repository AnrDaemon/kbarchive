TITLE   :BUG: Deadlock in Multithreaded Process Using Declare Statements
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a multithreaded process hosts in-process Visual Basic ActiveX components
(.dll or .ocx files), the multithreaded process may experience a deadlock or may
stop responding (hang).

Examples of multithreaded processes include:

 - Microsoft COM+ (Dllhost.exe)
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server (Inetinfo.exe)
 - Microsoft Transaction Server (Mtx.exe)

CAUSE
=====

There are many causes for a deadlock in a multithreaded process. One possible
cause is the use of Visual Basic 6.0 ActiveX components with Declare statements
for application programming interfaces (APIs).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove the Declare statements in the ActiveX .dll
or .ocx projects, and use a type library to declare those APIs instead. For
additional information about how to create and use a type library, click the
