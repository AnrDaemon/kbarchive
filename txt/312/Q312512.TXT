After a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client is discovered with Network
Discovery and installed by using a Microsoft Windows NT Remote Client
installation, any later discovery by using Network Discovery creates the
following error in the Netdisc.log on the site server:

   ADM: NtBrowser: Failed to create an anonymous connection to device
   <sms-client> , error <0x4c3>.

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS now uses the existing connection if the anonymous connection does not work,
which is typically either the SMS Service Account or the SMS Client Remote
Installation account. The connection is made during a remote client
installation.

Also, if anonymous connections are turned off on the target computer, SMS uses
the SMS service account to connect during Network Discovery. For additional

   Off
