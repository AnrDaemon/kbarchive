TITLE   :Older Versions of Profgen.exe and Newprof.exe Fail on Win2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Profgen.exe version 1.5, along with a copy of Newprof.exe that has
a datestamp from 1997, to automatically create profiles for users who log on to
Microsoft Windows 2000 desktops, either the programs may not create the
profiles, or the profiles that the programs create may be assigned to the wrong
users.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use older versions of the Profgen.exe and
Newprof.exe programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, obtain the newest versions of the Profgen.exe and
Newprof.exe programs. The Microsoft Exchange Server Resource Kit contains
Profgen.exe, and the Microsoft Outlook client installation CD-ROM contains
Newprof.exe.
