SUMMARY
=======

The POSIX utilities, which are included with Supplement One of the Windows 2000
Server Resource Kit, do not work if any folder name in the source path of the
POSIX utilities contains a space.

For example, if the POSIX utility ls.exe is placed in the folder C:\Program
Files, when running ls.exe at the command prompt from that folder you will
receive the following error message:

C:\Program Files\ls
Usage: posix /c <path> [<args>]

To work around this issue, you must place the POSIX utilities in a source path
that does not contain folders with spaces in their names.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The POSIX utilities included with the Resource Kit are not the official Unix
tools provided by Microsoft. If you need to run full-featured UNIX tools in
Windows, please obtain the Microsoft Windows Services For Unix:

listed at the beginning of this article.
