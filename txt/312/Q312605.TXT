TITLE   :Flight Simulator 2002: You Cannot Find the Navigation Charts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are playing Flight Simulator 2002, and you want to view the Navigation
Charts while in flight, there is no way to view the charts.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the charts cannot be viewed from within Flight
Simulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Print the Chart
-------------------------

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. Browse to: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Charts.

3. Double-click the chart that you want to print.

4. On the File menu, click Print.

Method 2: View the Chart in a Seperate Window
---------------------------------------------

1. With Flight Simulator running, start Windows Explorer and browse to
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Charts.

2. Double-click the chart that you want to view.

3. Tile the windows so that you can view the chart and Flight Simulator at the
   same time.

Method 3: Manually Extract Charts 
---------------------------------

The Compact installation does not install Charts. You have to extract them
manually. To do this:

NOTE: These steps assume that you have WinZip installed on your computer. To
obtain WinZip, browse to the following WinZip Computing Inc. Web site:

   http://www.winzip.com

1. Insert the Flight Simulator into the CD-ROM disk 1. Press and hold down SHIFT
   as you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the program from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK:

   "<cd-rom>:\Charts.cab" (without the quotation marks)

   where <cd-rom> is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.

4. This opens the cab file in either Windows Compressed Folder or a program like
   WinZip.

5. Extract the charts (JPEG Files) to C:\Program Files\Microsoft
   Games\FS2002\Charts or another folder.
