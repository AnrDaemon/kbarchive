======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you view a Virtual Tour in Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Macintosh on a 68K
series Macintosh computer, the flashlight pointer that indicates the direction
in which you are looking is not displayed. If you view a Virtual Tour on a Power
Macintosh computer, the flashlight pointer is displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.

Because this feature requires a large number of processor (CPU) cycles, it is not
enabled for 68K series Macintosh computers, which are based on slower
processors.

Additional query words: multi multi-media media mm macmm
