======================================================================

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you record a macro to insert an AutoText entry containing a frame,
Microsoft Word does not insert the frame when you run the macro.

For example, the following recorded macro does not insert the frame contained in
the specified AutoText entry:

   Sub InsertMyAutoText()

       Application.DisplayAutoCompleteTips = True
       NormalTemplate.AutoTextEntries("AutoTextName").Insert _
          Where:=Selection.Range

   End Sub

NOTE: "AutoTextName" is the name of your AutoText entry.

CAUSE
=====

The RichText property is not recorded automatically when you record the macro.
You must manually add the RichText property to your macro code and set it to
True.

For more information about the RichText property, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "richtext" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view "RichText Property."

To correct this problem, add the RichText property to your recorded macro. Your
macro code should look similar to the following example:

   Sub InsertMyAutoText()

      Application.DisplayAutoCompleteTips = True
      Normaltemplate.Autotextentries("AutoTextName").Insert _
         Where:=Selection.Range, RichText:=True

   End Sub
