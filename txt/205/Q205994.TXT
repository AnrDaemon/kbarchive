======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under the following conditions, when you renew your Windows 95-based computer
Internet Protocol (IP) address from a Microsoft Windows NT-based DHCP server,
you may be temporarily logged off of your Novell logon server:

 - Your computer meets one the following conditions:

    - You are running Windows 95 with the Novell NetWare Client32 version 2.5
      software installed.

    - You are running Windows 95 Service Pack 1 with Novell NetWare Client
      version 3.1 software installed.

 - You disconnected from the NetWare server before renewing the IP address.

 - You disconnected from the NetWare server after logging on to the NetWare
   server.

   NOTE: This issue does not occur if you skip the NetWare login process by
   pressing Cancel, you must first log on.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs after the DHCP information exchange between the DHCP client
and DHCP server has completed. When this happens, the client sends an NCB logoff
request, which is then received by the Novell server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Issue
----------------------------

1. Log on to Windows by using the Novell login dialog box.

2. Right-click Network Neighborhood, and then click NetWare Connections.

3. On the Resource column, click the NetWare server you logged on to in step 1.

4. Click Detach, and then click OK. Note that the server name should disappear
   and all drives mapped to that server should be disconnected.

5. Run the Winipcfg.exe tool, click Release to release the current DHCP-assigned
   IP address, and then click Renew. After a few seconds, the Novell welcome
   screen appears and the connection to the NetWare server will be
   re-established.
