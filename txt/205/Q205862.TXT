The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server 5.5 includes additional connectors that connect Exchange Server
to Lotus Notes, SNADS, and IBM OfficeVision/VM (PROFS or OfficeVision). These
connectors are based on the Microsoft Exchange Server Development Kit
specifications for gateways that are comprised of connector and e-mail address
generating components. You only need to install the connectors on Exchange
Server systems that connect to foreign e-mail systems. Install the connectors on
at least one server in the organization.

You need to install the e-mail address generators for the connectors on at least
one server in every site. The address generators interchange e-mail with the
foreign systems that are accessible through the connectors that are installed
throughout the organization. This article provides instructions to install only
the address generator for the connectors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install only the e-mail addressing components for Lotus Notes, SNADS, and IBM
OfficeVision/VM:

1. On the Exchange Server 5.5 installation CD-ROM, open the
   Server\Exchconn\Setup folder.

2. From this folder, start the Setup.exe program. The Welcome dialog box is
   displayed. Click Next. The Select Installation Option dialog box is
   displayed.

3. Click Microsoft Exchange Connectivity Service, and then click Next. The
   Software Selection dialog box is displayed, in which you can select the
   address components that you want to install.

4. Click to select the check boxes for any combination of the Lotus Notes,
   SNADS, and IBM OfficeVision/VM addressing components to install the
   components.

   NOTE: If you do not want to install connectors, do not click to select the
   check boxes for the connectors.

At this point, the wizard installs the components that you selected in the
preceding steps. Additional configuration information is requested for each
component. The Lotus Notes addressing component requires the Lotus Notes domain
name to use as the Exchange Server organization or site. The SNADS component
requires the Distribution Group Name (DGN) ID to use as the Exchange Server
organization. The IBM OfficeVision/VM component requires the Node ID to use as
the organization.

To verify that the addressing component is installed, open the Exchange Server
Administrator program and select a server in the site. Open the Site Address
properties and make sure that the components that you selected in the preceding
steps are listed. You can open the Site Address properties by clicking the
Configuration object for the site, and then double-clicking the Site Addressing
object that is displayed in the right pane.

NOTE: You can also install these components by using the latest Web releases or
service pack releases of the connectors and the Microsoft Exchange Connector for
Novell GroupWise. The steps to install an addressing component by using the
latest Web releases or service pack releases are similar, but there may be
slight differences. Refer to the documentation that is included in the Web
release or service pack release for additional information.
