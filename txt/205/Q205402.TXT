TITLE   :FIX: ClassView Doesn't Show Derived Classes in Embedded Namespac
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClassView kbide kbVC500bug kbVC600fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ClassView pane doesn't display a class that is in an embedded namespace if
it inherits from another class that is defined in the outer namespace.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a typedef statement to create an alias for the class name in the outer
namespace, and then derive from it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Add the following code to a C++ source or header file:

   namespace A
   {
      class ClassA
      {
      public:
         ClassA() {}
      };

      // Create an alias for the outer class.
      typedef A::ClassA A_ClassA;

      namespace B
      {
         // This class is not displayed in ClassView.
         class ClassB1 : public A::ClassA
         {
         public:
            ClassB1() {}
         };

         // This class is displayed in ClassView.
         class ClassB2 : public A_ClassA
         {
         public:
            ClassB2() {}
         };
      } // namespace B
   } // namespace A
