-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the SMTPGATE.EXE program, the following error occurs:

   ERROR SMTPPUT: 201- X - X - Failure submitting message to mail database

   [tx] 552 Error in local delivery

CAUSE
=====

The FILES= setting in your CONFIG.SYS file is set too low. The SMTPGATE.EXE
program requires a large number of file handles; therefore, if the FILES=
statement is set too low, the program cannot run properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit your CONFIG.SYS file and increase the FILES= statement; initially set
FILES= to 40, and then increase the number as needed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In MS-DOS, the default value for the FILES= statement is 8. The highest possible
value is 255.
