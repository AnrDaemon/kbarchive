TITLE   :Windows 95 /L1 Switch in USERTSR /L1 and WUSER /L1 Do Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the USERTSR /L1 and the WUSER /L1 switches on a Windows 95 client,
it does not allow a client to make a remote control connection through the non
default protocol.

However, when you use the default protocol even with the USERTSR /L0 and WUSER
/L0 switches, it works fine. Anything other than /L0 is ineffective.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
