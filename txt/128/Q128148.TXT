TITLE   :PRB: Procedure Entry Point FDIV Not Located in MSVCRT20.DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbtshoot kbusage kbCRT kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a Visual C++ version 2.1 application on Windows NT, you may
receive this error:

   The procedure entry point 'symbol' could not be located in the dynamic
   library MSVCRT20.DLL.

where 'symbol' could be one or all of these:

   _adjust_fdiv
   _adj_fdiv_r
   _adj_fdiv_m64
   _adj_fdivr_m64


CAUSE
=====

The MSVCRT20.DLL file shipped with Visual C++ version 2.1 includes a fix for
Pentium floating point functions. The faulty Pentium FDIV operations are
implemented as internal functions in MSVCRT20.DLL. The error listed above is
caused by linking to an older version of MSVCRT20.DLL - one that does not
contain these functions.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MSVCRT20.DLL library located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 directory under Windows
NT, should be version 2.10 or greater. You can check the version by using the
File Manager. Select (highlight) the MSVCRT20.DLL file, and press ALT-ENTER to
get its properties. If it isn't version 2.10, copy the newer version from the
Visual C++ version 2.1 CD.


A patch has been made available for those who do not have the Visual C++ version
2.1 product CD. For additional information, please see the following article in
