TITLE   :PC Win: GP Fault with Corrupt .XTN Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.0 of Mail for Windows will general protection (GP) fault when you
check for new mail or view new messages.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by irregular .XTN file sizes. If you check the .XTN files to
see if they are divide into 698 evenly, you can tell if that is the problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is fixed by version 3.06 of IMPORT.EXE and MSSFS.DLL with a date of
5/9/93 or later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All .XTN files should be divisible by 698 into even number. Older versions of
IMPORT.EXE will add extra bytes to end of file. You can use the RCX command in
debug to remove the extra few bytes and make it a number that divides into 698
evenly. Here are the steps to debug the file:

1. Identify the problem .XTN. The size of a valid .XTN file should be a multiple
   of 698 bytes.

2. TYPE NETWORK.GLB in the GLB subdirectory. To the left of the 8 digit .XTN
   file number you will see the Network Name for this file.

   NOTE: At this point you could ignore the rest of the steps and use ADMIN.EXE
   to delete and redefine the network that the problem .XTN belongs to. This
   means you will also have to redefine all of the external Postoffices defined
   on that network.

3. Using Admin, count the number of external postoffices defined for this
   network name. This will give us a rough approximation of what the file size
   should be. #Postoffices * 698 approximately equals the size of the .XTN
   file.

   NOTE: The actual size of the file may be larger by a multiple of 698 since
   there may be deleted records in the .XTN file. The only accurate way to
   determine the contents of the XTN is to edit the .XTN file with debug and
   reset the file size to include all records up to and including the last
   record that is not marked as deleted.

4. Using Debug, reset the file size of the problem .XTN file. The cases that
   have been seen thus far where additional information has been appended to the
   file were calculated by the following formula to get the actual .XTN file
   size:

   (Current Size div by 698)
   example: (3015 div 698)
   = 4.3194842 (Where it should divide out to 4)
   Take 4 x 698=2792
   This number has to be converted to HEX
