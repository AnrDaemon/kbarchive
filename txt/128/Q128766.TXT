TITLE   :ADT2: Installing ADT Application on Workstation Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a custom application created with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit (ADT) on a workstation, you may receive the following error
message:

   An error has occurred at changing workgroup database.

CAUSE
=====

Another user is using the system database (SYSTEM.MDA) for the custom
application.

Each time the custom application is set up on a workstation, the Setup program
tries to create the shared system database on the network server.

If one user is running the application and a second user tries to install it,
Setup cannot recreate the SYSTEM.MDA file, and the second user receives the
error message.

STATUS
======

This behavior no longer occurs in Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can prevent Setup from creating the SYSTEM.MDA file after the first
workstation installation is completed by modifying the SETUP.STF file on the
network server as follows:


1. Make a backup copy of the SETUP.STF file located in the shared directory of
   the administrator's installation on the network server, and name the backup
   copy SETUPSTF.BAK.

2. Open the SETUP.STF file on the network server using an application (such as
   Microsoft Excel) that supports a delimited-text file format.

3. In first column of the SETUP.STF file, scroll down to the row that contains
   ObjID. Note that the ObjID row contains column headings. Three of these
   column headings (ObjID [column 1], Title [column 3], and Object Data [column
   6]) are referenced in steps 4 through 10.

4. In the ObjID row, go to the Title column (column 3).

5. In the Title column, scroll down to the row that contains "Create
   SYSTEM.MDA." This row is usually located near the bottom of the SETUP.STF
   file.

6. In the Create SYSTEM.MDA row, go to the ObjID column (column 1), and write
   down the ObjID value.

7. Go to the Title column (column 3), and scroll to the row that contains "User
   Non File Work."

8. In the User Non File Work row, go to the Object Data column (column 6), and
   delete the ObjID value that you wrote down in step 6.

9. Go to the Title column (column 3), and scroll up to the row that contains
   "&Complete." This row is usually located near the top of the SETUP.STF
   file.

10. In the &Complete row, go to Object Data column (column 6), and add the
   ObjID value that you wrote down in step 6.

11. Save the SETUP.STF file as a delimited-text file.
