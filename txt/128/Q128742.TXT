SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks has a Custom Messages section located in the
MSMAIL.INI file used to initialize Microsoft Mail for Windows. Custom messages
allow the Windows client to pass message information to a Dynamic Link Library
(DLL) file. One DLL example is APPEXEC.DLL that is provided with the Simple MAPI
SDK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The operation map parameter found in the custom message declaration determines
when the DLL file will be called. Currently, with the Windows client, there are
eight possible events that can occur that will start the DLL when a specific
custom message is received. The eight possible operations are: compose, open,
reply, reply all, forward, print, save, and, upon delivery to the Windows client
Inbox.

IPC message types are special messages that the mail spooler does not place in
the Windows client Inbox. Of the eight possible operations, all require that the
message at least be placed in the Inbox. Due to this functionality, messages of
the IPC type do not work with custom messages.

To work with IPC type messages, it is necessary to use MAPI and the MAPIFindNext
function to read them, because they are not visible in the Inbox. For more
information on MAPI, consult the Microsoft Mail Technical Reference manual.
