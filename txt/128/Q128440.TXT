PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If administrators use the -SF (Simple Format addressing) switch they will need
to insure that all MSMail mailbox id's are no longer than 8 characters.

CAUSE
=====

MHS only supports sending to 8 character user names. MSMail names longer than 8
characters can normally be included in the extended address field. The -SF
switch disables the extended address field.

RESOLUTION
==========

If administrators need to use the -sf switch and disable extended addressing
they must ensure that all MSMail mailbox id's are 8 characters or less.
