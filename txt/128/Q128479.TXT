The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enter data in the Daily Sign-Up section, you cannot insert
International characters. International characters are necessary for typing
foreign names and addresses.

RESOLUTION
==========

To insert foreign characters into the Daily Sign-Up fields, use ASCII extended
characters:

1. Make sure the NUMLOCK key is on.

2. Hold down the ALT key and press the number keys on the numeric keypad that
   represent the desired character. For example, to enter an "E" with an umlaut
   placed above it, press ALT+0203 on the numeric keypad. This keystroke enters
   an ASCII extended character code.

The codes for the ASCII extended characters can be found in the lower-right
corner of the Character Map accessory screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Windows Character Map accessory provides you with extended
characters and special characters in symbol fonts that you can insert into other
applications.

For more information about Character Map usage, see your Windows printed
documentation or online Help.
