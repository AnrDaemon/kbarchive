SUMMARY
=======

To reference a time along with the date in a SourceSafe command, reference both
the time and the date by using the -vd switch.

For example, to list the history of the $/test project from 9am to 3pm on 3/3/95,
use this command:

   ss history $/test -vd3/03/95;3:00p~3/03/95;9:00a

In this command, 'a' or 'p' refers to AM or PM respectively. In addition, the '~'
is used to indicate the history between the date and times specified.

The order of the date and time arguments are important. The later date and time
should come first and the earlier date and time should come after the tilde. The
second time argument should also be less than the actual time you want returned.
For example, if you want the History back to "8:50", you should specify "8:49".
