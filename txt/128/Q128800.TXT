======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The compact disc for Windows NT Server version 3.5 includes a tool called the
Network Client administrator. This tool can be used to create boot disks and
setup disks for the setup of Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and The
Microsoft Network client version 3.0. However, this tool provides only a limited
selection of NDIS2 drivers.

This article describes a workaround for adding NDIS2 drivers that are not on the
Windows NT Server 3.5 compact disc. The information in this article is
applicable to any generic NDIS2 driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to add an NDIS2 driver to the Network Client administrator.

1. Copy the \Clients subdirectory from the Windows NT Server compact disc to
   your hard disk. This requires 49 megabytes (MB) of disk space.

   -or-

   To save disk space, copy just the \Clients\Msclient and \Clients\Wfw
   subdirectories. Also copy the file Ncadmin.inf to the \Clients subdirectory
   on your hard disk.

2. Share the \Clients subdirectory on your hard disk.

3. Copy the [netcard] section from your NDIS2 driver's Oemsetup.inf file to the
   [netcard] section of the file Wcnet.inf, found in the
   \Clients\Msclient\Netsetup subdirectory, if you're making a boot disk. Follow
   the same procedure for making a setup disk set, except add the changes to the
   file Wcnet.inf, found in the \Clients\Msclient\Disks\Disk1 subdirectory.

   For example, the following is the [netcard] section of the Compaq NetFlx
   driver's Oemsetup.inf file:

   [netcard]

   ms$netflx="COMPAQ Netflex
   ENET-TR",246,ndis,ethernet,real,ms$netflx,ms$netflx_nif
   ms$netflx2="COMPAQ Netflex-2
   ENET-TR",246,ndis,ethernet,real,ms$netflx,ms$netflx_nif
   ms$netflxt="COMPAQ Netflex-2
   TR",246,ndis,tokenring,real,ms$netflx,ms$netflx_nif
   ms$ntflx2t="COMPAQ Netflex-2 DualPort
   TR",246,ndis,tokenring,real,ms$netflx,ms$netflx_nif
   ms$ntflx2e="COMPAQ Netflex-2 DualPort
   ENET",246,ndis,ethernet,real,ms$netflx,ms$netflx_nif
   ms$cpqtok="COMPAQ 32-bit Dual-Speed Token Ring
   Adapter",246,ndis,tokenring,real,ms$netflx,ms$netflx_nif

4. Append the NDIS2 driver's header and NIF section from the Oemsetup.inf file
   to the Wcnet.inf file.

   For example, the following are the header and NIF sections of the Compaq
   NetFlx driver's Oemsetup.inf file:

   [ms$netflx]

   devdir= 1:NETFLX.DOS
   device=NETFLX.DOS,@DEVDIR\NETFLX.DOS

   [ms$netflx_nif]

   drivername=NETFLX$
   param=earlyrelease,"Early Release Option",keyonly,,,0x02
   param=maxrequests,"Maximum number of general requests",int,"3,10,1",
   <continued line> 3,0x02
   param=maxmulticasts,"Maximum number of multicast addresses",int,"1,
   <continued line> 50,1",16,0x02
   param=maxtransmits,"Maximum number of queued transmits",int,"3,50,1",
   <continued line> 10,0x02
   param=maxreceives,"Maximum Receive Buffers",int,"3,30,1",3,0x02
   param=maxframesize,"Maximum frame size",int,"256,17952,8",4096,0x02

5. In the appended header section of the Wcnet.inf file, remove the "devdir" and
   "device" lines. Add the line, "ndis2=1:<drivername>" and save the
   Wcnet.inf file.

   This is the resultant header section of the Wcnet.inf file in the Compaq
   NetFlx example:

   [ms$netflx]

   ndis2=1:NETFLX.DOS

6. Copy the NDIS2 driver to the \Clients\Msclient\Netsetup subdirectory. Follow
   the same procedure for making a setup disk set, except copy the NDIS2 driver
   to the \Clients\Msclient\Disks\Disk1 subdirectory.

   In the Compaq NetFlx example, copy the file Netflx.dos to the
   \Clients\Msclient\Netsetup subdirectory, or to the
   \Clients\Msclient\Disks\Disk1 subdirectory if you are making a setup disk
   set.

You can use the Network Client administrator to create the boot floppy disk for
this new NDIS2 driver, or the driver will be available in the installation disk
set. The new driver will then be available from the GUI interface of the Network
Client administrator.
