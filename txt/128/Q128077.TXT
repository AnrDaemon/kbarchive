TITLE   :PRB: Can't Use DOCKED or DOCKPOSITION Props to Dock a Toolbar
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the value of the DOCKED or DOCKPOSITION properties is modified to dock a
toolbar, the toolbar position does not change.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The DOCKED and DOCKPOSITION properties are
indicators of where a toolbar is located. They are Read Only properties and
modifying their value will not affect the toolbar.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the DOCK method to dock a toolbar along any border of the main FoxPro
window. The following code demonstrates how to use the DOCK method:

      oToolbar1=CREATEOBJECT('cToolbar')
      oToolbar1.Show
      = Messagebox("Moving the Toolbar")
      oToolbar1.Dock(0)
      = Messagebox( "Top")
      oToolbar1.Dock(1)
      =Messagebox( "Left")
      oToolbar1.Dock(3)
      =Messagebox( "Bottom")
      oToolbar1.Dock(2)
      =Messagebox( "Right")

      DEFINE CLASS cToolbar AS TOOLBAR
        Scalemode = 1
        * Make this a control array
        DIMENSION cmdim(3)
        ADD OBJECT cmdim(1) as CommandButton WITH caption = "One", Left =1
        ADD OBJECT cmdim(2) as CommandButton WITH caption= "Two", Left =10
        ADD OBJECT cmdim(3) as CommandButton WITH caption = "Three",Left= 15
      ENDDEFINE

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
