TITLE   :Printing Seems Slow on LANtastic-Shared Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are printing from a Windows-based application to a locally connected
printer on a system running Artisoft LANtastic version 6.0, it may take a long
time for the print job to finish.

RESOLUTION
==========

Increase the Characters Per Second setting in the Resources section of
LANtastic's Network Manager to print from a Windows-based application more
quickly.

To make changes to LANtastic's configuration, please refer to your LANtastic
documentation or contact Artisoft Technical Support.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you print to a locally connected printer from a Windows-based application
on a system running LANtastic version 6.0, all printing is carried out through
the networking software. Print jobs are not sent directly to the printer port.
This applies to Windows and Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11 running
without Windows for Workgroups peer network functionality.

You can configure LANtastic to specify how much relative CPU time is dedicated to
non-server and server-related activities. This option is specified in the
Characters Per Second parameter. LANtastic attempts to dedicate the necessary
CPU resources to a particular print job to sustain the characters per second
specified. When this setting is low (such as the default setting of 0) any
application activity on the server will slow the printing process considerably.

LANtastic is manufactured by Artisoft Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
