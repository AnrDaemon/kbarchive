TITLE   :PCM and PGC Fail to Execute Package from Servers with Long Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM kbPGC smspcm smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

There are two symptoms:

 - When you use a Windows 3.1 client to execute a package which requires
   utilities from the MSTEST directory and the logon server has a server name
   greater than 11 characters, the client receives the following error:

   Unable to connect. <errcode> - \\server\share. 2 - <followed by the
   actual universal naming convention (UNC) path used.>

   If you execute a package that does not require UNC access to the server, the
   symptom does not occur.

 - When you run the Program Group Control (PGC) that normally produces the
   shared application group, the following error appears:

   No server could be found for application

These symptoms usually on computers running Windows 3.1 in a NetWare environment
where logon servers can have names up to 47 characters in length.

These symptoms do not occur on clients running Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 3.1 KRNL386.EXE does not allow UNC paths with large server names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
