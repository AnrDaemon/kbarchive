KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Timex Data Link software with Schedule+ for Windows, the user
may receive the following error message:

   Cannot find VFORMS.DLL

The problem will only affect users who are running Microsoft Windows 3.1, not
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem was corrected in VFORMS.DLL version 3.2.0.4064. If you do not have
version 3.2.0.4064 (or later), the following self-extracting file is available
for download from the Microsoft Software Library:

   ~ Vformupd.exe
   (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Vformupd.exe)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Schedule+ for Windows does not include this DLL on any of the four installation
disks. VFORMS.DLL is a file used by Microsoft Mail for Windows versions 3.0b and
later. If you are running Windows for Workgroups, you have Mail built-in;
therefore, you have the DLL. Windows does not include Mail or the DLL.

Data Link for Windows is manufactured by Timex Corporation. For further
information, contact Timex technical support at 800-328-2677.
