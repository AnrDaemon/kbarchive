TITLE   :RASPHONE Hangs After Making PPP Connection To Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT 3.5 Remote Access application (RASPHONE.EXE) hangs after
connecting to a service provider using PPP. You are able to exit RASPHONE by
choosing End Task from the Task List, but you can continue to use RASPHONE until
you shutdown and restart Windows NT. Additionally, the modem remains connected
to the remote PPP server after you have forced RASPHONE application to end. You
are unable to use the modem with either RASPHONE or another communications
application until you shutdown and restart Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the remote PPP server sends an LCP echo request packet
with an illegal length. RASPPPEN.DLL performs no length checking on an echo
request.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
