SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from Lotus Notes in Windows NT to a printer with the printer name
longer than 32 characters, the following error message may appear:

   Cannot access printer or printer driver (may be due to insufficient memory)

CAUSE
=====

Lotus Notes maintains a 32-byte internal buffer size for file names. The long
file name of the printer is correctly reported, but Notes accepts only the first
32 characters. Therefore Notes is not able to locate the printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use a printer name shorter than 32 characters. To rename
a printer, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer, and then click Rename on the
   menu that appears.

Lotus Notes is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this products' performance or
reliability.
