PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbAudit kbInventory kbMaintMan smsinv smsaudit smsmaintman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you create too many inventory packages in the Microsoft Systems Management
Administrator and you run SMSLS.BAT from a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 computer
the following error message appears:

   The inventory output file has not been created.
   Run INVDOS /v to determine why.

When you run INVDOS /V you will see something similar to the following:

   Keyboard
   Dma
   Disks
   DriveA
   DriveB
   DriveC
   Volume
   DriveD
   Volume
   ConventionalMemory
   CMOSMemory
   ExtendedMemory
   XMSMemory
   DPMIMemory
   EMMMemory
   MouseInfo
   Video
   Video Skipped
   A hardware test failed

   The inventory output file has not been created.
   Run INVDOS /V to determine why.

   Done.

CAUSE
=====

This happens when the PKG_16.CFG file becomes to large.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Audit utility to inventory software instead of creating packages solely
for inventory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
