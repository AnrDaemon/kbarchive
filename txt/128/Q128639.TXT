TITLE   :MSDLC Hangs Computers Running Processor Speeds Over 66 MHz
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; :
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to load MSDLC.EXE in Windows or Windows for Workgroups with
computer processors running at speeds greater than 66 MHz and initiate the host
session, Microsoft Data Link Control (MSDLC) either does not respond to host
commands or the processor stops responding (hangs) forcing a system reboot.
MSDLC.EXE loads fine from MS-DOS.


CAUSE
=====

The timer routine is not set properly for Pentium processors resulting in
unnecessary network traffic. In addition, a FRMR routine ran due to the high
network traffic. This is not appropriate for the Class II, CCB II protocol in
the DLC stack. This causes the system to hang.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MSDLC. A fix to this problem for
Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2 and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version
3.11 is in development, but has not been regression- tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
