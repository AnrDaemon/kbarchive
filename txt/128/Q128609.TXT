SYMPTOMS

When you configure the video resolution of an IBM XGA-2 video adapter with IBM
9515 display monitor to a high resolution (for example, 1024x768 with 256
colors), the display may be skewed to one side.

The IBM 9515 display monitor synchronizes at refresh frequencies other than 75
Hertz, but it does not have adjustments to move the display vertically or
horizontally.

RESOLUTION

To correct this problem, run Control Panel, choose Display, and change the
Refresh Frequency to 75 Hertz.
