Changing the buffering mode through the Data tab of the Tools, Options dialog

sets the default buffering mode for any tables or cursors opened in successive
commands in the current instance Visual FoxPro.

WORKAROUND
==========

To change the buffering mode for a currently open table, use the CURSORSETPROP()
function in a program or in the Command window, or highlight the table and use
the Properties button in the View Window.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
