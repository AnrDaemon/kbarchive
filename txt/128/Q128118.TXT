======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run SNA Server Win3.x Client Setup the following error message
appears:

   No Windows network Installed

CAUSE
=====

Setup has failed to detect your network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server Win3.x Client Setup uses the following methods to check for various
LAN interfaces on Win3.x clients:

Named Pipes
-----------

If you are running Windows for Workgroups, Setup checks the SYSTEM.INI file for
the following:

   [boot]
   ...
   network.drv=wfwnet.drv


If you are running Microsoft LAN Manager or IBM LAN Requester, Setup looks for
LANMAN.INI or DOSLAN.INI, respectively. If both are found, Setup uses the
LANMAN.INI file. If either is found, Setup loads NETAPI.DLL and calls
NetWkstaGetInfo() to get the version information.

NetWare IPX/SPX
---------------

Setup calls LoadLibrary( "nwipxspx.dll" ). If that fails, Setup calls
LoadLibrary( "a:\nwipxspx.dll" ). If that succeeds, Setup tries to call
SPXInitialize() in that library.


SPXInitialize call fails if SPX is disabled. Some users disable SPX for memory
savings. The IPXODI /A command eliminates SPX support, causing the error message
to appear even if NWIPXSPX.DLL is installed.

TCP/IP Sockets
--------------

NOTE: The following text does not apply to SNA Server version 2.0 as it does not
include support for TCP/IP sockets.

Setup calls into WINSOCK.DLL to check for its presence. It needs to support
Windows Sockets version 1.1.

Banyan IP
---------

NOTE: The following text does not apply to SNA Server version 2.0 as it does not
include support for Banyan IP.

Setup calls LoadLibrary( "VNSAPI.DLL" ). If that succeeds, Setup considers Banyan
to be installed. Setup then calls VnsGetUserName() from that library to get the
default StreetTalk group name.
