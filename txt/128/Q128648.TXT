 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To create a list box that lists available system fonts in Visual FoxPro 3.0, you
need to use the AFONT() function. This function places information about
available fonts into an array. This array may then be used to populate a list
box on a form.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

The following procedure demonstrates how to create a form that contains a list
box that displays the available system fonts:

1. Open or switch to Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 3.0 and choose the New
   command from the File Menu. This will open the New dialog box.

2. Select the Program radio button. Then choose the New File button. This will
   open an empty Program Window.

3. Enter the following code into the Program Window:

      PUBLIC X
      X=CREATEOBJECT("myform")
      X.SHOW()

      ** Class Definition for the FORM object **
      DEFINE CLASS myform AS FORM

           SCALEMODE = 0
           TOP = 5
           LEFT = 5
           HEIGHT = 10
           WIDTH = 40
           ** Adding the COMBOBOX object into the form **
           ADD OBJECT mycombo AS Fontcombo

      ENDDEFINE

      ** Class Definition for the COMBOBOX object **
      DEFINE CLASS FontCombo AS ComboBox

          DIMENSION aFonts[1]
          aFonts = ""
          TOP = 2
          LEFT = 5
          HEIGHT=1.5
          WIDTH=30
          STYLE=2

          ** Init Method **
          PROCEDURE Init

          =AFONT(THIS.aFonts)
          THIS.RowSourceType=5
          THIS.RowSource="THIS.aFonts"
          THIS.Value=THISFORM.FontName

          ENDPROC

      ENDDEFINE

4. Choose the Do Program command from the Program Menu, and save the file when
   prompted. A form will now appear that contains a list box that displays the
   available system fonts.
