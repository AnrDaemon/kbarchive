TITLE   :BUG: "?" Command with Function "V1" May Not Display Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,2.5a,2.5b,2.6,2.6a,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "?" command with FUNCTION "V1", the characters "ii" or "il" or
"it" are displayed on the same line. Remove the single asterisk from the front
of the three commented lines in the code listed in the "Steps to Reproduce
Problem" section of this article. This extra code causes the V1 function to work
correctly with each font. It appears to work correctly when sent to a defined
window instead of the desktop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the "?" command with FUNCTION "V1" does not display correctly when
characters "ii" or "il" or "it" are in the string. The FUNCTION "V1" should
display only one character per line.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Run the following program:

   CLEAR

   *** Commented Code - See Workaround for Explanation***
   *DEFINE WINDOW FontHolder FROM 1,5 TO 30,20
   *ACTIVATE WINDOW FontHolder

   =AFONT(myfonts)
   m="iillittabc"

   FOR i = 1 TO ALEN(myfonts)

   FOR fontsize = 8 TO 11 ?m FUNCTION "V1" FONT myfonts(i),fontsize WAIT WINDOW
   ; "Font "+ALLTRIM(STR(i))+" of "+ ; ALLTRIM(STR(ALEN(myfonts)))+" - "+ ;
   myfonts(i)+' Size '+ALLTRIM(STR(fontsize)) TIMEOUT 2 CLEAR ENDFOR

   ENDFOR

   *RELEASE WINDOW FontHolder

NOTE: In certain fonts or sizes, the letters "ii", "ll" and "it" will appear on
the same line. Each letter should appear on a separate line.
