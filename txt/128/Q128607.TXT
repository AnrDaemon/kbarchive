TITLE   :Macintosh Chooser Cannot See SFM Servers Using Compaq PCI NIC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The installation of Services for Macintosh in Windows NT Server version 3.5
displays the AppleTalk zones and allows you to enable AppleTalk routing (or seed
an AppleTalk network). If you select an AppleTalk zone from a computer using a
Compaq Integrated PCI NetFlex network interface card (NIC), the server does not
appear in Chooser on the Macintosh client computer. If no zones are defined on
the network, the server does appear in Chooser on the Macintosh client computer.

CAUSE
=====

The Compaq driver for the integrated PCI NetFlex controller, PCNTN3.SYS, does
not transmit the server's default zone information out to the network.

WORKAROUND
==========

The older driver (version 1.99) from the Windows NT Server CD-ROM works
correctly. To see what driver you are using:

1. Open File Manager

2. Select the PCNTN3.SYS file in the \\%systemroot%\System32\Drivers directory

3. Choose Properties... from the File menu.

If the version number is 1.99, it is the older driver and should work.

If it is version number 2.00 or greater, the driver is from the Compaq SSD. If
so, follow these steps to install the older driver:

1. Rename the driver to PCNTN3.OLD

2. Open the Network component in Control Panel

3. Remove Services for the Macintosh

4. Remove the network card driver

5. Accept the change and reboot your computer

6. Open the Network component in Control Panel

7. Choose Add Adapter...

8. Select the AMD PCNET Family Ethernet Adapter and choose Continue

9. When prompted, type the full path to the PCNTN3.SYS driver on the Windows NT
   Server CD-ROM. For example:

   D:\DRVLIB\NETCARD\X86\PCNET\PCNTN3.SYS

   assuming "D" is your CD-ROM drive letter.

10. Accept the changes and reboot your computer again

11. Open the Network component in Control Panel

12. Re-install Services for Macintosh

13. Accept the changes and reboot your computer again.

The server should now be visible from the Macintosh Chooser.
