TITLE   :PROFS: Out-of-Memory Conditions in MS-GATE, MS-CSM, MS-GRF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.4a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.4a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Various out-of-memory conditions occur in MS-GATE, MS-CSM, or MS-GRF.

CAUSE
=====

When you process large files in MS-GATE, MS-CSM, or MS-GRF, a number of
conditions can result in which memory is used up.

RESOLUTION
==========

The PWASETUP EXEC was modified to require less virtual memory to operate on the
PROFS Host Access MS-GRF component.

You can reconfigure the mainframe side for more virtual memory. However, if you
have reached the maximum amount of virtual memory you can add to any PROFS Host
Access component machine (MS-GATE, MS-CSM, or MS-GRF), this component may offer
a solution to some of the memory constraints.
