SYMPTOMS
========

There is a known problem with using Oracle7 for Win32s with the Windows Sound
System version 2.0. The problem occurs when you are starting up a database in
the Database Manager. Oracle7 may stop responding (hang) during this process.
The computer will need to be rebooted.

CAUSE
=====

The SNDEVNTS.DRV file is causing the problem by performing stack checking on the

stack of Oracle7 causing the application to hang.
