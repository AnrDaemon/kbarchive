TITLE   :PROFS: Multiple Attachments Generated by Host Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.4a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.4a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an attachment from the local area network (LAN) to a DISOSS type
host, PROFS Host Access generates multiple attachments.

CAUSE
=====

When you send LAN-based messages with attachments to a DISOSS type host (this
includes SoftSwitch-based gateways and IBMMAIL), and those messages are
consistent with LAN_HOST DATA table DOC=N, an additional attachment is generated
and sent using the CMS SENDFILE command. This additional attachment can result
in an error message to the LAN, or these additional messages can accumulate in
the RSCS RDR or the MVS JES queue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.4a of Microsoft Mail
Gateway to PROFS. This problem was corrected in PWAATTS.XED version 3.4a.041. If
you do not have version 34a.041, you can find PWAATTS.EXE, a self-extracting
file, on the following services:
