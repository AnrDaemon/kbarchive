======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Host Access for IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.4a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


You are running the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS Host Access and an incident
report is sent to the "inform id" defined in "pwainit data." The first two lines
of the incident report are:

   Description: intermittent 'ABEND 0C4' would be reported by MS-RSCS.
   No data lost, becomes a PSS issue regarding cause.

CAUSE
=====

There is a flaw in the CSIEXIT Routine (MS3EXITF).

RESOLUTION
==========

When parsing through NJE header an had incorrect end condition was being tested.
There were 2 conditions: 1) I was testing if the next section is outside the
header, by comparing displacement with header length; 2) I was testing if
section type is zero. This was really "just in case" test, which usual worked.

Apparently the header length includes 4 bytes taken by length description word.
As a result one more section (which does not exist, but usually had zero in
"type" field) was being tested. In the case of one customer there was a file
from MVS which did not have zeroes at the end of last section, so the algorithm
went on until it hit memory boundary, resulting in an 0C4 abend.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.4 of Microsoft Mail
Gateway to PROFS and OfficeVision. This problem was corrected in version 3.4.041
