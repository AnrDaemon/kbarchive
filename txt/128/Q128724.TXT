The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When an application installs a Windows NT service, it may also install other
dependent services. If more than 13 dependent services are installed, you
receive the following error message when you stop the primary service:

   More data is available

None of the dependent services stop. If you manually stop the dependent services
until there are fewer than 13 running, stopping the primary service will
correctly stop all the dependent services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
