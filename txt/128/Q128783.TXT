TITLE   :RAS Clients Unable to Connect to NetWare Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you dial into a Windows NT server or workstation with Windows NT Remote
Access Service (RAS) clients, you are unable to connect to one or more NetWare
servers. You receives error 53 - "the network path was not found" when trying to
connect to or view a NetWare server's shares.

CAUSE
=====

The NWSAP Agent builds and maintains the table of servers by listening to all
SAP broadcasts (socket 452) on the network. When the RAS server service is
installed, this table is used to satisfy SAP requests from RAS clients. If the
NWSAP Agent receives an error (for example, a buffer overflows), the thread
responsible for handling the SAP broadcasts and maintaining the table may
terminate. When this happens, new entries are no longer added to the table and
any current entries are aged and removed from the table. The default time for
aging a SAP entry in Windows NT 3.5 is five minutes. Consequently, a new SAP
broadcast must be seen within the timeout period for the server to always be
available to RAS clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the service pack release containing this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
