The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT and Windows 95/98 support the creation of primary partitions and
logical drives that are larger than 2 gigabytes (GB). When you run File Manager
in Windows version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 to view a large
Windows NT drive, the maximum disk space (available or total disk space)
displayed is 1.99 GB.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since Windows version 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 operate with
MS-DOS, they are limited to a 16-bit FAT drive. The maximum cluster size for a
16-bit FAT drive is 64K, or 65,536 bytes (where 1K = 1024 bytes). In addition,
the maximum cluster size in MS-DOS is 32K, or 32,768 bytes. Therefore, the
maximum logical drive size in MS-DOS is calculated as follows:

   32K x 64K = 2048 MB = 2 GB

Although the maximum disk space that File Manager reports is 1.99 GB in Windows
version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, you can still access data
stored on the FAT, HPFS, and NTFS drives larger than 2 GB.


The maximum partition sizes under Windows NT are:

   
   +--------------------------------------------+
   | File System | Maximum Partition Size       | 
   +--------------------------------------------+
   | FAT         | 2^32 bytes (4 gigabytes)     | 
   +--------------------------------------------+
   | HPFS        | 2^41 bytes (2,048 gigabytes) | 
   +--------------------------------------------+
   | NTFS        | 2^64 bytes (16 exabytes)     | 
   +--------------------------------------------+

NOTE: 16 exabytes equals 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes.
