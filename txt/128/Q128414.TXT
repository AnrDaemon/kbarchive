======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

Upgrading an installation of the U.S. version of Windows NT to a version
localized for another country may render the Windows NT installation unusable,
and is not supported.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Setup finds Windows NT is already installed on your computer, when you
install a localized version of Windows NT, Setup prompts you to either upgrade
the existing version or to perform a separate installation. If you choose to
upgrade the existing U.S. version, you may render the Windows NT installation
unusable.

In one case, trying to "upgrade" from US version to the Japanese version resulted
in the following trap error:

   C000007B ( STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT), The application or DLL
   DosDevices\D:\WinNT35\userfont.fon is not a valid Windows NT image. Please
   check this against your installation diskette.

To correct this problem, reinstall Windows NT to a new directory.

Localized versions of NT ship with the Microsoft Developer Network CD-ROM (MSDN)
disk.
