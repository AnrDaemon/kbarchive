SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the functionality of the startup program VFPSTART.PRG.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The VFPSTART program has two main components:

 - When FoxPro is started after a new installation, VFPSTART minimizes the
   Command window and opens a new project.

 - VFPSTART adds the Class Browser option to the Tools drop-down in the System
   menu.

The VFPSTART application is launched from the CONFIG.FPW file. A COMMAND line is
added to your configuration file. Because the VFPSTART application interacts
with the Command window, it has to be called after the window has been defined.
Thus, it cannot be launched with the _STARTUP system memory variable.

If you need to modify the startup program, edit the file VFPSTART.PRG.

Additional query words: VFoxWin 3.00
