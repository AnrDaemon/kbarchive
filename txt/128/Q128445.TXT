SYMPTOMS
========

When a user without administrator rights sends a print job from a client
computer to a Windows NT computer that is using Line Printer Remote (LPR), Print
Manager displays errors and does not print the jobs.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when an administrator has denied non-administrator users
read and write permissions in the %SystemRoot% and SYSTEM32 directories.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, give non-administrators both read and write permissions
in the %SystemRoot% and SYSTEM32 directories.
