======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an MS-DOS-based application in Windows 95, the application may try
to exit Windows 95 or you may receive an error message similar to the following
message:

   This program does not run under Windows.

CAUSE
=====

Some MS-DOS-based applications are designed to check for the existence of
Windows and fail if Windows is found to be running.

WORKAROUND
==========

Windows 95 has an option for this type of MS-DOS-based application. Follow these
steps to use the "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows" option:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the icon for the MS-DOS-based program,
   then click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the Program tab, then click the Advanced button.

3. Click the "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows" check box,
   then click the OK button twice.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you choose the "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows"
option, Windows 95 does the following:

 - Removes WINDIR as an environment variable for that application.

 - Returns a message stating that Windows is not running if the MS-DOS- based
   application checks to see if Windows is running or what mode Windows is
   running in.


NOTE: If you use this option you cannot run Windows-based applications from this
command prompt.
