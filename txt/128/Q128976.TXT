-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a MultiTech MT2834 modem to receive calls using the Windows
NT Remote Access (RAS) Server service, the following message is written to the
Windows NT System Log:

   Event ID: 20050
   Source: RemoteAccess
   Type: Success Audit

   Description: ...The reason for disconnecting was hardware failure.

NOTE: Other information is also provided in the description message above, such
as the time connected, time disconnected, duration of the RAS connection, etc.

Event Viewer reports the reason for disconnecting is a hardware failure, even
when all aspects of the RAS session functioned as expected, and you choose the
Hang-Up button in the Remote Access application.


CAUSE
=====

According to MultiTech Systems, this behavior is caused by a problem with the
MultiTech MT2834 modem firmware. The MT2834 modem drops DSR before dropping DCD
causing the incorrect hardware failure message.

==========
