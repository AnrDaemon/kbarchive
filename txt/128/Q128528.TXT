SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to create a resizeable grid.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. In the Form Design, drop a grid control onto a form, and place it in the
   upper-left corner of the form. The easiest way is to add a table to the data
   environment. Then drag and drop the table from the Data Environment window to
   the form.

2. Add the following code to the Resize Event method of the Form:

      thisform.grid1.height=this.height
      thisform.grid1.width=this.width

3. Add the following code to the Init Event method of the form:

      thisform.grid1.height=this.height
      thisform.grid1.width=this.width

   This sizes the grid to the form upon startup,

4. Run the form, and resize the window. The grid will automatically size to fit.
