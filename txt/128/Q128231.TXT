                                          AVI file. It uses a 1:1

                        -Complete         This Indeo driver converts each
                         Basketball       video frame into a 9-bit per

                        -Encarta 95-97    color encoded scheme used for
                        -MS Office        natural pictures in which the

                        -Asimov           block  of the Indeo Video is a
                        -Scholastic's     square of 4-by-4 block of 16
                         Magic School     pixels. The brightness
                         Bus Explores     information "Y", 16 bytes is all

                         System           and 1 byte of "V"; the color
                                          information is kept. This totals
                                          18 bytes or 144 bits of
                                          information per block. Thus 9
                                          bits per pixel. This format
                                          stores its files in a sequence
                                          of three planes. Each plane
                                          represents one of the "Y," "V,"
                                          and "U" color space.

needed.
