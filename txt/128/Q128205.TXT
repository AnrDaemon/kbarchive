SUMMARY
=======

Data buffering is used in Visual FoxPro to enable edits to be made and verified
in memory before they are applied to a .DBF file and to handle some record
contention issues in a multiuser environment. There are several ways to use
buffering within Visual FoxPro. This article gives you an overview.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways to set the buffereing mode. Issue a SET MULTILOCKS ON, or
choose the Multiple Record Locks check box in the Data Tab of the Tools, Options
dialog to begin buffering data. Use one of the following methods to set the
buffering mode.

Setting the Buffering Mode Through the Visual FoxPro Interface
--------------------------------------------------------------

Use any one of the following methods to set the buffering mode through the Visual
FoxPro user interface:

 - To set the buffering mode for an open table, you can use the Properties
   button in the View Window. This method sets the buffering properties for the
   currently selected table only.

   -or-

 - To set the buffering mode for subsequently opened tables, you can use the
   Buffering list box in the Data tab of the Tools, Options dialog.

   -or-

 - In the form designer, you can set the form.BufferMode property to 1 for
   Pessimistic Buffering, or to 2 for Optimistic Buffering. If BufferMode is set
   to 1 or 2, table buffering is enabled for any cursor used by a grid control.
   Any other control bound to data uses row buffering. This property sets the
   default buffering mode for all tables used in the form.

   -or-

 - In the form designer, you can set the default buffering mode for individual
   cursors in the Data Environment by setting the BufferModeOverride property.
   The default for this property is 1 (Use the default buffering mode of the
   form).

NOTE: You cannot set a default buffering mode for a table through the Database
Designer.

Setting the Buffering Mode Programatically
------------------------------------------

To set the buffering mode programatically, you can use the CURSORSETPROP()
function to enable or disable buffering on an open table. The following line of
code sets Optimistic Row buffering:

      SET MULTILOCKS ON
      =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",3)

You must issue this line of code for each open table on which you wish to enable
buffering. This command overrides the default BufferMode property on a form, or
the default BufferModeOverride property for a cursor in the Data Environment for
the Form.
