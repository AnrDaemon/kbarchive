The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1995 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When completing the Registration Information in the Microsoft Complete Baseball
Daily, the City name must be longer than two characters, or you will receive the
following error message:

   The City is not filled out properly, please re-enter this data.

WORKAROUND
==========

Workaround 1
------------

Do not abbreviate city names if they are longer than two characters. Spell out
the City name completely.

For example:

   LA

Should be:

   Los Angeles

Workaround 2
------------

If the City name is only two characters, use the SPACEBAR key to enter a space at
the end of the City name.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Baseball 1995. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
