TITLE   :PRB: Polyline Fails with NULL Clipping Region
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Polyline API will return a failure code if called on a DC that has a NULL
clipping region selected. One situation in which this can occur is when Polyline
is used to draw into a DC for a window that is completely obscured by another
window.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check to see if the clipping region is NULL before calling Polyline and testing
its return value.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design on Windows 3.1.

This behavior does not occur on Windows NT or on Windows 95.
