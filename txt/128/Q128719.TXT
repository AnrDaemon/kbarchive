TITLE   :PRB: "Table or Row Buffering Requires that SET ..." Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing a CURSORSETPROP() function without first issuing a SET MULTILOCKS ON
command results in error number 1589. The error message is:

   Table or Row Buffering Requires that SET MULTILOCKS is set to ON

CAUSE
=====

You must enable multilocks prior to beginning to buffer through the
CURSORSETPROP() function or through the interface.

RESOLUTION
==========

Issue a SET MULTILOCKS ON command. You can handle this error in a program by
using this error routine:

      ON ERROR DO errhandler

        PROCEDURE errhandler

          =aerror(aLastError)
          DO CASE
             CASE aLastError(1) = 1589
                SET MULTILOCKS ON
                RETRY
          ENDCASE

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An on error routine should handle a variety of errors that may occur during
processing. Include an OTHERWISE section within the DO CASE construct to handle
errors that are not specifically included in the on error routine.

REFERENCES
==========
