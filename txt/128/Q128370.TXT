TITLE   :PC MAPI: MAPISendDocuments Removes Spaces in Filenames
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Simple Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) function
MAPISendDocuments, which is included with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks,
handles file names with space characters incorrectly. File names with spaces are
fairly common on advanced file systems, such as NTFS. MAPISendDocuments actually
removes the spaces and truncates the file name.

When you attempt to pass a file name with spaces in it MAPISendDocuments will
display the following error,

   The file "XXXXXXXX" could not be accessed

where XXXXXXX is the file name (with spaces omitted).

WORKAROUND
==========

All files passed to MAPISendDocuments should not contain space characters. If
you do have some files with spaces, rename the file to remove the spaces.

NOTE: Some development tools have functions that will convert the filename to a
standard MS-DOS 8.3 format. In Microsoft VC++ version 2.0, the function
GetShortPathName will convert the filename.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.20
