SoundBits version 1.0 installed, the system may stop responding (hang) or
display the error message:

   Application error in <title.exe>

Cancel button is the only option provided.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Broderbund attempts to make use of both the WAVE and MIDI device drivers for the
sound card. SoundBits takes over the sound card for opening sounds and will not
allow the Broderbund software access. According to Broderbund this error applies
to all Broderbund multimedia products that are not run from MS-DOS.
