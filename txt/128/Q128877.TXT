TITLE   :UT1x: Upsizing Wizard Does Not Allow Nulls in Foreign Key
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Upsizing Tools 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If after you have upsized Microsoft Access tables to Microsoft SQL Server, you
attempt to save a record in which you have entered a null in a foreign key
field, you may receive the following error messages

   ODBC insert failed on attached table '<Childtablename>'

and then:

   Cannot add or change record. Referential integrity rules require a related
   record in table '<Parenttablename>'

CAUSE
=====

The Upsizing Wizard creates an insert trigger when two tables with referential
integrity are upsized. Entering a null in a foreign key field causes an error
with this trigger. This error also occurs when you insert a record using the
Microsoft SQL Server tools, such as ISQL/w.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you must change the insert trigger to allow null
values in the foreign key field. Please see the "Steps to Reproduce Problem"
section of this article for an example of this resolution.

NOTE: This resolution assumes that you are familiar with Transact-SQL, the
programming language used in Microsoft SQL Server. For more information about
Transact-SQL, please refer to the "Transact-SQL Reference" manual for Microsoft
SQL Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Access Upsizing
Tools version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open the sample database NWIND.MDB.

2. Upsize the Categories table and the Products table, using all the default
   settings. The Categories table is the parent table, and the Products table is
   the child table; Category ID is the foreign key.

3. Attempt to enter a record in the newly attached Products table
   (Products_remote). Do not enter a value in the Category ID field. Note that
   you receive the error messages described earlier in this article.

To change the trigger to allow null values, change the original trigger created
by the Upsizing Wizard that reads as follows.

   ' Prevent inserts if no matching key in 'Categories'.

        IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inserted) !=
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Categories, inserted WHERE _
        (Categories.Category_ID = inserted.Category_ID))
         BEGIN
             RAISERROR 44447 "Cannot add or change record._
             Referential integrity rules require a related record in_
             table 'Categories'."
             ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
         END

to read:

   ' Prevent inserts if no matching key in 'Categories'.

        IF (SELECT Category_ID FROM inserted) IS NOT NULL
        IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inserted) !=
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Categories, inserted WHERE _
        (Categories.Category_ID = inserted.Category_ID))
        BEGIN
            RAISERROR 44447 "Cannot add or change record._
            Referential integrity rules require a related record in_
            table 'Categories'."
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
        END

NOTE: In the sample code above, an underscore (_) is used as a line- continuation
character. Remove the underscore from the end of the line when re-creating this
code.
