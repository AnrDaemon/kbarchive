TITLE   :PC Ext: External Reports Incorrect Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0a,3.2,3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0a, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade EXTERNAL.EXE from a previous version, the Mail External
program displays the incorrect version information.

CAUSE
=====

This may happen if you try to perform the upgrade while the Mail External
program is running, because both EXTERNAL.EXE and ASYNC.OVL are locked open
during the External process.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Stop the External Message Transfer Agent (MTA).

2. Backup the following files from the \MAILEXE directory using the MS-DOS Copy
   command:

   EXTERNAL.EXE
   ASYNC.OVL
   X25ATLAN.OVL
   X25EICON.OVL

3. Copy the new files to the existing \MAILEXE directory:

   EXTERNAL.EXE
   ASYNC.OVL
   X25ATLAN.OVL
   X25EICON.OVL

4. Start the External MTA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are three ways to display the version of the Mail External program:

1. Run the External program (recommended).

2. Type the following, and press ENTER:

   " External /?" (without the quotation marks)

3. Type the following, and press ENTER:

   "External /h" (without the quotation marks)

With version 3.2.16 of the Mail External program, the use of the command line
switches will result in an Invalid Option error, and then it will display
3.2.16, even if the .OVL files are incorrect. The preferred method of checking
the version is to run EXTERNAL.EXE.

All of the update files including EXTERNAL.EXE and all three .OVL files should be
copied to the \MAILEXE directory. When the Mail External program runs, it takes
the version number from all ASYNC.OVL files, even if the /CommDisable or -a
option is used. The Mail External program also checks the other .OVL files
(X25ATLAN.OVL and X25EICON.OVL) during an X.25 connection.
