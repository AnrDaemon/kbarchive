TITLE   :3Com 3C619B Fails Using Default Settings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you configure the 3Com TokenLink III network adapter (3C619B) with the
default settings (3Com mode) using the DOS Configuration utility (3TOKDIAG.EXE)
and start Windows NT, the following system events appear in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 5017 Source: tlnk3 Type: Warning Description: There is a memory
   conflict at address 0x0000000000000000.

   Event ID: 5000 Source: tlnk3 Type : Error Description: Has encountered a
   conflict in resources and could not load.

These symptoms occur sporadically.

CAUSE
=====

The driver tries to load into an illegal memory address of 0x0 if the adapter is
set for an I/O Port address of A20 or above.

These are the default settings of the 3C619B network adapter:

   Mode:        3com
   Base I/O:    A20
   Base (MMIO): CC000h
   Shared Ram:  D8000 - DBFFF
   Memory mode: 16
   I/O mode:    16

The Windows NT Diagostics (WINMSD) utility reports the following in the Adapters
option:

   Memory address      length
   0x0                 0x2000

   Port address        length
   0x110               0x4

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Configure the 3C619B network adapter to use an I/O port address below A20 in
   3Com mode.

   -or-

 - Configure the 3C619B network adapter as follows:

      Mode:        IBM
      Base I/O:    Primary
      Base (MMIO): CC000h
      Shared Ram:  D0000h
      Memory mode: 16
      I/O mode:    16

   In Windows NT, use the IBM Token Ring Adapter driver.
