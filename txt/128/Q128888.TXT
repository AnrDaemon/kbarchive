TITLE   :Network Adapter at I/O 320 Not Detected on Acer Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows 95, if the network adapter detection routine
determines that the PC is an Acer, the detection of network adapters at I/O
address 320h is bypassed.

CAUSE
=====

Setup does not check the range 320-32f on any computer with an Acer BIOS due to
restrictions for network adapter detection in the DETLOG.TXT file.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the network adapter to use a different I/O
address, or manually configure the network components in Windows 95 using a
custom Setup or maintenance-mode Setup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
