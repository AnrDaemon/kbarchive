SUMMARY
=======

There are several methods you can use to place a .NULL. value in a field at the
language level. However, there is only one pre-designated method for adding
.NULL. to fields through the interface.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only predefined method for adding .NULL. to a field manually is by using the
CTRL+0 (control+zero) key combination. The zero key must be the zero key on the
main keyboard, not the zero key on the numeric keypad. In Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh, you must use the zero on the numeric keypad. The zero on the main
keypad does not work.

If you'd prefer to use another key combination, use the ON KEY LABEL command. For
Example, you could use the following command when interacting with a BROWSE:

      ON KEY LABEL F12 DO ADD_NULL

After creating a procedure or program called ADD_NULL that contains this code:

      ON KEY LABEL F12                && Temporarily turn off routine.
      REPLACE (SYS(18)) WITH .NULL.   && Replace current field with .NULL.
      ON KEY LABEL F12 DO ADD_NULL    && Turn On Key Label back on.
