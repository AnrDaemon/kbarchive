TITLE   :PC DirSync: Err Msg: Error [ 81] No Mailbox Name Net/PO/
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, persistent errors during
Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) may be recorded in the DIRSYNC.LOG file
during the SRVMAIN -T (T2) process:

   Error [ 81] No mailbox NAME NET/PO/

CAUSE
=====

This error indicates that the transaction is missing the group address. This
happens when the GROUP.GLB file is corrupt or has been reset to 4 bytes without
deleting groups using ADMIN.EXE. The next time an administrator updates the
group, a transaction is put in the REQTRANS.GLB without the group name, even if
the group is excluded from Dir-Sync.

NOTE: This error should disappear in Keep Updates time.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Print out the members of groups from ADMIN.EXE by selecting Local-Admin,
   Group, Print, and choose either Printer or File.

   NOTE: Use this file to recreate the groups after deleting them.

2. Select Local-Admin, Group, Delete.

3. Delete all the groups.

Deleting the groups through ADMIN.EXE will remove the entries in ADMIN.NME, and
resolve the error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.12,
included with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
