TITLE   :PRB: Invalid Path or File Name Error on Novell Netware
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Visual FoxPro on a Novell Netware shell, the SET DEFAULT or CD
commands yield an "Invalid Path or File Name" error message.

CAUSE
=====

The NET.CFG or SHELL.CFG Novell Netware configuration files, do not contain a
SHOW DOTS statement. SHOW DOTS displays "." and ".." directory listings for
network directories and is OFF by default. As these entries represent the
current and previous directories, navigating along the directory structure can
be difficult if they are not available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Include the following statement in your SHELL.CFG or NET.CFG:

      SHOW DOTS=ON

STATUS
======

The error is not a bug in Visual FoxPro; it is the result of the Novell Netware
architecture.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

With no SHOW DOTS command or with SHOW DOTS = OFF, type the following in the
Command window:

      SET DEFA TO <valid drive letter>

Then type any of the following commands:

      SET DEFA TO ..
      SET DEFA TO ..\<valid subdirectory>
      SET DEFA TO .\<valid subdirectory>
      SET DEFA TO \<valid subdirectory>

REFERENCES
==========
