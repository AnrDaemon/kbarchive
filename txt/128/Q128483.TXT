KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Background colors assigned to windows, panes, or popups are not updated after
selecting a new color from the Color dialog. If a color is selected while the
Default Color checkbox is turned on, the background color is correctly updated.
However, if the Default checkbox is not turned on before selecting a new
background color and no other window property is modified, the background color
reverts to its previous state. As soon as any other property is modified, the
background color is updated.

CAUSE
=====

Background color states for an object are not updated properly when:

 - The Default Color checkbox is not turned on.

   -or-

 - No other property is modified in the Properties dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

To modify the background color for a window, pane, or popup, execute the
following steps:

1. Select Windows Definitions from the Section menu, and select the object to be
   modified.

2. Click the Properties button, and turn on the Use Default Color checkbox.

3. Click the Background Color browse button, and click the desired color.
   Previewing will now display the object with the selected background color.
   Modifying any other property in addition to the background color, will
   correctly adjust the object's background color.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
