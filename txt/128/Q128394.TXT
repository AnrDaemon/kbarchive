NOTE: Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs may hang when you play videos
using Diamond Stealth 64 Video VRAM version 2.05 card (none of the AVI files
play). To correct this problem, try changing color resolution from 256 to 64K
(or more) colors. Note that this may cause other programs to fail when you play
animations if they are not able to display at more than 256 colors.
