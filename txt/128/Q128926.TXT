 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the protected mode Windows 95 IPX/SPX compatible protocol the
remote control utility WUSER.EXE fails to load. It displays an error message
that it requires NWIPXSPX.DLL. In SMS Version 1.2, the error message "Unable to
initialize Multi-protocol support DLL IMP16.DLL" will occur when trying to load
the remote agent.

This file is a Novell NetWare DLL that is not shipped with Microsoft Windows 95
or Microsoft Systems Management Server. The DLL file is normally part of the
NetWare client installation, but if necessary, the file can be obtained from
Novell.

STATUS
======

This is by product design.
