TITLE   :Replacing Carriage Return & Line Feeds with Other Characters

KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to have a program process a file to replace
carriage returns and line feeds with a double dollar sign. You can modify the
code to use a character other than the double dollar sign by replacing the
double dollar sign ASCII value (CHR(36)) with some other appropriate ASCII
value. The code in this article also demonstrates how to use low level file
functions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following program takes two parameters:

 - The file that needs carriage returns and line feeds removed (file1).

 - The file name to write to (file2).

Sample Code
-----------

   PARAMETER file1,file2
   PRIVATE fhandle_in,fhandle_out,fisize,inchar

   fhandle_in=FOPEN(file1,2)
   IF (fhandle_in#-1)                 && open read/write buffered
      fhandle_out=FCREATE(file2)      && default read/write
      fisize=FSEEK(fhandle_in,0,2)    && get the size of the file
      =FSEEK(fhandle_in,0,0)          && reposition pointer to beginning of
                                      && file
      x=1
      DO WHILE (x<=fisize)            && process the whole file
         inchar=FREAD(fhandle_in,1)   && read 1 byte at a time
         IF ((inchar = CHR(13)) .OR. ;
             (inchar = CHR(10)))
             *** change the replacement character '$$'
             *** by changing the CHR value below
            =FWRITE(fhandle_out,CHR(36)) && replace crlf with $$
         ELSE
            =FWRITE(fhandle_out,inchar)  && write the character to file
         ENDIF
         x=x+1                           && increment the variable
      ENDDO
      =FCLOSE(fhandle_in)                && release the file handle to close
                                         && file1
      =FCLOSE(fhandle_out)               && release the file handle to close
                                         && file2
      MODIFY FILE &file2                 && opens the target file for viewing
   ELSE
      RETURN .F.                         && could not open the input file
   ENDIF

How to Use the Sample Code
--------------------------

To demonstrate the code example, copy it into a new program file, and save it as
TEST.PRG. Then from the Command Window, type:

      Do TEST.PRG with "C:\TEST.TXT", "C:\TEST1.TXT"

NOTE: Please note that file names passed to a program as parameters must be
enclosed by quotation marks.

Here C:\TEST.TXT is the file that needs carriage returns and line feeds removed,
and C:\TEST1.TXT is the name of the new file.
