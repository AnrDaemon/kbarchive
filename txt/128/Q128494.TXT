SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use File Filtering in Microsoft Backup to exclude all file types
except a certain type, additional files that you did not intend to include are
selected for backing up.


CAUSE
=====

You can use the File Filtering option in Microsoft Backup to exclude only
registered file types. All non-registered files in a selected drive or folder
will be selected for backing up, regardless of whether you use the File
Filtering option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To include only a particular group of files in a drive or folder for backing up,
use one of the following methods:

 - Manually select the files you want to back up by clicking the icon for the
   drive or folder containing the files and then clicking the files in the right
   side of the window.

 - Register all non-registered file types in the drive or folder that contains
   the files you want to back up. Or, remove all the non- registered files in
   the drive or folder. Then, use File Filtering to exclude the file types you
   do not want to back up.

 - Store the files you want to back up in a new folder and then select the
   entire folder for backing up.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Registered file types are associated with a particular application. Once you
register a file type you can specify which application should be used to open,
print, or perform some other action on files of that type. You can specify a
different application for each action, or use the same application for all
actions.

For example, files with a .TXT extension are registered under the file type Text
Document. Text Document files are typically associated with the Notepad
application, so that application is used by default to open or print files of
that type.

Because the Text Document file type is registered in this manner, you can open a
.TXT file in Notepad by double-clicking it, or print the file by dragging it to
a printer and dropping it. You can also exclude .TXT files from being backed up
because they are registered properly.
