SUMMARY
=======

Some MS-DOS-based games require an 8-bit direct memory access (DMA) channel
setting for the sound card to provide sounds. Games known to require an 8-bit
DMA channel setting include:

 - Renegade: Battle for Jacob's Star

 - Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the sound card in your computer is set for a 16-bit DMA channel (5, 6, or 7),
use Device Manager to change the card's configuration to use an 8-bit DMA
channel (0, 1, or 3).

You may also need to run the configuration tool that is included with the sound
card to change its DMA channel setting to match the setting in Device Manager.
If no configuration tool is included with the sound card, you may need to change
jumpers on the card.

Changing the DMA Channel in Device Manager
------------------------------------------

To change the DMA channel for the sound card in Device Manager, follow these
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. Click the Device Manager tab, then double-click Sound, Video, And Game
   Controllers.

4. Double-click the sound card that is installed in your computer.

5. Click the Resources tab.

6. Double-click Direct Memory Access, then change the DMA setting to the setting
   you want.

7. Click OK. When you are prompted to do so, restart your computer.
