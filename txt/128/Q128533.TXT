TITLE   :Cannot Type Simplified Chinese with MS PingYing in Taiwan Locale
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Pan Chinese Edition, version 4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Simplified Chinese characters display as garbled text in the Taiwan locale of
Pan Chinese Windows NT Workstation when you use the MS PingYing input method to
type the characters.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the Taiwan locale cannot display GB or GBK coded Chinese
characters (such as Simplified Chinese). The Taiwan locale only displays BIG5 or
Unicode-based Chinese Characters.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
