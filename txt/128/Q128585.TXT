SUMMARY
=======

An asynchronous instance of External may occasionally fail to answer an incoming
call. When this happens, the phone rings several times, the modem does not go
off-hook, and the line is not picked up. The caller will see a No Answer
response to the dial attempt. If the caller attempts a second call, the call
will often go through without any problem.

For the best results, set up separate instances for your asynchronous connections
and for these instances, include the MailerDisable and DispatchDisable options
in the EXTERNAL.INI file.

NOTE: There must be another instance of External that can perform the Mailer and
Dispatch functions before the options mentioned above can be used. Other steps
can be taken to minimize the chance of unanswered calls. See the section below
for additional information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

External is coded to poll for incoming calls. Thus, External will periodically
check the communications channel for activity. Ordinarily, External will reach
one of these polling points during the rings of an incoming call, and it will
pick up the call.

When factors exist that effect the performance of External, that is, slow its
cycle, there will be an increased chance of not reaching the polling point while
the call is occurring.

Here are some factors that can slow External and cause missed incoming calls:

   Slow Network Links
   Congested Network Links
   Slow Server Response
   Slow PC used for External
   Defective Hardware

These factors should be investigated and conditions improved, if possible.

If a wide area network is involved, it might be possible to use the DrivesWAN
option of External. This is similar to using the DispatchDisable and
MailerDisable options, but does not require a second External at the local site.
DrivesWAN does require that there be other External programs running at other
sites.

Also, External will not answer incoming calls while it is updating information
from one of the postoffices. Checks for updates occur at regular intervals
determined by the IntervalUpdate parameter. An update does not occur at every
check, but if changes have been made through the Administrator's program
(ADMIN.EXE) or Import program (IMPORT.EXE), then the update takes place. The
update interval can be increased so that checks occur less frequently and at
more controlled times of the day.
