SYMPTOMS
========

While you run the Administration program (ADMIN.EXE) for versions 3.2 and 3.2a
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, you may get the following error:

   Notice XXX - Error File not Accessible Check Server Connection

Rather than the error:

   Notice 21 - Name already defined as a user mailbox.
