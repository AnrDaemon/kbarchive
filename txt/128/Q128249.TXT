OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy files to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) NetServer computer using a 3Com
3C679 network interface card (NIC) with an 8-bit IBMTOK.SYS driver, Windows NT
3.5 may stop responding (hang) or the copied files may become corrupted. The NIC
is not on the Windows NT 3.5 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run the EISA Configuration utility for the computer
and set the NIC data path width value to 8 bits. The default value is 32 bits.
