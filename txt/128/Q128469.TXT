TITLE   :PROFS: Err Msg: PWAMROUT Novalue Error in Line 222
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.4a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.4a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


The following error message is displayed on the MS-GATE PROFS Host Access
Component:

   PWAMROUT novalue error in line 222

CAUSE
=====

In the PWAMROUT CEXEC, line 222 contains an invalid Interpret command.

RESOLUTION
==========

In line 222 of the PWAMROUT CEXEC, change the following statement

      Interpret 'sub = ' ' '"'Recurring_Txt.Default_Lang || Sub '"'

   to:

      sub = Recurring_Txt.Default_Lang Sub

Although in theory these two statements should produce the same results, in
practice the first one produces a "No Value" error.

======

Gateway to PROFS. This problem was corrected in PWAMROUT.CEX version 3.4a.041.
