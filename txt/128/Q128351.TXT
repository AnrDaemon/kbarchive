-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following two topics are incorrectly documented in chapter 2 of the Network
Operations Quick Reference (NETOPS.HLP) included on the Windows NT Server
version 3.5 CD:

 - Promoting a Server to Primary Domain Controller

 - Demoting a Primary Domain Controller to Backup

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Promoting a Server to Primary Domain Controller" topic states:

   When a server is promoted to primary domain controller, an up-to-date copy of
   the user account database is replicated from the old primary domain
   controller to the new one, and then the old primary domain controller is
   automatically demoted to backup domain controller (unless it is not currently
   running).

The "Demoting a Primary Domain Controller to Backup" topic states:

   Usually, when a server is promoted to primary domain controller, no special
   action needs to be taken to demote the former primary to backup domain
   controller because the system does this automatically.

   However, if a server is promoted to primary domain controller while the
   existing primary domain controller is unavailable (for example, if it is
   being repaired), and the former primary domain controller later returns to
   service, you must demote it.

Both of these topics incorrect indicate that a server can be promoted to a PDC.
To promote a server to domain controller status you must reinstall Windows NT
Server.
