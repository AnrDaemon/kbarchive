SUMMARY
=======

If you install an OEM-supplied printer driver designed for Windows version 3.x
and then later reinstall Windows 95, any configuration information for that
driver may be lost.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Windows 95, Setup automatically updates any printer driver for
which there is a Windows 95 driver using a default configuration. If you need to
use a driver designed for version 3.x, you will have to reinstall and
reconfigure it after reinstalling Windows 95.
