TITLE   :UT1x: No Referential Integrity Triggers Using Upsizing Tools
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbEnableSight kbEnableMove

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Upsizing Tools 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upsize two tables from Microsoft Access with the Upsizing Wizard,
referential integrity triggers are not created.

CAUSE
=====

There is an outer join between the two tables. To check the relationship type
for the tables, choose Relationships from the Edit menu, double-click the line
between the two tables, and then choose the Join Type button. If join type 2 or
3 is selected, it is an outer join.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the join type to an equi-join rather than an outer join. The only effect
that using an outer join in the relationship has (other than causing this
problem) is that this join will be the default join when you create a query
based on these two tables.
