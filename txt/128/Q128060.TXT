TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Open a General Field from a FoxPro 2.x Table
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.6,2.6a,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro version 3.0, if you open the Object General field in the
OLETABLE sample table that shipped with FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows, you see
this error:

   OLE object is invalid or corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

The error is specific to this particular table. The structure of the OLETABLE
sample table has an obsolete format that was used in pre-released versions of
FoxPro version 2.5. FoxPro version 2.6 can read this obsolete format, but Visual
FoxPro version 3.0 cannot.

WORKAROUND
==========

Update the table in FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows:

1. Run FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows, and open the OLETABLE file with the USE
   command.

2. Browse the table by using the BROWSE command and open the OBJECT General
   field by double-clicking to activate the OLE server.

3. Modify the field in some way, but don't save the changes.

Repeat these three steps for records number 1, 2, and 3. This will cause the
table to be saved in a FoxPro version 2.6 format. Once it is in a version 2.6
format, you will be able to open it and browse it in Visual FoxPro for Windows.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
