-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If two LPR clients simultaneously run LPQ commands recursively to a Windows NT
LPD server, within approximately 30 to 40 seconds, the LPD service on the
Windows NT computer stops responding (hangs). If one LPR client runs LPQ
commands recursively, the Windows NT LPD server may hang several hours later.


WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
3.51.

To work around this problem, restore the LPD service, after it hangs, by
rebooting the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 3.51.
