KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When there is no tape in the drive and you use the AT command without the
interactive switch to run Windows NT Backup, the backup encounters an error or
is unable to accept the command line. As a result, Windows NT Backup stops
responding (hangs); you cannot run Windows NT Backup again until you restart
Windows NT.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use the /INTERACTIVE switch with the AT command to open the interactive desktop.
If any errors occur, you will be able to correct them and continue or quit
Windows NT Backup.

EXAMPLE:

AT 11:00PM /interactive /every:m,t,w,th,f,sa,su c:\Atbackup.cmd

To use the /interactive switch you must configure the scheduler service to log on
as the SYSTEM ACCOUNT and "Allow Service To Interact With Desktop" by using
Control Panel - Services, highlight Scheduler and pressing the Startup button.
