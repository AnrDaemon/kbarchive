SUMMARY
=======

Page 532 of the Microsoft Systems Management Server Systems Guide states the
following for the DOS Inventory Agent (INVDOS) command line options:

   /n Instructs the Inventory Agent to request a unique computer name.

This is incorrect. The /m switch instructs the Inventory Agent to request a
unique computer name. For a correct list of the DOS Inventory Agent command line
options, type INVDOS /? at the MS-DOS Command Prompt.
