TITLE   :Bad .RAW File Hangs Inventory Processor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

No new inventory shows up in Personal Computer Properties, .RAW files continue
to get added to the SMS\SITE.SRV\INVENTRY.BOX directory on the site server, and
the inventory processor appears to be hung. In some cases, the SMS_EXECUTIVE
will stop suddenly.

CAUSE
=====

SMS has no mechanism to pass over a bad .RAW files. As a result, bad .RAW files
passed to the INVENTRY.BOX directory on the Site Server, remain in that
directory without being processed and all other inventory files will backup
behind it.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop SMS_EXECUTIVE, remove the bad .RAW file, and
restart SMS_EXECUTIVE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
