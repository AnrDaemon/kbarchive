TITLE   :PC Forms: Err Msg: Bad Command Line (on Delivery)

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive a message containing an electronic form created with version
1.0 of Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, you may receive the following
error:

   Bad Command Line

This error will occur when the message is initially received, but it will not
occur if the user attempts to open the same message after it has been delivered.

CAUSE
=====

This will occur in the MEFPhone sample, MEFRoute sample, or any E-forms created
using the Template project and the custom command declaration in either
SHARED.INI or MSMAIL.INI that specifies the form should be activated on
delivery. By default, there is no code in the Template project to support
activation on delivery. To check to see if the form is installed to be activated
on delivery or not, see if the array position 7 (position 0 to 15) is 1 or 0 on
the form declaration entry in MSMAIL.INI or SHARED.INI.

Below is an example of a form declaration where the array position 7 (the 8th
flag) of the operation map is set to 1 for activation upon delivery.

      [Custom Messages]
      ; all should be on the same line

      IPM.Microsoft.MEFPhone=3.0;;Telephone
       Note;;C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MEFLIB.DLL;<MC:IPM.Microsoft.MEFPhone>
      C:\EFORMS\PROJECTS\PHONE\MEFPHONE.EXE -MSG <COMMAND>
      <MESSAGEID>;1111111100000000;Microsoft Sample Telephone Note;;;

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this error, it is necessary to add support for activation on
delivery. The following steps will modify the Template project so that any new
forms created will support opening the form on delivery. Any existing projects,
including the MEFPhone and MEFRoute samples would need to be modified in a
similar manner to support this functionality.

1. From Microsoft Visual Basic, open the Template project.

2. Open the EFORM.BAS file included with the project.

3. In the Proc: window, select ParseCommandLine.

4. Locate following the program line:

   Select Case gCommand

5. Three lines below that, you should find the following code fragment:

         ----------
         Case wcommandOpen
                     If gMessage.Flags And MAPI_SENT Then
                         frmRead.Show
                     Else
                         frmCompose.Show
                     End If
         ----------

   Change it to read:

         ----------
         Case wcommandOpen, wcommandDelivery
                     If gMessage.Flags And MAPI_SENT Then
                         frmRead.Show
                     Else
                         frmCompose.Show
                     End If
         ----------

6. Save changes to the Template project.
