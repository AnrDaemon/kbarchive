SUMMARY
=======

This article gives you step-by-step instructions for building a 16- or 32-bit
DRVSETUP.EXE by using Visual C++.

NOTE: When DRVSETUP.EXE is built by BUILD.BAT and makefile under
\ODBCSDK\DRVSETUP.KIT, 3d controls inside dialog boxes don't work. Buttons are
not displayed in the right positions. You can overcome this problem by using
Visual C++ Workbench and App Studio.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To build a 16-bit DRVSETUP.EXE using Visual C++ version 1.5x:

1. Copy ODBCVER.H and CTL3D.H from \ODBCSDK\INCLUDE into \ODBCSDK\DRVSETUP.KIT;

2. Launch App Studio. Open DRVSETUP.RC, and choose Save as from the File menu,
   save the file as type "Resource Files(*.res)"; and then open DRVSETUP.RES,
   choose Save as from the File menu, save the file as type "Resource
   Scripts(*.rc)". A dialog box will pop up and ask you whether or not to
   overwrite the old version of resource file; click OK.

3. Launch Visual Workbench.

4. From the Project menu, choose New to create a project named drvsetup. Add
   DRVSETUP.C, DRVSETUP.DEF, and DRVSETUP.RC to the project.

5. From the Options menu, choose Project, and select Linker. Add odbcinst and
   ctl3ds to Input Libraries.

6. From the Options menu, choose Directories, and add C:\ODBCSDK\INCLUDE to the
   beginning of the Include File Path and C:\ODBCSDK\LIB to the beginning of
   Library Files Path.

7. From the Project menu, choose Build DRVSETUP.EXE.

To build a 32-bit DRVSETUP.EXE using Visual C++ version 2.x:

1. Copy ODBCVER.H and CTL3D.H from \ODBCSDK\INCLUDE into \ODBCSDK\DRVSETUP.KIT.

2. Open DRVSETUP.RC and choose Save as from the File menu, save the file as type
   "Resource Files(*.res)"; and then open DRVSETUP.RES, choose Save as from the
   File menu, save the file as type "Resource Scripts(*.rc)". A dialog box will
   pop up and ask you whether or not to overwrite the old version of resource
   files. Click OK.

3. From the File menu, choose to create a new project and name it drvsetup,
   setting the Project Type to Application.

4. From the Project menu, choose Settings and then Link. Add ODBCCP32.LIB and
   CTL3D32S.LIB to the Object/Library Modules;

5. From the Tools menu, choose Options and then Directories. Add
   C:\ODBCSDK\INCLUDE to the beginning of the Include Files path and
   C:\ODBCSDK\LIB32 to the beginning of the Library Files path.

6. From the Project menu, choose Build, and build DRVSETUP.EXE.
