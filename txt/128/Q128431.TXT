TITLE   :MHS: Err Msg: Gateway Doesn't Support Gateway "{}" Originators
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send mail from Microsoft Mail for PC Networks through the MHS gateway
to CompuServe and then on to the Internet, the following error appears:

   The message you sent on <date> <time> could not be delivered to:

   mail @ cserve {internet:<userid>@<site>},

   The MHS gateway does not support gateway "{}" originators.

CAUSE
=====

The CompuServe to Internet gateway does not support curly braces ({}). When you
send a message from MHS through CompuServe to the Internet, the CSERVE/Internet
gateway tries to build a return address. The gateway cannot build the return
address because the Microsoft Mail addresses are in the following format:

   <user>@MSMail {<network>/<postoffice>/<user>}

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have a single postoffice, you can use simple addressing, which allows you
to send mail to <user>@MSMail. To configure the gateway for simple
addressing, add the -SF switch to the gateway command line. This command-line
option is configured within the MHS administrator program (MHS.EXE for version
1.5, and NGMADM for NGM). You should still send outgoing mail using the same
addressing; for example, [MHS:MAIL@CSERVE
{INTERNET:<USERID>@<SITE>}. Simple addressing does not work for
downstream postoffices.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have multiple postoffices, the only solution is to purchase multiple
copies of the gateway and set up each postoffice as a gateway postoffice.
