OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use HP 10/100 VG ANYLAN network interface card (NIC) with the
corresponding Windows NT driver (HP J2573A ISA), Network Monitor goes into an
unusable state (and won't shut down) when you attempt to start a capture.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occus when Network Monitor makes statistic queries.

WORKAROUND
==========

HP will soon be releasing a new version of this driver. You can work around this
problem by using a beta version of this driver (available from the HP Internet
FTP site).

The driver (HPFEND.SYS) supports ISA, EISA, and PCI VG cards. There are different
OEMSETUP.INF and .DLL files for each card type.

To use the beta driver:

1. Get J2585A.EXE from the HP FTP site:

   ftp ftp-boi.external.hp.com (192.6.71.2)
   User: anonymous
   Password: email-address
   pub/computer_products/network directory
   binary

2. Locate the HP VG ISA Support Disk (A.00.03) or download J2573A.EXE from the
   HP FTP site.

3. Format a floppy disk.

4. Copy the contents of the \WINNT directory from the HP VG ISA disk to the root
   of the newly formatted floppy disk. Also, copy the file \DISK1 from the HP VG
   ISA disk to the root of the new floppy.

5. Extract HP VG PCI drivers disk archive (J2585A.EXE) to hard disk.

6. Overwrite \HPFEND.SYS on the new floppy with \BETA\HPFEND.SYS from the HP VG
   PCI archive.

7. On the Windows NT computer, remove the old ISA driver and then install the
   new driver from the floppy disk.
