TITLE   :MHS: Circular Routing Through the MHS Gateway
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Nondelivery messages do not leave the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) MHS
gateway queue. The messages never seem to be delivered and no error message is
returned.

CAUSE
=====

The "stuck" messages are actually messages from the postmaster at MSMail to the
postmaster at MSMail. The gateway tried to deliver a message to POSTMAST@MSMAIL
{NET1/PO1/POSTMASTER}. However, the user did not create a postmaster account;
therefore, the External Mail program generated a nondelivery notice and sent it
back to the originator, which was also POSTMAST@MSMAIL {NET1/PO1/POSTMASTER}.
Since the mail was routing through the MHS gateway each cycle, the External Mail
program never had the opportunity to consider it as a circular route.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a postmaster account on every postoffice that will be sending or
receiving mail through the MHS gateway.
