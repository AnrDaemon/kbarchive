TITLE   :PC MAPI: MAPI Messages w/ Space in Message Type Fail to Print
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a custom message using the Messaging Application Program
Interface (MAPI), you may not be able to print or save the message to a text
file.

WORKAROUND
==========

The MapiMessage MessageType should not contain any space characters in the
string, or keep the message type letters the same case.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks. We are researching the problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This happens when the developer constructs the MapiMessage structure and defines
the MessageType string. The MessageType is in the form:

   IPM.VendorName.subclass

If a white space character is used in the VendorName field of the MapiMessage
MessageType, the message may not print or save correctly. For example,

   IPM.Test Message.Note

Also, if you leave all the characters lowercase, the problem does not occur. It
is only when using the space in conjunction with the leading capital letters.

This problem can occur when you use one of the following versions of MAPI.DLL:

   MAPI.DLL 11-1-93 53,536 (Windows for Workgroups version)
   MAPI.DLL 3-9-93 54,384 (Update from MAPIUPD.EXE on the MSL)

Additional query words: 3.00 3.20
