SUMMARY
=======

If a form is designed in a resolution higher than that of the target display
device, objects on the form may be off the screen. Form Designer can be set to
limit the maximum area in which a form can be created to correspond with the
lowest resolution monitor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The maximum design area must be set before Form Designer is used to create
a form. The setting will have no effect on forms previously created at different
resolutions.

To set the maximum design area, choose Options under the Tools pad on the system
menu bar. Select the Forms tab. Then choose the desired Maximum Design Area
setting from the drop-down list. Generally, you need to select the 640 x 480
resolution to enable a form run on a higher resolution monitor to display all of
the items on the form.

Regardless of what resolution the form is created under, Form Designer will not
allow the form dimensions to exceed the setting indicating the maximum display
resolution of the target monitor. This avoids generating "Position is off
screen" errors due to creating a form that addresses areas of the display screen
that are available only at higher resolutions.

To save this setting as the default, choose the Set as Default command button.
Then choose OK to close the Options window.
