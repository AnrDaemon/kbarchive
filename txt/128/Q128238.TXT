TITLE   :BUG: SourceSafe Update Command Fails on Large Binary File
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe310bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for MS-DOS, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Macintosh, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for UNIX, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A large binary file cannot be updated in SourceSafe.

CAUSE
=====

Insufficient resources to create the difference file.

RESOLUTION
==========

If it is not possible to increase the HMA by decreasing the number of drivers
necessary for a given system, try putting all binary files in a subproject, and
put the following line in the project header for that subproject:

   Store_Deltas = No

This will turn off the calculation of differences (storing the entire file) for
this subproject only.

For example, you may want to organize your projects as shown in the documentation
(User Guide Chapter 2 Overview), with a subproject containing the binary files:

        $/-
          |
          TESTDATA
             |
              -BINARIES

Such that:

   [$/TESTDATA/BINARIES]

would be a subproject header. Put this line under the subproject header in the
SS.INI file for each user:

   Store_Deltas = No

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.
