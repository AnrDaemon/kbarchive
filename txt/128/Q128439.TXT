TITLE   :MHS: Err Msg: Cannot Open NETDIR.TAB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear in the MHSGATE.LOG file:

   Cannot open netdir.tab.

Also, hundreds of temporary files may be created in the MHS\SW directory.

CAUSE
=====

MHS uses the NETDIR.TAB file to assign unique filenames. If the NETDIR.TAB file
is not available, INPOST.EXE cannot move a message from the Microsoft Mail
database to the MHS system. If a message cannot be delivered properly to MHS,
the INPOST.EXE program may create enough files so that the NETDIR.TAB file
cannot allocate an additional unique filename.

RESOLUTION
==========

Deleting the hundreds of files in the MHS\SW directory should resolve this
problem temporarily. Check the MHS queue list (by selecting Queue, MHS from the
Mail Administrator program) to see if there is a file that is addressed to an
invalid user. Also, ensure that a POSTMASTER mailbox has been created for the
gateway postoffice.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If no POSTMASTER mailbox exists, and if a message is addressed incorrectly, a
recursive loop will be created. Each attempt to deliver a message to the
postmaster generates an additional nondelivery message addressed to the
postmaster. This can cause the MHS\SW directory to become full and will cause
the above error.
