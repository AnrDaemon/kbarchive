======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Device Manager may show an Unknown Hardware class.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not know what the hardware is.

RESOLUTION
==========

Try to determine what the hardware is, then contact the hardware's manufacturer
about obtaining a Windows 95 driver and .INF file for the device.

You may be able to determine what the hardware is by a process of elimination.
For example, try to identify all the devices on the system until only one is
left. The last device is probably the unknown device.
