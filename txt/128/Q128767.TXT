TITLE   :DriveSpace Does Not Compress Existing Drive

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using DriveSpace to compress an existing drive, the mini- Windows
portion of DriveSpace does not load.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you are using a Diamond SpeedStar Pro VLB video
adapter, and the following line has been removed from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   C:\UTIL1\SPEED\PROMODE MONITOR

This line is needed in order for the video adapter to support VGA mode in
mini-Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, follow these steps:

1. Add PROMODE.EXE to the [FAILSAFE] section of the DRVSPACE.INF file.

2. Copy the PROMODE.EXE file to the fail-safe directory on the host drive.

3. Add a line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load PROMODE.EXE and then restart the
   computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some older Diamond video adapters need the PROMODE.EXE driver for VGA support.
When you try to compress an existing drive, the computer restarts and cannot
load mini-Windows and no compression takes place. There is no support for
computers that load required drivers from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
