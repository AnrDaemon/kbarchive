TITLE   :PRB: Invalid Data Type for This Property Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under program control, the 'Invalid Data Type for This Property' error is
returned when an object is instantiated or a form is executed.

CAUSE
=====

The value entered for the property is of the wrong type. This error is likely to
occur with properties that evaluate data. For example, the CONTROLSOURCE
property specifies the source of data for a control. The control being defined
determines what type of data can be used. However, the CONTROLSOURCE property
only accepts character strings. For example,

      This.ControlSource= RECNO()  && Returns the "Invalid Data Type" error
      This.ControlSource="RECNO()" && Correct setting for this property

WORKAROUND
==========

Ensure that you are using the correct type for the expression you enter.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a partial list of properties that accept character data that
may evaluate to another type. For more information, please refer to the FoxPro
Help menu.

 - Properties of a Grid:

   RelationalExpr

 - Properties of a column:
