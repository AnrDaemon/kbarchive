SUMMARY
=======

By default, when you sign in to MSN, The Microsoft Network, your e-mail messages
are downloaded to your computer. After the messages are downloaded, they are
deleted from the MSN mail server.

You may not want to download all of your messages or you may want to leave copies
of the messages on the MSN mail server. You can use Remote Mail to see the
messages that are waiting before they are downloaded to your computer. You can
then choose to download messages, download copies of messages, or delete
messages.
