======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2b 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on from a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client computer to a LAN
Manager or Windows NT domain and your logon script (defined on the server)
executes, two windows with identical LAN Manager Logon Script title bars appear.
The window in the foreground states the following, and displays a Cancel
button:

   Please wait while your logon script executes...

If you press Enter, the logon script on the background window stops with the
following error messages:

   Batch file missing
   Bad command or file name

NOTE: The error messages above disappear very quickly. To view the error
messages, ensure that LMSCRIPT.PIF file does not have the Close Window On Exit
check box selected. The LMSCRIPT.PIF file is located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
subdirectory.

CAUSE
=====

An additional window for the logon script with a Cancel button appears in front
of the actual logon script window when:

 - WinPopup is enabled for Startup Settings in Control Panel Network.

-and-

 - Domain Logon password is saved in the user's password list (PWL) file.

The above error messages occurs when you press Enter during the execution of the
logon script in the second background window. This operation cancels the logon
script execution.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, select the window running the logon script to place
it in the foreground.

To correct this problem:

1. Reset the cached Domain Logon password by deleting the <username>.PWL
   file in the WINDOWS directory.

2. Log on to the Domain again. When the Domain Logon dialog box appears, enter
   the logon information, but do not select "Save this Password in Your Password
   List."

3. Run Control Panel, choose Network. Disable WinPopup.

   If your require WinPopup, add the following in the [windows] section of the
   WIN.INI file:

         load=winpopup.exe
