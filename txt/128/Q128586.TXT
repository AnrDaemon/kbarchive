SUMMARY
=======

Lotus-SoftSwitch has implemented SNADGET.EXE version 3.04.6 into the latest
patch version of the SNADS gateway. This patch permits the use of the gateway
mailer disable switch (-MD) in the gateway setup. This switch must be enabled
when the External Mail program is servicing the gateway postoffice. There are
two methods to enable this at the gateway:

 - Run Setup on the gateway. When you are asked "Is EXTERNAL running with the
   local postoffice (Y/N)?," answer Yes.

   The DISMAIL=Y entry is then added by Setup to the PARM.DAT file on the
   gateway. The PARM.DAT file contains the Gateway configuration information and
   is opened each time the gateway is started.

 - Edit the PARM.DAT and add the DISMAIL=Y entry. If the DISMAIL=N entry already
   exists, change N to Y. Restart the gateway for the changes to take effect.

If the SNADS gateway postoffice is not using the External Mail program to deliver
mail between other postoffices, do not use the gateway mailer disable, or mail
will not be delivered from SNADS.

Contact Lotus-Softswitch to confirm that your patch level supports the mailer
disable switch.
