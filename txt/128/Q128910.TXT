TITLE   :WFW Does Not Prompt for a Domain Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows for Workgroups you are prompted for a Domain and local
password if you have not selected the "Save this password in your password list"
check box. If your Domain password is about to expire, you are given the
opportunity to change it before it expires. If you change the Domain password,
Windows for Workgroups caches the password even though you have not selected the
"Save this password in your password list" check box.

WORKAROUND
==========

For computers running Windows for Workgroups 3.11, use ADMINCFG.EXE to disable
password caching. After doing this, you are prompted only for your Domain
password when you start Windows for Workgroups. For more information about
ADMINCFG.EXE, please refer to the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit.

As a temporary workaround you can either delete the .PWL file or use the Password
List Editor to edit the .PWL file and remove the cached Domain password. The
Password List Editor is shipped with the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit.
The problem will, however, reoccur the next time the Domain password expires.

Adding the following line to the [NETWORK] section of the System.ini file will
disable password caching and prevent your PWL file from being accessed:

   PasswordCaching=no

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
