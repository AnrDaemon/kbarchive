-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To allow a computer running Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS to be
validated by a primary domain controller (PDC) across a router:

1. Run Network Client for MS-DOS Setup and install TCP/IP.

2. Make sure that the following entries are present in the [Network] section of
   the SYSTEM.INI file located in the Network Client for MS-DOS subdirectory
   (typically C:\NET):

   lmlogon=1
   logondomain=<Your domain name>

3. Add the following to the LMHOSTS file in the Network Client for MS-DOS
   subdirectory:

   <IP address> <PDC NetBIOS name> #DOM:<Domain name>

   NOTE: The #PRE command should not be used in the LMHOSTS file for Network
   Client for MS-DOS. Any command following the #PRE command is ignored. For
   example, if you add #PRE in front of #DOM:<Domain name>, #DOM:
   <Domain name> is ignored.

Additional query words: prodnt nc msclient winnt
