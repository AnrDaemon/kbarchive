SYMPTOMS

default display properties are used.

The group boxes will become visible if you change the appearance of the active
window from the default. To change the display window's background color,
perform the following steps:

1. On the View menu, choose Window Properties.

2. Choose the Format tab.

3. Choose the Background button.

The default display properties of Exchange Forms Designer is consistent with the
functionality of Visual Basic.
