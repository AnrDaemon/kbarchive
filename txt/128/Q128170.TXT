TITLE   :PC WSPlus: MVCAL Fails If USERNAME.BAD Exists in CAL Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the file USERNAME.BAD already exists in the postoffice CAL directory,
MVCAL.EXE will fail with the following error:

   MVCAL: Cannot rename m:cal\XXXXXXXX.cal to m:cal\username.bad

For example, if you run the following command from the postoffice CAL directory
to create a 0 byte file:

      ren > username.cal

Then, you run the following command:

      MVCAL.EXE USERNAME -dM -ppassword

The above error will result.

CAUSE
=====

When MVCAL.EXE is run, it renames the postoffice copy of the calendar file from
XXXXXXXX.CAL to USERNAME.BAD; where XXXXXXXX.CAL is the user's unique
hexadecimal identification file name, and USERNAME.BAD is the user's alias
filename.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you delete or rename the USERNAME.BAD file, MVCAL.EXE will be able to rename
the file. For example from the M:\CAL directory, where M: is the postoffice
drive letter type:

   ren username.bad username.bak

Run the MVCAL command again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MVCAL.EXE is an executable file that is used to rename the postoffice copy of
the calendar file (.CAL) so that Microsoft Schedule+ can create a new calendar
file. This is useful if a calendar file becomes corrupt, or if an administrator
is trying to find the postoffice copy of the calendar file.

MVCAL.EXE is available in the Application Note WA0641 "Database Maintenance
Utilities." To obtain this Application Note, contact Microsoft Product Support
Services.
