The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use a video resolution higher than 640 x 480 x 16.7 million
(24-bit) colors, you receive the following error message:

   Your display adapter is not configured properly. To correct the problem,
   click OK to start the Hardware Installation Wizard.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 S3 video driver runs a 32-bit TrueColor mode requiring 4
megabytes (MB) of video RAM. Using the setting "Truecolor=24" in the [display]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file turns on a 24-bit mode that requires less video
RAM.

NOTE: This mode may not work correctly on all video adapters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use the "Truecolor=24" setting, use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open
the SYSTEM.INI file. Add the line "Truecolor=24" (without quotation marks) to
the [display] section of the file. Save and close the file, then shut down and
restart Windows 95.
