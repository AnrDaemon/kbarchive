TITLE   :Memory Leak on Clients with Remote Procedure Calls
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After the client side of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) creates large number of
threads, makes an RPC, and exits, a memory leak occurs. The server side of the
RPC is not affected.


CAUSE
=====

When the client side of RPC thread disappears, the thread pointer in the TLS
storage is not released.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
