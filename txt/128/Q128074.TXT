SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Interface Guidelines specify that an option available from a toolbar
should also be available on a menu. The toolbar or the menu might be associated
with different forms, and it might be necessary to have a way to access a form's
methods without explicitly naming it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ACTIVEFORM property specifies the active form in a form set or on the main
FoxPro window. It can be used to refer to a form from a menu or a toolbar.
However, to access a method of a form, you must identify and go down the
container hierarchy. A generic way to access a form would therefore include the
highest container, the main FoxPro window. The _SCREEN memory variable is a
reference to the main FoxPro window, so the following shows a generic way to
call a method of a form from a menu:

      _SCREEN.ActiveForm.callmethod()

Use the same method if the form is in a form set.
