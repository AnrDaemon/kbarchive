The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Mac OS (ALL) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log in to the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation,
the following error message may occur:

   Cannot perform any logging to designated text file for this session.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a missing ENGMAI.GLB file in the GLB subdirectory of the Mail
postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the GLB subdirectory for the existence of this file. If it does not exist,
the administrator can replace this file in one of the following two ways:

1. Find another postoffice in the Mail system that contains this file, and copy
   it from that postoffice to the problem postoffice's GLB subdirectory.

2. Using the complete set of Setup disks for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
   PC Networks, install a complete temporary postoffice on a local workstation
   hard drive. Be careful to install the complete client software (for both
   MS-DOS and Windows) as well. The temporary postoffice will contain the
   missing file in the GLB subdirectory. Copy the file to the problem
   postoffice's GLB subdirectory.
