TITLE   :PRB: Viewer Compiler Error 1661 w/ Identical Baggage Filenames
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Multimedia Viewer for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Multimedia Viewer generates multiple warning 1661 messages during the
compilation of an application. Each warning message designates a file with the
same name, but resides in a separate directory. The error message looks like
this:

   Warning 1661: Error loading baggage file:
   C:\MVPUBKIT\TURTORIAL\COYOTE.AVI (line 44 of MYTHS.MVP)

For graphic files, running the Viewer application may result in this message:

   The picture could not be displayed because it could not be found.

This message will be displayed in place of the intended image.

CAUSE
=====

The Viewer compiler strips the directory path and retains only the baggage
filename. The Viewer documentation suggests that these circumstances will
generate an

   Invalid Filename

message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the warnings, rename the baggage files.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

REFERENCES
==========

Consult the Multimedia Viewer Authoring Guide (p. 2-14) for further
documentation regarding the causes of warning 1661.
