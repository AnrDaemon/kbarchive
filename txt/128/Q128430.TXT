TITLE   :Cannot Install TCP/IP After Installing SQL Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install SQL server and then run Control Panel to install TCP/IP,
Connectivity Utilities is unavailable (grayed out), even though TCP/IP is not
installed.

CAUSE
=====

When you install SQL Server and choose to include the TCP/IP connectivity on a
computer running Windows NT without TCP/IP installed, a message is displayed
that asks you if you want to proceed. If you select Yes, false TCP/IP and
Parameter keys are created in the following registry key under the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

   \SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES

When you attempt to install TCP/IP, Windows NT finds the registry entries, and
believes that TCP/IP is already installed, and installs utilities, but not the
protocol.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete the registry keys created by SQL Server,
install TCP/IP, and then reinstall SQL Server.
