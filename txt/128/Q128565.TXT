TITLE   :LMHOSTS File Generates STOP 0x00000050
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT provides the ability to search for LMHOSTS files located on other
systems. This is permitted for file using full path on local machine or the UNC
path across networks. If you use a #INCLUDE statement with a driver letter in a
Windows NT LMHOSTS file, the following error message appears:

   STOP: 0x00000050
   PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (0x50)

For example, the following LMHOSTS file would cause the STOP message:

   #BEGIN_INCLUDE
   #INCLUDE d:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
   #END_INCLUDE


CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the text-parsing routines that causes an incorrect full
path to be generated for the local file.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version
3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
