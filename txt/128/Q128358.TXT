TITLE   :PC DB: Err Msg: Program Is Incompatible with the Postoffice
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2,3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Administration program (ADMIN.EXE) for Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, the following error may appear:

   This program is incompatible with the postoffice.

ADMIN.EXE will then fail to run, and the mail clients will not be able to access
the postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur if the MASTER.GLB is a 0 byte file or corrupt. If
ADMIN.EXE cannot find the version number stored in the MASTER.GLB on start up,
the above error will be returned.

RESOLUTION
==========

To repair, restore the MASTER.GLB from backup or create a new installation of
the postoffice using the same NETWORK/POSTOFFICE name as the original, and copy
the newly created MASTER.GLB. Ensure that the same disk set is used that
originally created this PO.

If a recent backup is not available, or you have to reinstall, you will have to
reinstall any gateways added since the date of the restored MASTER.GLB. You will
also have to enable the GAL and configure the Dir-Sync server.
