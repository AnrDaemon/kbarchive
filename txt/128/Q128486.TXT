TITLE   :BUG: Btrieve: Drop Table Does Not Remove Entry in SQLTables
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# QJET: 1267 (2.00.2114)

SYMPTOMS
========

Use of the SQL syntax Drop Table with the ODBC Btrieve Driver from the ODBC
Desktop Database Drivers version 2.0 will correctly delete the table from the
.DDF file; however, the reference to this table will still be contained when
SQLTables is called on this Btrieve database. Thus, a new table of the same name
cannot be created even though the table is no longer physically present in the
database.

For example, use ODBC Test to try to create a Btrieve table, then drop it, and
try to recreate it again. This should work.

   create table test1  (col1 string(30))
Returns: SQL_SUCCESS=0

   drop table test1
Returns: SQL_SUCCESS=0

   create table test1  (col1 string(30))
Return:   SQL_ERROR=-1
stmt:szSqlState = "S0001", *pfNativeError = -1303, *pcbErrorMsg = 62
szErrorMsg="[Microsoft][ODBC Btrieve Driver] Table 'test1' already
exists."

WORKAROUND
==========

The ODBC Btrieve driver version 2.00.2317 will resolve this problem. It must be
used in conjunction with WBTRCALL.DLL that is dated 3/31/92 and is 51,392 bytes
in size. This file must be obtained from Btrieve Technologies or Novell. Please
contact these vendors for more information on this file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft ODBC Btrieve
version 2.00.2114. This problem has been fixed in the Microsoft ODBC Btrieve
version 2.00.2317. For more information, please contact your primary support
provider.
