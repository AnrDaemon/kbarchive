======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Help file that ships with Microsoft FoxPro versions 2.6 and 2.6a states that
the function SYS(1037) is for use in FoxPro for Macintosh only. It claims that
SYS(1037) will be ignored by FoxPro for MS-DOS and FoxPro for Windows. This is
incorrect.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SYS(1037) function may be used on the Macintosh to display the Page Setup
dialog. It may also be used in FoxPro for Windows to display the Print Setup
dialog box. SYS(1037) is ignored in FoxPro for MS-DOS. The following two-step
procedure demonstrates the functionality of SYS(1037) in Windows:

1. Open Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6 or 2.6a for Windows.

2. Type "?SYS(1037)" (without the quotation marks) in the Command window, and
   press ENTER. The Windows Printer Setup dialog box appears.
