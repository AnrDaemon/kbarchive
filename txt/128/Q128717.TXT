======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear when Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS is
spawned by GWDEAMON.EXE (Netware Global Messaging's Deamon):

   Inpost: General file I/O error

CAUSE
=====

Two MS-DOS environment variables (USR and MV) need to be set on the computer
running GWDEAMON. Page 17 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS "Administrator's
Guide" details these variables as follows:

   Set USR=ADMIN
   Set MV=server/volume:
   Set MV=F:\

where F:\ is a drive letter that has been mapped to the root of the volume with
the MHS gateway installed on it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

GWDEAMON requires these variables similarly to MHS 1.5.
