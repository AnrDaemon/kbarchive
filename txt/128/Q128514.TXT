SUMMARY
=======

To place a set of objects on a form and have them equally spaced from each
other, follow these steps:

1. Using the mouse, select all the desired objects by:

    - Lassoing all the desired objects at once by clicking and holding the left
      mouse button, and then moving the mouse pointer around all the desired
      objects.

   -or-

    - Clicking each object in turn as you hold down the SHIFT key.

2. To place the selected objects vertically, choose Vertical Spacing from the
   Format menu; then select the Make Equal option. To place the selected objects
   horizontally, choose Horizontal Spacing from the Format menu; then select the
   Make Equal option.

   If, when selecting items to space vertically, you select objects from two
   columns, the Format Equal Space option will space all selected items to a new
   location, and unexpected results might occur.
