The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

ADDLABEL.APP is a FoxPro application you can use to restore all the predefined
label layouts that are included with FoxPro. In addition to this functionality
that was provided in previous versions of ADDLABEL.APP, the Visual FoxPro
version of ADDLABEL.APP provides the ability to define custom label layouts that
can later be used by the Label Designer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro for Windows ships with 86 predefined Avery label layouts. You can
use the ADDLABEL.APP application to restore these label layouts to a specific
resource file. In addition, you can use ADDLABEL.APP to create user-defined
label layouts. From the main ADDLABEL.APP screen, choose Create New Label
Layout. Then enter the characteristics (margins, label height, label width, and
so on) of a custom label layout.

All label layouts will be saved to LABELS.DBF. This includes all predefined
layouts as well as user-defined layouts. Once a custom label layout has been
created, it will be added to the resource file along with all predefined layouts
whenever ADDLABEL.APP is run.

If LABELS.DBF is damaged, Visual FoxPro must be reinstalled in order to recover
the predefined label layouts, and all custom layouts must be recreated.
