======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C Run-Time (CRT)

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to get VCFDIV.EXE, a self-extracting file that
contains a patch that fixes a problem with the fdiv function. Without the patch,
it is possible that calls to the fdiv function on Intel Pentium chips will
generate incorrect data. Please see the FDIV.TXT file included in VCFDIV.EXE for
details.

NOTE: If you have Visual C++ version 2.1, you don't need this patch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

VCFDIV.EXE upgrades the compiler, and the C-RunTime libraries for both Win32 and
Win32s, to the versions that were distributed with Visual C++ version 2.1.
