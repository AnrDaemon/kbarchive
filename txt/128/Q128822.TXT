======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change modem-specific settings in the Modem Properties dialog box in
Microsoft Fax, the fax transport does not use the new settings. For example, the
fax transport does not use a new Speaker Volume or Answer After <n> Rings
setting.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs only with certain fax/modems. A list of these fax/modems is
not currently available.


RESOLUTION
==========

To make sure the new settings are used, restart the application that will use
them. For example, restart Microsoft Exchange after you change modem-specific
settings in Microsoft Fax.

1. Double-click the Microsoft Fax Status icon on the taskbar.
