KEYWORDS:kbenv kbvfp300

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro writes information about interoperability issues (such as DDE and
OLE) and FoxPro settings to the registry (under Windows 95 or Windows NT) or to
REG.DAT (under Windows or Windows for Workgroups).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information is stored in the registry. Run REGEDIT/V to view the
data.

 - The name and location of the Visual FoxPro executable (.EXE) file.

 - If you have the Pro version of Visual FoxPro, the name and location of the
   .ESL file.

 - Associations with the Visual FoxPro .EXE file. Visual FoxPro is loaded when
   you double-click a file with the following extensions: APP, FXP, PRG.

 - FoxPro is registered as an Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) client.

 - Options and preferences exposed in the Options dialog. The Options dialog
   provides a way to centralize FoxPro settings such as system memory variables,
   various SET commands, information about remote data, and registered classes.
   These are called user settings. When Visual FoxPro is first installed, the
   system memory variables are written to the registry, but there are no other
   user settings in the registry or REG.DAT. The settings are written in the
   registry or REG.DAT the first time you access the Options dialog and click
   the Save as Default button.

For more information about the Options dialog, please refer to Chapter 3,
Configuring FoxPro, in the Installation Guide.
