TITLE   :Cannot Remote Control Windows IPX/NetBIOS Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to initiate a remote control session with the client, a Quick
Window appears and it looks like it is trying to connect. It closes itself. No
error message appears.

CAUSE
=====

This only occurs if Windows for Workgroups is configured to use both the NetWare
shell and the NWLINK protocol stack. In that case, NWLINK grabs the IPX packets,
but does not pass them on to WUSER.

RESOLUTION
==========

Network Setup installs NWLINK by default, so you must manually remove it to make
WUSER work.

NOTE: Loading support for "Netware Shell Versions 4.0 and Above" and the
Microsoft Network with either NetBEUI or TCP/IP32 works correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this is a problem in Microsoft Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
