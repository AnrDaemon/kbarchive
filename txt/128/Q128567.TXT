OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a page in landscape orientation with a PostScript driver under
Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51, the text is in the opposite corner of where the
landscape text is when printing with a Windows NT PCL driver. This is not
consistent with the Windows 95, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, or the Windows
NT 3.1 PostScript drivers.

==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.
