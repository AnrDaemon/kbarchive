SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
includes a registry parameter for replication partners called PersonaNonGrata
(located under the \Wins\Partners key).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This parameter is not defined in the Windows NT 3.5 registry help file or in the
Windows NT 3.5 Server documentation. It is documented only in the Microsoft
Windows NT Resource Kit Volume 2: Windows NT Networking Guide (Chapter 14, Page
306, Installing and Configuring WINS Servers).

This parameter specifies the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of WINS servers
whose records are not to be inserted into the local database during replication.
If there are incorrect records in one or more WINS server databases on your
network, you can prevent those records from being replicated to your WINS Server
database by specifying the IP addresses of the WINS servers that own them under
the PersonaNonGrata parameter. After you make this change, restart the server
for the change to take effect.

Additional query words: prodnt
