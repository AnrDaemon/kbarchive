TITLE   :VGA Cards Not Operational on Secondary PCI Slots
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some computers such as the Intergraph TD Workstation series allow VGA video
cards to be used in any of the secondary PCI slots. This configuration does not
work in Windows NT version 3.5.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the I/O port allocation assigns an address to a primary
PCI device which conflicts with the 10 bit decoding performed by a PCI bridge
chip for the PCI VGA card plugged into a secondary slot.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.

Additional query words: prodnt adapter
