TITLE   :PRB: Grid Does Not Respond to the Click or Dblclick Events
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The methods associated with the Click or DblClick events of a grid are not
executed when a user clicks any element of the Grid. It seems events are not
triggered when the grid is filled with data.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. A grid object is a container of columns. Columns in
turn contain controls. Methods defined in a container are not inherited in the
container hierarchy. For example, the code you include in the Click event of a
form is not executed when you click a command button.

When a grid is filled with data and you click a cell in the grid, the control, a
text box by default, receives the Click event. The grid receives the click event
in areas that contain no data.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Click event procedure of the control to trap for a mouse click in a
filled record.

Another way to trap for a mouse click anywhere on the grid is to cover the grid
with a shape, and place code in the Click event of the shape. Make sure the
Backstyle property of the shape is set to 0 for transparent and that the shape
is on top. If the shape is not on top of the grid, you can place it there by
selecting "Bring to Front" on the layout toolbar when the shape is selected.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. When the form is displayed, choose Data Environment from the View menu.

3. When the Data Environment window is displayed, click the right mouse button
   and select Add. Add the CUSTOMER table from the SAMPLES\DATA directory.

4. Drag the table from the Data Environment to the Form. A grid is created.

5. In the property sheet, select the Grid1 object, and modify the value of the
   Columncount property from -1 to 2.

6. Double-click the Click Event entry in the Property Sheet to open the code
   window. Type the following code and close the code window:

      WAIT WINDOW "This is the Grid"

7. In the Property sheet, select the Text1 Object.

8. Open the code window for the Click event of Text1, and enter this code:

      WAIT WINDOW "This is the Text control"

9. Save the form, and run it.

When the form is displayed, click several areas of the grid. The parts with data
in the first column will display "This is the Text control"; the areas of the
grid with no data will display a WAIT WINDOW with "This is the Grid."
