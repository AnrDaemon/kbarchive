TITLE   :SMTP: -MR Option Ignored When You Use It with -MD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use both the -MD and -MR options when you run the Microsoft Mail Gateway
to SMTP, the -MR option does not work. Messages come into the gateway; however,
the receive log is not updated to reflect the incoming messages.

CAUSE
=====

The receive log is written when the gateway delivers the message to the correct
mailbag. If you use the -MD option but the mailer portion is not working, the
message is never delivered to the receiver's mailbag and the log file is never
written to.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you run the SMTP gateway, do not use the -MD and -MR command-line options
at the same time.

Use the -MR option on the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) so that when the
External Mail program delivers messages, it will then record information to the
receive log file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The -MR option turns on the receive logging function of the gateway: any message
that comes into the gateway and is passed to the gateway postoffice will be
logged into the receive log file (MAILDATA\LOG\RECV.LOG) on the gateway
postoffice.

The -MD option disables the mailer portion of SMTPPUT.EXE: all incoming messages
will be put into INQUEUE3.MBG and left there for the External Mail program to
process. It is the External Mail program's responsibility to deliver the mail to
the correct mailbag.
