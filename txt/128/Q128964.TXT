 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you modify the Microsoft Mail for Windows user's mailbox, the modifications
will force Microsoft Schedule+ to create new calendar files (.CAL) because of
the login IDs have been changed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you log into Schedule+, the \MAILDATA\CAL\SCHEDULE.KEY is accessed to
determine if the user's login ID (mailbox) already has an existing hexid number
assigned to it. Because the login ID is different, a new HEXID.CAL will be
created along with a new USERNAME.CAL on the local workstation.


To retrieve the information from the user's original calendar file, do the
following steps:

1. Add StartupOffline=1 to the SCHDPLUS.INI file.

2. Launch Schedule+ using the old username and password.

   This should bring the information from the users original USERNAME.CAL file on
   the local workstation.

3. From the File menu, choose Export Appointments.

   You should export the appointments to the USERNAME.SCH file.

4. Log out of Schedule+.

5. Remove the StartupOffline=1 parameter from the SCHDPLUS.INI file.

6. Launch Schedule+ using the new username and password.

   This should bring up the blank calendar file information.

7. From the File menu, choose Import Appointments. You should import the
   appointments from the USERNAME.SCH file created in step 3.
