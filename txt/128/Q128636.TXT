SUMMARY
=======

You can set up Visual SourceSafe for replication under Windows NT to allow a
database to be mirrored on a backup server, and thus increase network
reliability. This article explains how to do it for SourceSafe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Follow the directions for setting up a replication directory as presented in
   the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q101602 Configuring Windows NT for Replication

2. Set up the permissions for SourceSafe, which can be a bit tricky. There are
   two sets of permissions that must be reviewed: Share permissions and
   Directory permissions. The directory permissions override the settings of the
   share permissions. Because of this, setting up a share in this directory is a
   two-step process; you must set both sets of permissions. After setting up the
   share in the normal fashion, the NT administrator must also change the
   Security..Permissions to include SS users.
