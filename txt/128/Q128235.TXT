When you use Windows NT Resource Kit Command Scheduler on a MIPS machine,
the graphical user interface stops responding (hangs) when you schedule
three jobs.

To recover from this situation, use the task list to close the Command
Scheduler and then use the AT command to delete one of the jobs.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Resource Kit
Command Scheduler for MIPS. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
