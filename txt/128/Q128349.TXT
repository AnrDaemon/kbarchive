OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add more than 64 MB of physical memory (RAM) to a Hewlett-Packard (HP)
Vectra XU P5/90 or XU P5/90C computer, Windows NT does not detect the additional
RAM beyond 64 MB. The computer power on self test (POST) detects the correct
amount of memory.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the BIOS version on your computer is earlier than version
GO.05.08.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade the BIOS on the HP Vectra XU P5/90 computer to
version GO.05.08 or later. The BIOS upgrade is available for download from the
HP bulletin board service (BBS) at (208) 344-1691. Download GO0508US.EXE.
