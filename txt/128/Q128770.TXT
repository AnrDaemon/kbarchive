TITLE   :PRB: "Insufficient Memory" Previewing A Report In FPM
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:2.60a 3.00b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error messages may be received when previewing a report:

   Insufficient Memory

   -or-

   Internal Consistency Error

   -or-

   Error #43 in process (O): there is not enough memory to complete this
   operation."

CAUSE
=====

On the Macintosh, there is a 'Setting of selected monitor' in the Monitors
Control Panel. If this setting is set to 'Millions' or 'Thousands' of colors
this may cause FoxPro to report 'INSUFFICIENT MEMORY' when previewing a report.
This has also been reported to cause Internal Consistency Errors (ICE) errors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this from occurring, change the setting under 'Control
Panel/Monitors' to 256 or 16 (recommended).

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
