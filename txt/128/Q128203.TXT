SYMPTOMS

must use the Generic/Text Only printer driver. However, Microsoft Windows NT
does not ship with the Generic/Text Only printer driver or any equivalent
drivers.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create a hard-coded report using the ??? "" command to put the printer driver in
'raw' mode and use @..SAY or ? statements to output the data to the file.


STATUS

the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
