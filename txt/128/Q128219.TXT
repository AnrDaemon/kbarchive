TITLE   :PC Win: Importing PROFS Nicknames Displays Incorrect Templates
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If more than one nickname is present for a PROFS user, the user's details from
the global address list (GAL) in Microsoft Mail for Windows may display
incorrect information. If you check the PROFS gateway list or the external
postoffice list in the Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE), the details are
displayed correctly. Also, if you check the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks,
MS-DOS workstation, the details are displayed correctly from the network list,
the PROFS list, and the GAL. The problem only occurs with the Windows client.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs after you import a PROFS text file containing multiple
nicknames pointing to the same userid. For example, a nickname would be an
individual employee, and the userid would be an assistant. This import file
contains "A" type of records pointing to one 10/10/10 address, and all of these
contain the same mailbox name.

After you run Rebuild to build the GAL, launch the Windows client. Select a
nickname from the GAL in the Windows client, and get details. The alias
information is correct, but the userid of another user in the import text file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2a of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.4083. If
you do not have version 3.2.4083 (or later), you can find MSSFS.EXE, a
