KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a Compaq Presario CDS633 and you select the High Color (16-
bit) or True Color (24-bit) color palette in the property sheet for the display,
the system falls back to Standard VGA and prompts you to choose another display
setting. The 16-bit and 24-bit color palettes are still shown as available but
you cannot implement them.

CAUSE
=====

Although Windows 95 correctly detects the Tseng ET4000/W32 chip set in the
built-in display circuitry of the CDS633, the video BIOS in this system does not
provide support for these display modes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Choose the 16 Color or 256 Color color palette. You may want to contact Compaq
for information about a possible video BIOS upgrade, or install a display
adapter that fully supports the display mode you want to use.

MORE INFORMATION
================

High Color is a 16-bit display mode that supports a 65,536-color palette. True
Color is a 24-bit display mode that supports up to 16.7 million colors.
