The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1995 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you create the Daily Directory, if the path location to the BS95_DLY
subdirectory exceeds 41 characters, the path location will be truncated during a
download. For example, if Baseball is installed in a tiered directory, such as
the following

   C:\PROGRAMS\WINDOWS3\MM_MEDIA\BASEBALL\DOWNLOAD\BASE95\MA95_DLY

the dialog after the first download will display the file path as:

   C:\....MEDIA\BASEBALL\DOWNLOAD\BASEB95\MS95_DLY

MORE INFORMATION
================

The path will only display the first 41 characters and then append and
substitute an ellipse (...) to indicate that the path is too long to be
displayed.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Baseball 1995. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
