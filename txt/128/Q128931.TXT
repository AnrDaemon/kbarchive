The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

The NCR 53C810 PCI SCSI host adapter is built-in on most Dell computers and it
supports SCSI-tagged command queuing. The SCSI-tagged command queuing allows a
SCSI host adapter to send multiple SCSI commands to a device before receiving a
response for any of the commands. If this feature is disabled (the Windows NT
default), the SCSI host adapter must wait for a command response before sending
another. In some environments, enabling SCSI-tagged command queuing results in
improved system performance.
