TITLE   :PRB: Function Requires Row or Table Buffering Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing a command or function that requires buffering, without enabling
buffering first, causes the following error to occur:

   Error number 1586 "Function requires row or table buffering mode"

CAUSE
=====

A command or function, such as TABLEUPDATE() or TABLEREVERT(), that requires
buffering to be enabled has been issued.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable buffering to resolve this problem. The on error routine listed below can
be used to set the default buffering mode programatically if this error occurs:

      ON ERROR DO errhandler
    
      PROCEDURE errhandler
    
         =aerror(aLastError)
         DO CASE
            CASE aLastError(1) = 1586
               SET MULTILOCKS ON
               =Cursorsetprop("Buffering",5)
               RETRY
         ENDCASE

MORE INFORMATION
================

An on error routine can handle a variety of errors that may occur during
processing. Include an OTHERWISE section within the DO CASE construct to handle
errors that are not specifically included in the on error routine.
