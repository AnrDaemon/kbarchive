The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some windows attributes related to a form. The tasks
described in this article are available as commands in Microsoft FoxPro versions
2.x for Windows and for MS-DOS. As the association between the functionality and
the properties might not be readily apparent, this article describes how the
BorderStyle, WindowState, and WindowType properties relate to sizing,
minimizing, or defining a READ form window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sizing a Window
---------------

It is possible to control whether or not a form window can be resized. The
sizable attribute can be controlled with the BorderStyle property. To conform to
Windows interface guidelines, all System windows can be sized. Furthermore,
because only System windows can be resized, the style of the border defined for
the window determines whether or not the window can be sized. When the
BorderStyle property has a value of 3 (System), the Form window can be sized by
dragging the lower right hand corner or by pressing CTRL+F8.


Minimizing a Window
-------------------

By using the MinButton and MaxButton properties, you can control whether a user
can click the Minimize or Maximize buttons. You can use the WINDOWSTATE property
to minimize or maximize a form window. For example, the following command
minimizes a form called oFrmtest:

      oFrmtest.WindowState = 1

Using a READ Window
-------------------

Two values (2-READ and 3-READ MODAL) of the WindowType property, define a READ
form window where program execution stops at the Show method or the DO FORM
command. These values are only available in a form set, and one of the forms in
the form set has to contain a Page Frame. As this feature is implemented for
backwards compatibility, it is preferable to use the new event model with your
Microsoft Visual FoxPro forms.

For more information about the BorderStyle, WindowState, and WindowType
properties, please search in the online FoxPro Help menu using the words
