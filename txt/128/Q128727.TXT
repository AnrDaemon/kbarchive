SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you how, by using the ADD CLASS command, you can make a copy
of an existing class without subclassing from the parent class.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax for the ADD CLASS command is:

   ADD CLASS <ClassName> OF <ClassLibrary1> To <ClassLibrary2>

<ClassName> is the name of the class definition added to the .VCX visual
class library <Class Library2>.

<ClassLibrary1> Specifies a .VCX visual class library from which the class
definition is copied.

<ClassLibrary2> Specifies the .VCX visual class library to which the class
definition is added.

If you omit the optional <OF ClassLibrary1> clause, Visual FoxPro searches
for the class definition in any .VCX visual class libraries opened with SET
CLASSLIB. Visual FoxPro generates an error if the class definition cannot be
located or a class definition with the name you specify already exists in
ClassLibrary2.

NOTE: The .VCX visual class library <ClassLibrary2> that you are adding to
must exist. ADD CLASS will not create it if is does not exist.
