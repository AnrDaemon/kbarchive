TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Access MAPI Under Win32s
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MAPI custom controls do not do anything with Visual FoxPro running under Win32s.
In addition, no error messages occur when you use the MAPI custom controls.

CAUSE
=====

Due to a missing thunking layer between 32-bit applications and the 16-bit MAPI
DLLs, FoxPro, which is a 32-bit application, cannot communicate with the MAPI
OLE custom controls under Win32s.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you would like to use the MAPI custom controls, you must upgrade to Microsoft
Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 95.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As an alternative to using MAPI Controls, you can use Foxtools.fll and MAPI
calls to accomplish your mail sending needs. For more information about how to
do this, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q102467 Using MAPI.DLL to Invoke MS Mail from FoxPro for Windows

Also, the Send option on the File menu should work for sending mail messages
through MS Mail under WIN32s.
