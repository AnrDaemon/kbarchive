TITLE   :Correct Wallpaper Not Displayed on Remote Workstation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95 4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a workstation other than your own, the correct wall- paper is
not displayed even though User Profiles is enabled.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - The wallpaper specified in your user profile does not exist on the
   workstation you have logged on to.

 - The wallpaper specified in your user profile exists on the workstation you
   have logged on to, but it is not located in the same directory as it is on
   your local workstation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, place a copy of the wallpaper file that you want
to use on the workstation you are logging on to. You must place the wallpaper
file in the same directory as it is on your local workstation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The registry entry that contains the wallpaper setting for your user profile
stores the entire path for the wallpaper file. If the wallpaper file does not
exist in the path specified for your user profile, Windows 95 cannot find or
display the wallpaper.
