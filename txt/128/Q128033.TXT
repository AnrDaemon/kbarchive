TITLE   :Unable to Read Text with a 16-color Video Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a 16-color video display driver is installed for the Microsoft Windows
environment and you run the Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright, the start up portion
appears as expected. The display clarity does not significantly change until you
are in the Contents screen and select an option. Once an option is selected,
text becomes extremely difficult to read.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the video display driver to a full 256-color (or better) display. For
more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Frank Lloyd Wright version 1.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
