TITLE   :Security Log Close Handles Don't Match Open Handles
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

About half the close audit entries in the security log display the same constant
value for handle identification numbers (IDs), even though those handle IDs are
supposed to match the open audit routine handle IDs which vary.

NOTE: You can still follow the audit trail in the Security log and find a
corresponding open audit entry for each close audit entry, but the handle IDs in
the close audit entries will be wrong.

CAUSE
=====

The service controller handle ID passing routine does not always correctly pass
along the handle IDs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
