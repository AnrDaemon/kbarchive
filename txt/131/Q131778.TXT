TITLE   :System-wide Pool Paged Bytes Allocated By Files Are Not Released
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you close files in Windows NT 3.5, the file handles are released, but the
pool paged bytes allocated for the files are not released by the Cache Manager.
Because Windows NT Cache Manager allocates 100 megabytes of system-wide pool
paged memory for every 100 gigabytes of files accessed on the computer
(including file accessed multiple times), the maximum number of bytes can be
used quickly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
