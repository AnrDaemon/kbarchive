======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE), when you modify a Requestor to be the
Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) Server under Config, DirSync, Options, Yes,
the following error may occur:

   Notice 162 - Failed to complete installation of the directory server.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if the MASTER.GLB file is locked open or flagged as read-
only. The Admin program tries to modify the Dir-Sync server field in MASTER.GLB
to yes(1) and is not successful.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that this file is not flagged as read-only. Also, check if the file is
locked open by another user.

One way to check if a file is locked open is to try and rename it. If successful,
then the file is not locked, and it is safe to rename it back to its original
filename.
