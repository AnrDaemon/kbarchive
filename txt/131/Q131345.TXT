-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The DISPLAY OBJECTS command's behavior is similar to that of the DISPLAY MEMORY
command. However, DISPLAY OBJECTS reports information about objects instead of
memory variables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DISPLAY OBJECTS displays the following information about all existing objects:

 - Properties and their values

 - Methods

 - Member objects and the class or subclass on which they are based

 - Class or subclass on which objects are based

 - Class hierarchy for the objects

You can also use the DISPLAY OBJECTS [LIKE][NOCONSOLE][TO PRINT][TO FILE] clauses
as you can with all the DISPLAY commands.

Example
-------

The following code creates the object oCustom based on the custom class and
directs the output of the DISPLAY OBJECT command to the file TEST.TXT.

      oCustom=Createobject("CUSTOM")
      DISPLAY OBJECT LIKE oCustom TO FILE TEST.TXT
