TITLE   :XADM: EDBUTIL /d <Path to Dir.edb> Causes NT 2140 Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Edbutil /d <path to Dir.edb> is run from the Exchsrvr\Bin directory,
the following errors will occur:

 - In some cases, such as RC2 to RTM upgrade, a dialogue box will appear before
   Edbutil finishes saying that Chkdsk needs to be run and that the
   Exchsrvr\Dsadata directory is damaged and corrupt. After this dialogue is
   cleared, Edbutil will finish successfully.

 - When the Microsoft Exchange Directory Service is restarted from Control Panel
   Services, the following error message will be displayed:

   Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Directory Service on server
   \\<server name>. Error 2140: An Internal Windows NT error occurred.

WORKAROUND
==========

Edbutil will create an Edb.chk, Edb.log, Res1.log and Res2.log in the directory
in which it is run. When the Directory Service starts up, it is looking for
these newly created files and cannot find them in it's working directory
(Exchsrvr\Dsadata). There are two workarounds for this problem:

 - Run Edbutil in the Dsadata directory as follows:

   C:\Exchsrvr\Dsadata>C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\Edbutil /d
   C:\Exchsrvr\Dsadata\Dir.edb

   Where C: should be replaced with the appropriate installation drive letter.
   This will cause the .log files and Edb.chk file to be created in the
   Exchsrvr\Dsadata directory.

 - Move the Edb.chk, Edb.log, Res1.log, and Res2.log files from the directory
   where Edbutil was run, into the Exchsrvr\Dsadata directory.

After performing either of the above steps, restart the Directory Service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange Server. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
