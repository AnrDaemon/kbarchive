The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you connect to a Windows NT server and try to access a file that has a long
file name, Windows version 3.x uses the PC-NFS standards to truncate the name of
the file to eight characters placing tilde (~) in the seventh position followed
by a number.

Developers can use the generic code listed in this article to make sure no long
file names exist on the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The following code returns TRUE (.T.) if no long file names exist on the
default directory. Otherwise, it returns FALSE (.F.).

       SET DEFAULT TO <NET DRIVE>:<PATH>
      X=CREATEOBJECT("CustTrackLongName")
      Do While (X.FINDLONG())
        .
        .
      <REST OF CODE TO MODIFY FILES>
        .
        .
      ENDDO

      *********************************************
      *   This is a class that will track         *
      *   any long file name  in the default      *
      *   directory.                            *
      *   The class define is a property that is  *
      *   set to true if no long file names       *
      *   exist and false if a long file name     *
      *   does exist. In addition, the class      *
      *   defines a member(method) called         *
      *   FindLong that will check to see         *
      *   if a long filename was returned by the  *
      *   ADIR function.                        *
      *                                           *
      * Algorithm:                                *
      *      Input/Parameters:    NONE            *
      *      Output/Return Value: .T. No LFN      *
