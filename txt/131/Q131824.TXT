SUMMARY
=======

When you monitor the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA) as
a Service, it is possible to press the ESC key then the Y key to exit while an
instance of External or Dispatch is running. If you view the instance from the
Control Panel Services, it indicates the External or Dispatch program is still
running (started).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Monitor window has the same functionality as any External session. As a
result, if you press ESC and Y, it will stop mail from being delivered. However,
the service that starts External will show that the process is started. To stop
an instance of External run Control Panel Services, and choose stop. This will
stop the service and the External process.
