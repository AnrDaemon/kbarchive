The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure SNA Server to talk to a remote IBM
AS/400 computer , connected as follows:

  SNA Server <--->  AS/400  <- (appn) ->  AS/400
  (SNASERV)        (AS400A)              (AS400B)

For users to connect to AS400B through SNA Server, SNA Server should be
configured with two Remote APPC LU's (AS400A and AS400B) off a single 802.2
connection to AS400A. Users can then open sessions to AS400B by requesting the
AS400B remote LU name.

For additional information and configuration examples showing how SNA Server can
be configured to communicate with an AS/400, please see the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q112158 Configuring SNA Server to Talk to AS/400 Over 802.2

   Q112159 Configuring SNA Server to Talk to AS/400 Over SDLC

NOTE: SNA Server should only be configured with a single 802.2 connection to an
AS/400. SNA Server dual connections to the same AS/400 will not work, since the
AS/400 only supports a single APPC controller definition per control point, and
SNA Server (acting as a LEN node) can only be configured with a single local
control point name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some network configurations, it may not be practical for SNA Server to have a
direct SNA link to an AS/400. In cases where a remote AS/400 is accessible
through a locally accessible AS/400 acting as an APPN network node, SNA Server
can be configured to access the remote AS/400.

Referring to the diagram above, here is how SNA Server could be configured to
support user access to both AS/400's. Using an 802.2 connection as an example:

   Server Properties
     Local network name        = APPN
     Local control point name  = SNASERV

   Local APPC LU Properties: SNASERV
     LU 6.2 type = Independent
     LU alias            = SNASERV
     network name        = APPN
     LU name             = SNASERV

   Connection Properties:  TOKEN1
     Remote end = peer system
     Remote network address    = < address of AS400A >
     Remote network name       = APPN
     Remote control point name = AS400A

   Remote APPC LU Properties: AS400A   (used to access AS400A)
     LU alias            = AS400A
     network name        = APPN
     LU name             = AS400A
     Supports parallel sessions

     Partners:
     Partner LU = SNASERV, Mode = QPCSUPP, Connection: TOKEN1

   Remote APPC LU Properties: AS400B   (used to access AS400B)
     LU alias            = AS400B
     network name        = APPN
     LU name             = AS400B
     Supports parallel sessions

     Partners:
     Partner LU = SNASERV, Mode = QPCSUPP, Connection: TOKEN1

To open a session to AS400B, the SNA Server user should request Local LU alias of
SNASERV, and a remote LU alias of AS400B.
