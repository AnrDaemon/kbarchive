TITLE   :PC DirSync: After Reset, Export/Import Times Still Exist
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Administrators can reset the Reqconf.glb file using Listds.exe. This utility
provides part of the process a mail administrators uses to reset a Dir-Sync
requester for versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

After Listds.exe is used to reset a Dir-Sync requester, the times for the last
Dir-Sync Export and Dir-Sync Import still exist. This article explains why.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An administrator may view the Dir-Sync last Export and Import times by running
the ADMIN.EXE program and selecting Config, DirSync, Requester, Import (or
Export).

NOTE: The Import option is not available for a Dir-Sync Server.

When one of these options is selected, and an Export or Import has been done
previously, the program will provide the following information:

Import
------

   Last Import request processed on DATE at TIME. Continue?

Export
------

   Last Export request processed on DATE at TIME. Continue?

This last Import/Export information is stored in the REQCONF.GLB file. However,
the Listds.exe utility does not reset that particular portion of this file.
Therefore, even though the Listds.exe "resets" the Reqconf.glb by successfully
resetting the REQSYNC and SRVSYNC values, the last Import/Export times will
remain. This is normal and expected behavior.

Resetting the last Import or Export times is not required to successfully reset a
DirSync requester.

The Listds.exe utility is included in the "Directory Synchronization (Dir- Sync)"
document. You can obtain this document from the following sources:
