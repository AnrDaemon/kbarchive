PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience problems configuring static routing tables in Windows NT and
TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups when using the following ROUTE.EXE
commands:

   ROUTE -F      (clears routing tables for all gateway entries)
   ROUTE ADD     (adds a route to the routing tables)

ROUTE -F
--------

On a multihomed computer, the default gateway IP addresses of 0.0.0.0 for all
network interface cards (NICs) are lost when you use the ROUTE -F command.

If you add the default gateway using the ROUTE ADD command, the default gateway
route for only the first NIC is applied. The default gateway routes of 0.0.0.0
for other NICs are lost.

ROUTE ADD
---------

If you use the ROUTE ADD command and add an incorrect entry, the entry is not
added to the route table. No message is displayed indicating that the entry is
incorrect and has not been added.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The correct format for the ROUTE ADD command is:

   route add <subnet address> MASK <subnet mask> <address to
   add>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5,
and 3.51 and in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
