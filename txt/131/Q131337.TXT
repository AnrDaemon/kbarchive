TITLE   :STOP Msg: 0x0000007B w/ Quantum Empire Drive and Adaptec 2940
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Installation of Windows NT 3.5 on a Quantum Empire hard drive connected to an
Adaptec controller fails with the following STOP Message:

   STOP 0x0000007B
   INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE

CAUSE
=====

The STOP Message occurs because the Adaptec controller is configured for a
maximum synchronous transfer rate (Max Sync Xfer Rate) of 10 MB (megabytes) per
second. According to Quantum technical support, the error is due to the clock on
the Adaptec controller that allows the adapter to negotiate a Max Sync Xfer Rate
of 10.6 MB/sec. The digital filter on the hard drive returns an error to the
operating system because it is set for a Max Sync Xfer Rate of 10.2 MB/sec.


WORKAROUND
==========

There is updated firmware for the Quantum Empire drive which fools the SCSI
controller into a connection of 8 MB/sec. when it is set for 10 MB/sec. The
firmware upgrade may be obtained from Quantum by calling their technical support
line at (800) 826-8022.

You can also work around this problem by setting the Max Sync Xfer Rate on the
Adaptec controller at or below 8 MB/sec. or setting Initiate Sync Negotiation to
"No."
