======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are working with an image in Windows 95 Paint, the following problems
may occur when you invoke Help:

 - When you are editing text with the Text tool, the text disappears when you
   start Help and does not reappear when you close Help.

 - If part of the image is selected with the Select or Free Form Select tool, it
   is no longer selected after you start Help.

 - If you are editing an image with the Curve or Polygon tool, it disappears
   after you start Help.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Save the file before you start Help so that you can reopen the intact file
   after you close Help.

 - Click elsewhere in the Paint workspace to set the image, or click another
   control on the toolbar, before you start Help.

Note that these workarounds work for disappearing text or images. There is no
workaround to keep part of the image selected with the Select or Free Form
Select tool when you start Help. You must select the area again after you close
Help.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
