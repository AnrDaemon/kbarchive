SUMMARY
=======

The online documentation for Microsoft Visual C++ versions 2.0 and 2.1 has
entries for the member function CDC::GetWindow(). However, an attempt to use
this function results in an unresolved external error.

The documentation is in error. The function was not implemented in versions 2.0
or 2.1. This function has been implemented in Visual C++ version 2.2.

NOTE: You can obtain the same functionality using the Windows API function
::WindowFromDC. For example:

CWnd *pWnd = CWnd::FromHandle(::WindowFromDC(pDC->m_hDC);

NOTE: This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0 and later.

Additional query words: 2.00 3.00 2.10 3.10 4.00
