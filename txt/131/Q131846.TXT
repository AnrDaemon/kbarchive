TITLE   :BUG: Deleted Rows Show w/ 'Show Deleted Rows' Option Cleared
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# QJet: 2262 (2.00.2317)

SYMPTOMS
========

The Paradox, dBase, and FoxPro drivers will show the deleted rows even when the
Show Deleted Rows option in the ODBC Setup dialog box is cleared.

NOTE: The Microsoft Access driver does not exhibit this behavior.

In the datasource setup, the default for Show Deleted Rows option is off.
However, all the above drivers will still show the deleted records on a SELECT
statement. It appears that the ODBCDDP.INI setting Deleted=Off has no effect
initially.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs only if you had never selected and cleared the Show Deleted
check box.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select and clear the Show Deleted Rows check box in the ODBC Setup dialog box to
resolve the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the 16-bit and 32-bit ODBC
version 2.0 Paradox, FoxPro, and dBase drivers. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
