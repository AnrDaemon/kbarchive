SUMMARY
=======

If you install Encarta 1995 on a hard drive that does not contain the active
system folder (non-startup drive), the installation may not install all the
files to the appropriate locations.

The problem is most noticeable on machines running System 7.0 or System 7.0.1
system software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On System 7.0 and 7.0.1, installing Encarta to a drive without the active system
folder doesn't properly install some necessary fonts. In some cases, the install
program may not install Encarta at all to such a drive.

To resolve these problems, install Encarta to your start-up hard drive. If you
want Encarta on another hard drive, drag the Encarta folder to that drive when
the install process is complete.

For more information about this issue, see section six of the Encarta ReadMe
file.
