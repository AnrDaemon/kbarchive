TITLE   :Windows 95 Hangs at Boot with 386Max and More Than 16 MB RAM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may stop responding (hang) when you start it on a computer with more
than 16 megabytes (MB) of memory.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if 386Max, a memory manager published by Qualitas, Inc.,
is installed on the computer. The way this memory manager handles more than 16
MB of memory is incompatible with Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, remove 386Max and use the Microsoft XMS memory
manager (HIMEM.SYS) instead. To do so, use any text editor to edit the
CONFIG.SYS file. Remove or remark out any reference to 386MAX and then add the
following line as the first line in the file:

   device=c:\windows\himem.sys

Save and then close the CONFIG.SYS file, and then restart your computer.

For additional information about removing 386Max, please refer to that program's
documentation or manufacturer.
