SUMMARY
=======

By setting Compare to Time, you can increase the speed of the Get command. This
may, however, provide unexpected results unless you are aware of the way
SourceSafe compares the time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SourceSafe compares the time with the Modification time of the file. Because of
this, Compare = Time will only work correctly if SetTime = Mod.

For instance, if SetTime = Current (the default), the local file will have the
date of when the GET command was executed. Reissuing the GET will always cause
SourceSafe to determine the files do not match. Similar behavior will occur if
SetTime = Update.

When using Compare = Time, the best behavior will occur with SetTime = Mod.
However, for more reliable results, set Compare to Full or Checksum.

For more information on how to improve the performance of a Get command by using
the Compare to Checksum setting, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base.
