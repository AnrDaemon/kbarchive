When you press the ALT+ENTER key combination in an MS-DOS prompt session, your
computer may stop responding (hang). You must restart your computer to make the
keyboard work again.

 - Replace the AnyKey keyboard with a model not dated 6/18/91. For example,
   AnyKey keyboards dated 3/9/92 and later have been found to work correctly.

 - Replace the AnyKey keyboard with a keyboard from a different manufacturer.

 - Do not press ALT+ENTER to switch between a windowed and full-screen MS-DOS
   prompt session.
