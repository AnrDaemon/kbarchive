The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to set the BackColor of an object to the
current button-face color. You can use this in a program to change the BackColor
of the form or form page color to match that of the button face or 3D color.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example Using Code
-------------------------------

The following program displays a form that contains one command button (Button1).
The code in the Click procedure sets the BackColor of the form to the current
BackColor of the button face.

1. From the File menu, choose New. Select the Program option, and choose the New
   File button to bring up the Modify Program window.

2. Enter the following code:

      oMyForm = CREATEOBJECT("MyForm")
      oMyForm.show
      READ EVENTS

      DEFINE CLASS MyForm AS FORM

         ADD OBJECT Button1 AS COMMANDBUTTON WITH ;
            caption="QUIT"

         PROCEDURE Click
            Local cColor cRGB
            m.cRGB = RGBSCHEME(1,2)
            m.cColor = 'RGB(' + SUBSTR(m.cRGB, AT(',', m.cRGB, 3) +1)
            This.BackColor = EVAL(cColor)
         ENDPROC

         PROCEDURE button1.Click
            CLEAR EVENTS
         ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE

3. Save the Program, and run it. When the form displays, click an area of the
   form to see the BackColor of the form change to the BackColor of the button.

Step-by-Step Example Using the Form Designer
--------------------------------------------

To add this functionality to a Form by using the Visual FoxPro Form Designer,
follow these steps:

1. Add a command button to the form by using the Form Control Toolbar.

2. Using the secondary (right) mouse button, click the new command button
   object. Select Properties from the menu that appears.

3. Select the Layout tab in the Properties dialog box. Change the Caption
   property to QUIT.

4. Select the Methods tab in the Properties dialog box, and double-click the
   Click event to open the Code window for the Click Procedure of the command
   button. In the Code window for the Click event, type:

      THISFORM.RELEASE

   NOTE: This code differs from that used in the code example. The command
   THISFORM.RELEASE is used instead of CLEAR EVENTS because the READ EVENTS is
   not used to keep the form in memory when DO FORM <formname> is used.

5. Using the primary (left) mouse button, double-click the Form to open the Code
   window for the different events available for the Form.

6. Select Click from the Procedure list, and add the following code to this
   Click event:

      Local cColor cRGB
      m.cRGB = RGBSCHEME(1,2)
      m.cColor = 'RGB(' + SUBSTR(m.cRGB, AT(',', m.cRGB, 3) +1)
      This.BackColor = EVAL(cColor)

7. Save the Form, and run it.
