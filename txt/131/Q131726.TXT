TITLE   :PC Win: Err Msg: ...Too Many Entries Selected to Complete...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2,3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may not be able to retrieve a message that
was sent from Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks that has a large number of
individual recipients on the To: line. If this occurs, you may get the following
error:

   There are too many entries selected to complete the operation.
   Please select fewer entries.

The mail spooler will fail to pull this message into the mail message file (MMF).
The affected users will get the disconnected network icon, and the Windows
client will stop receiving mail.

NOTE: You will be able to read the same message in Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation.

CAUSE
=====

The above error will occur when a large number of recipients are selected to be
included on the To: line when you compose a message. However, the Mail for
AppleTalk Networks client does not have this limitation.

When the message arrives, the Windows client treats it as if it is a corrupt
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

You will have to sign into Mail using the MS-DOS client, and delete the "stuck"
message.

Users should use groups when sending mail to large number of recipients. This
will improve mail efficiency, as well.
