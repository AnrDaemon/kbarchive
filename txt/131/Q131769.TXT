TITLE   :Adding A Second Adaptec 154x SCSI Adapter Fails in Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a second Adaptec 154x SCSI host adapter, Windows NT 3.5 detects it,
but the initialization process fails and reports a memory conflict with the
first Adaptec 154x SCSI host adapter.

CAUSE
=====

When the Adaptec 154x SCSI host adapter driver performs detection of the second
adapter card, it incorrectly detects the BIOS already detected for the first
adapter card as BIOS of the second adapter card.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
