SUMMARY
=======

If the RowSourceType property of a combo box is set to SQL-Statement, the actual
SQL statement in the RowSource property must result in a cursor, not an array.
For example, if the RowSourceType property of a combo box is SQL-Statement, and
the RowSource property contains this command:

      SELECT DISTINCT REGION FROM CUSTOMER INTO CURSOR TEMP

the unique regions from the customer table are displayed in the combo box and a
cursor named TEMP is created

If the SELECT statement creates an array instead of a cursor, the combo box
displays data from the first field of the currently selected table. If no table
is currently selected, a syntax error displays.
