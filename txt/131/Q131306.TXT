The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro, it is now possible to update General Fields with the INSERT
SQL, UPDATE SQL, and REPLACE commands. These new capabilities are documented in
this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual FoxPro, the REPLACE command has been enhanced. It is now possible to
replace general field information from one table to another. For example:

      USE sourcetable
      SELECT 0
      USE desttable
      REPLACE desttable.genfield1 WITH sourcetable.genfield2

You can also move information within a record in the same way. For example:

      REPLACE genfield1 WITH genfield2

The INSERT SQL command has also been enhanced, making it possible to add a new
record to a table and place information in a general field in the table when the
information is contained in a general field of a different table. For example:

      USE sourcetable
      SELECT 0
      USE desttable
      INSERT INTO desttable ( genfield1 ) VALUES ( sourcetable.genfield2 )

The source table must be open; the general field is inserted from the current
record in that source table.

The UPDATE SQL command has been enhanced, making it possible to update a record
with information from another table. For example:

      USE sourcetable
      SELECT 0
      USE desttable
      UPDATE desttable ;
         SET genfield1 = sourcetable.genfield2 ;
         WHERE <filter expression>

The source table must be open; the general field is inserted from the current
record in that source table.
