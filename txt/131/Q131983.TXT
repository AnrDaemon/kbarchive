TITLE   :Server Halts On Invalid LPR Transaction
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A remote print client sends a print job to a Windows NT 3.5 print server using
LPR, and sends an illegal command causing the Windows NT print server to rapidly
fill its free disk space with temporary files. The Windows NT print server then
stops responding (hangs) without displaying an error message.


This problem has been observed outside the test lab only on an OSF/1 2.x LPR
client system.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete the problem print job from the print server
print queue. Any remaining print jobs will print.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server
version 3.51.

Additional query words: prodnt line printer remote daemon LPD
