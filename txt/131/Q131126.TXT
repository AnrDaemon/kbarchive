======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Wine Guide for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print more than 99 copies of the current Wine Selector wine list
to a LaserJet printer, only one copy prints.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print more than 99 copies of the selected list of wines, you need to print
the copies in two or more batches.

For example, if you want to print 100 copies, you can print two batches
containing 50 copies each.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PCL (Printer Control Language) is used in the LaserJet printer technology. PCL
is designed to print 1 to 99 copies even though higher numbers can be entered in
the Copies box. Other printer technologies are not affected by this problem
(i.e. inkjet).
