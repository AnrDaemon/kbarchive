TITLE   :ErrMsg:"Cannot Find VBRUN300.DLL" on Installing Moving Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Product Support Information

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Business Source Program includes distribution of the Moving
Wizard, a tool that creates a customized moving guide for switching to Microsoft
products. However, when you install the Moving Wizard you may receive the
following error message:

   Cannot Find VBRUN300.DLL

CAUSE
=====

Because VBRUN300.DLL is required for the Moving Wizard Setup program to run
successfully, this problem will occur if you do not have the file VBRUN300.DLL
installed in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

The VBRUN300.DLL file is compressed on the Moving Wizard disk. You can use the
file EXPAND.EXE, which is installed in the WINDOWS directory, to decompress
VBRUN300.DLL from the Moving Wizard disk and to place it in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory.

To do this, use the following steps:

1. Insert the Moving Wizard disk in your floppy disk drive.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, switch to your WINDOWS directory and type the
   following command and press ENTER:

   " expand <drive>:\vbrun300.dl_ c:\windows\system\vbrun300.dll "
   (without the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the floppy disk drive containing the Moving Wizard disk
   and where Windows is installed on your C drive and where the Windows System
   directory is called WINDOWS\SYSTEM.

This procedure will expand the file and copy it to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
You can now install the Moving Wizard.

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.
