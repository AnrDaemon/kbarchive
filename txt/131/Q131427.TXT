TITLE   :Windows NT 3.51 TCP/IP System Network Interface Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT computer running TCP/IP stops responding on the network. No frames
are sent from the network interface card (NIC), and incoming frames are not
seen. Local (non-network) processing continues to function normally.

NOTE: This problem rarely occurs. It was seen only once on a busy Internet
server.


CAUSE
-----

A router on the network responded to the server with an ICMP destination
unreachable (fragmentation requested, but with the DF bit set). It included an
advisement that the next-hop MTU size was one byte. This is an illegal MTU
value.

RESOLUTION
----------

To correct this problem, install Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 1.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
