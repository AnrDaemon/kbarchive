TITLE   :PRB: Length Not Updating Properly in Table Structure Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Table Structure dialog box brought up by the MODIFY STRUCTURE command,
the length information displayed at the bottom of the dialog box does not seem
correct. It adds one to the sum of the length of each field in the table.

CAUSE
=====

In the status bar of the Table Structure dialog box, the length information
displays the length of each record. It sums the length of each field, and adds
an additional byte, which flags whether or not the record is deleted. For
example, if the table has two fields, field1 C(20) and field2 C(20), the length
of the record is 20+20+1=41.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a New table. Add:

   Field1                 C    10
   Field2                 C    20

2. Verify the length displayed in the status bar of the table structure dialog
   box.
