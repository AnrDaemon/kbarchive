SUMMARY

Microsoft Windows NT provides Windows NT services to manage network processes

The following are the benefits from running network processes as Windows NT
services:

 - The External and Dispatch programs can be started automatically when the
   computer is turned on, without requiring an administrator to log on.

 - Specific External and Dispatch instances can be controlled using the Windows
   NT Service Control Manager.

 - Multiple instances of the External and Dispatch programs can run while the
   workstation is used for other purposes.

   workstation on the network.
