TITLE   :Printing Over LocalTalk Bridge Produces IOError
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a print job from a computer running Windows NT 3.5 Server to a
LocalTalk-connected print device on the far side of a LocalTalk bridge, the job
does not print correctly. Instead, the job is truncated and a PostScript IOError
message appears on an additional page.

Print jobs may be effected differently. Some print jobs rarely encounter the
problem while others encounter it nearly every time. If you send the same job
several times and the problem occurs several times, the truncation may appear at
slightly different points in the document.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 3.5 Services For Macintosh print monitor (SFMMON.DLL) fails to
set the EOM bit after sending the last frame of print job data, before sending
the Close Connection Request.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Server version 3.51.


Additional query words: prodnt end of message I/o
