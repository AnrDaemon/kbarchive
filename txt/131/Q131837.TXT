SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes, it may be necessary to exit or return from an event or method. This
article documents how to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For this article, assume you have created a form that requires at least one
parameter. When the form is run without being passed a parameter, you'd like to
cancel the form and issue an error message.

In version 2.x, you could do this with the RETURN command. In Visual FoxPro, the
process is similar but somewhat different because you must return a value of
false from the INIT method. The following code shows how to handle this type of
a situation in the INIT code of a form.

     PARAMETER tnMyParm
     IF PARAMETERS() < 1 OR EMPTY(tnMyParm)
          * Display a message
          * Release the form
          RETURN .F.
     ENDIF
     More init code ...

Returning a value of false (.F.) prevents the creation the object (a form in this
case).
