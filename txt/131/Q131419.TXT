SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to gain keyboard access to the high ANSI characters
(those above 128), which are the control characters, typically used in hot
(access) keys.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the left apostrophe (`) key to gain access to the control
characters. You will usually find the left apostrophe (`) key in the upper-left
corner of keyboard sharing a key with the tilde (~).

For example, set the font for the Command window to FoxFont. Then press the left
apostrophe ("`" (without the quotation marks)) key once followed by any other
key on the keyboard (try "a"). You will get a smiley face for a character. If a
font does not have extended characters, such as the Arial font, you will get a
box.

NOTE: to get the left apostrophe (`) character to show, you need to press the key
twice.

Although this does work on most systems, there have been reports that it does not
work on some systems.
