SUMMARY
=======

This article tells how to manually install Bookshelf 1995 for the Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The system resource files required to operate Bookshelf 1995 are in compressed
format on the CD-ROM. During a normal installation process each of the files is
decompressed and stored in the correct location on your hard drive.

However, because compressed files can not be copied to the computer from the
Bookshelf CD-ROM, the required system files listed below, must be installed
already on the computer. If these items are not present, features within
Bookshelf may not operate properly. Also, the appearance of Bookshelf fonts may
be incorrect.
