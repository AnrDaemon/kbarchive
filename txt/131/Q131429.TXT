SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a full system backup with Conner Backup Exec version 2.1, some
filenames appear garbled and the system stops responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

Conner Backup Exec 2.1 reads from the hard disk directly and sees long
filenames. However, this program does not support long filenames and cannot
successfully back up files that use long filenames.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use any one of the following methods:

 - Back up from another computer on the network. If you back up your computer
   from another computer on the network, Conner Backup Exec 2.1 does not see
   long filenames, but successfully uses the 8.3 filenames.

 - Do not perform a full system backup. Instead, select the files to back up,
   omitting files with long filenames.

 - Rename all the files that have long filenames to use 8.3-format filenames
   before you back up the system.

 - Backup your long filenames using the LFNBK.EXE utility included on the
   Windows 95 CD in the \Admin\Apptools\Lfnback folder. Follow the directions in
   the LFNBK.TXT file for instructions on how to use this utility. After
   performing the backup, restore the long filenames.
