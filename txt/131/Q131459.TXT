SUMMARY
=======

An MS-DOS-based (16-bit) RPC application cannot use TCP/IP as the protocol
sequence when running under Windows for Workgroup 3.11 with Microsoft's
TCP/IP-32 driver or Windows NT's WOW layer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS-based RPC applications that use TCP/IP as the protocol sequence to
communicate are designed to run only over Microsoft's real mode TCP/IP driver
for Microsoft LAN Manager client software for MS-DOS or any other compatible
real-mode TCP/IP driver implementation.

Windows for Workgroup's TCP/IP-32 protocol driver and Windows NT's WOW layer do
not provide the same real-mode interface for TCP/IP as provided by the Microsoft
LAN Manager TCP/IP driver.

When an MS-DOS-based RPC application tries to use TCP/IP as the protocol sequence
under Windows for Workgroups with Microsoft's TCP/IP-32 driver or Windows NT's
WOW layer, RPC run time report exception 27(0x1b).
