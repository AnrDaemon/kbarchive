======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open Control Panel, you may see two ODBC icons.

CAUSE
=====

You see two ODBC icons if the ODBCCP32.CPL file is in the System folder under
the Windows folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove or rename the ODBCCP32.CPL file in the System folder under the Windows
folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways to display the ODBC icon in Control Panel. The default method
is for the ODBCCP32.DLL file to be in the System folder under the Windows
folder, with the following entry in [MMCPL] section of the CONTROL.INI file:

   ODBC32=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ODBCCP32.DLL

The second method is to place the ODBCCP32.CPL file in the System folder under
the Windows folder. Control Panel automatically loads all *.CPL files in the
System folder.

Applications that use the default method may not detect or remove *.CPL files in
the System folder, causing duplicate icons.
