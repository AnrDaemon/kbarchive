SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run the IBM DIAGS.COM utility in a windowed MS-DOS prompt
session, the utility does not run and you receive the following error message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be terminated. Quit
   all programs, and then restart your computer.

If you click the Details button you receive the following information:

   The program tried to execute an invalid instruction.

adapter directly. This adapter is protected by the Windows 95 protected-mode
network adapter driver.

follow these steps:

   on the menu that appears.

3. Click the Program tab, then click the Advanced button.

4. Click the MS-DOS Mode check box, then click OK.
