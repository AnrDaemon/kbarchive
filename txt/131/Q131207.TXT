TITLE   :WINS Manager Fails to Add Static Entries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT 3.5 WINS Manager on a computer running Windows NT
Workstation 3.51, you cannot add or edit static entries and cannot enter any IP
addresses.

CAUSE
=====

The files are incompatible.

This situation occurs when you copied the files required to do WINS
administration from the Windows NT 3.5 Server compact disc to the computer
running Windows NT Workstation 3.5, and then subsequently upgraded to Windows NT
3.51. The WINS manager files are not upgraded when you upgrade a computer
running Windows NT Workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, manually expand and copy the following files from the
Windows NT Server 3.51 compact disc to the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 directory:

   winsadmn.exe
   winsrpc.dll
   winsadmn.hlp
   ipadrdll.dll

Additional query words: prodnt admin mappings
