TITLE   :PC Win: Err Msg: Some Entries Could Not Be Added to the Group
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,3.2,3.2a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you attempt to
add one or more external or gateway users to a Personal Group, where one or more
of the addresses currently exist in the Personal Address Book (PAB), and
IMPORT.EXE as well as REBUILD.EXE has been executed on the postoffice, the
following error may occur:

   Some entries could not be added to the group.

CAUSE
=====

If the entries were originally added to the PAB from the Global Address List
(GAL), and IMPORT.EXE and REBUILD.EXE were executed on the postoffice, the
Windows client thinks that a discrepancy has occurred between the account
information being added and the current entry in the PAB; even though no change
has been made to the actual address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.2, and 3.2a of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching the problem and will post new
information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.00b 3.20 3.20a
