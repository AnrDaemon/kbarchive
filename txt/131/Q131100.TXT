SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for COleClientItem::DoDragDrop(),
COleServerItem::DoDragDrop(), and COleDataSource::DoDragDrop() give the
following incorrect information for the lpRectStartDrag parameter:

In Visual C++ Prior to 5.0
--------------------------

   lpRectStartDrag:

   Pointer to the rectangle that defines where the drag
   actually starts. It does not start until the mouse cursor leaves the
   rectangle. If NULL, a default rectangle is used so that the drag
   starts when the mouse cursor moves one pixel.

In Visual C++ 5.0
-----------------

Call the DoDragDrop member function to perform a drag-and-drop operation. The
drag-and-drop operation does not start immediately. It waits until the mouse
cursor leaves the rectangle specified by lpRectStartDrag or until a specified
number of milliseconds have passed. If lpRectStartDrag is NULL, the size of the
rectangle is one pixel. The delay time is specified by the DragDelay value in
the [Windows] section of WIN.INI. If this value is not in WIN.INI, the default
value of 200 milliseconds is used.

Correction
----------

The documentation for the lpRectStartDrag parameter for DoDragDrop() should be:

   lpRectStartDrag:

   Pointer to the rectangle that defines where the drag
   actually starts. It does not start until the mouse cursor leaves the
   rectangle or until a specific number of milliseconds has passed. If
   NULL, a default rectangle is used so that the drag starts when the
   mouse cursor moves one pixel. The number of milliseconds is specified
   by a registry key setting. The value can be found in the Windows NT
   system registry under the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ 
   Windows\NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping\win.ini\Windows\DragDelay,
   or in the WIN.INI file under the [Windows] section if running under
   Windows version 3.x. If the key is not present, a default value of 200
   milliseconds is used.

This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0 for Windows.
