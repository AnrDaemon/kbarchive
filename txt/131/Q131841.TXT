TITLE   :Glyph Problems With Automatic Type 1 To TrueType Font Converte
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT 3.5 automatic Type 1 to TrueType font converter exhibits the
following problems:

 - It is unable to handle repeated encoding.

   If a glyph appears in more than one place in the encoding vector, then one
   occurrence of the glyph is lost.

 - It is unable to handle character code zero.

 - It overwrites glyph character code 173 with glyph character code 45.

   The Windows character codes 45 and 173 are hyphens "-". The converter copies
   character code 45 to character code 173.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5 or upgrade to Windows NT 3.51.

STATUS
======

problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the

This problem was also corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TrueType and Adobe Type 1 fonts are outline fonts, containing glyph shapes that
are described by their outlines. A glyph outline consists of a series of
contours that define the boundaries of the glyph. Some glyphs are simple, such
as most letters and punctuation marks, but some can be quite complex. For
example, a company logo with graphics and text might be encoded in a font as a
single glyph.
