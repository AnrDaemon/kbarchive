KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run External or Dispatch from the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for
Windows NT (NT MMTA) as a Service, the following error may occur:

   Could not start the Mail External - (instance) service on \\computer name.

   Error 1069: The service did not start due to a logon failure

CAUSE
=====

When you create a new user with User Manager for Domains, the default User
Property is User Must Change Password at Next Logon. If this option is checked
for the NT MMTA service account, it will cause this error. Windows NT cannot
present a change password dialog to a Service account.

This error will also occur the first time you try to start the service if you
have not granted the account the right to logon as a service.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the option
--------------------

1. Run User Manager for Domains from the Administrative Tools group.

2. Double-click the Service account user.

3. Click the Password Never Expires property, and choose the OK button.

If you have not granted the account the right to logon as a service, in Control
Panel Services, select the service, and select Startup. A dialog box will be
displayed that states, "This account has been granted the right to log on as a
service."
