SUMMARY
=======

In the debug window, an entry may have the value of "(Object)."

MORE INFORMATION
================

An entry in the debug window will have a value of "(Object)" if it refers to an
object, not a property of an object. For example, if you enter the following in
the debug window, the value will be (Object), because it references the Form
object not a property of that form:

    _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM

On the other hand, if you place _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.NAME in the debug window, the
value will be the name of the form.

Run a form and place _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM and _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.NAME in the debug
window to see the difference.
