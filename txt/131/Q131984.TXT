When you send print jobs via TCP/IP from both a Windows NT system and an
HP UX system to an HP print device equipped with an JetDirect adapter, the
job from the HP UX system finishes printing sooner.

NOTE: HP UX refers To Hewlett-Packard's version of the UNIX operating
system that is commonly found on the HP 9000 computer.

If the HP UX system knows it is sending to an HP JetDirect adapter, it
uses a proprietary print method to send the print job. This method is
optimized for the HP JetDirect adapter and sends data more quickly
than is possible with an RFC1179-compliant LPR utility, such as those
provided with Windows NT version 3.5 and later.
