KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive different results when trying to access a share from a Windows NT
client versus a Windows for Workgroups client if the share is on an NTFS
partition and the NTFS directory permissions have been revoked for the user on
this share.

 - From the Windows for Workgroups client you can connect to the share, however
   the following error appears:

   No File Found

 - From a Windows NT client you are not be able to connect to the share, and the
   following error appears:

   You do not have permission to access this directory

As a result, from the Windows for Workgroups computer, you can access a
subdirectory of this share if you have permission on it, but from the Windows NT
client, you cannot access the share or any subdirectory under it.

CAUSE
=====

The server returns an SMB_ERR_NO_FILES response to the Windows for Workgroups
client and an STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED response to the Windows NT client.

WORKAROUND
==========

Directly share the subdirectory when you must revoke permissions on its parent
share.
