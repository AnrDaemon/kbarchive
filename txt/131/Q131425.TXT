TITLE   :Windows NT Recognizes Only One Processor On HP XU 5/90C
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on a Hewlett-Packard Vectra XU 5/90C that has two
processors, Windows NT Setup recognizes only one processor. Windows NT Setup
identifies the computer as a Standard PC.

CAUSE
=====

The HP XU 5/90C is using a BIOS version earlier than GO.05.08. Windows NT is
unable to detect multiple processors on this system with earlier BIOS versions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade the BIOS on the HP Vectra XU 5/90C to version
GO.05.08 or later. The GO.05.08 BIOS upgrade is available for download from the
HP bulletin board service (BBS) at (208) 344-1691, or from CompuServe in the
HPSYS forum. Download GO0508US.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Hewlett-Packard XU 5/90C uses a motherboard that contains a socket for a
Pentium P54CM processor. When you add that chip, the system is upgraded to a
dual-Pentium configuration.

When the updated BIOS is installed, Windows NT Setup correctly selects MPS 1.1
Multiprocessor PC, not Standard PC.
