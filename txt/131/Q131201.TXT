KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Reports created and saved in Visual FoxPro contain printer setup information
stored in the EXPR field of the first record in the report (.FRX) file. Only
those options valid for the printer associated with the report are saved. You
can use the PRTINFO() function to verify the value contained in the individual
element, but the EXPR field contains all printer elements available to the
report.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following lists all 13 report elements that can be saved with the report:

ORIENTATION(1)
PAPERSIZE(2)
PAPERLENGTH(3)
PAPERWIDTH(4)
SCALE(5)
COPIES(6)
DEFAULTSOURCE(7)
PRINTQUALITY(8)
COLOR(9)
DUPLEX(10)
YRESOLUTION(11)
TTOPTION(12)
COLLATE(13)

These 13 options are the only setup elements that change the user's current
printer setup. This is true of both the binary setup information and the clear
text. The numbers in parentheses correspond to the PRTINFO() function that
allows read access to these fields. Each option is fully explained in the
PRTINFO() topic in the Visual FoxPro Help file.

To verify the above information, follow these steps:

1. Create a new report in Visual FoxPro.

2. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

3. In the Page Setup dialog box, select Printer Setup. In the printer Setup
   dialog box, make changes to the default printer, orientation, and paper size.

4. Click the More button, and make changes to the remaining elements.

5. Save and run the report.

6. Open the report file as a .DBF file using the USE command.

7. In Browse mode, open the EXPR Memo field. All saved printer setup elements
   are visible.
