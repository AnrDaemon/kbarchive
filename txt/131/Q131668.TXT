OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Thomas Conrad network adapter, you receive the following
error message when you use the NET START command:

   Error opening EAGLEMAC.BIN
   Press any key to continue...

When you press a key, your computer stops responding (hangs). This problem occurs
only if you are loading real-mode (NDIS 2) drivers for the network adapter, and
is known to occur with the following Thomas Conrad network adapter models:

 - TC4045

 - TC4045-C


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the EAGLEMAC.BIN file is not located in the root
directory. Windows 95 requires that this file be located in the root directory
in order for it to be loaded properly.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, move or copy the EAGLEMAC.BIN file from its current
location to the root directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
