======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a mail message in versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for
Windows, you may see the following error as the body of the message instead of
the message:

   This message could not be fully recovered.

CAUSE
=====

If there are multiple copies of a message in a single Mail Message File (MMF),
and the CHKMMF utility has been run against the MMF, all iterations of the
message will display this error instead of the message body.

There will be a copy of the message in the Lost and Found folder that is created
by the CHKMMF utility.

If, however, there are attachments with the messages, the attachments will be
lost.
