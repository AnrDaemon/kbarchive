TITLE   :How to Set the Maximum Design Area for a Form

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to set the maximum design area for the Form Designer in the
Options dialog box. To access the Options dialog box, choose Options from the
Tools menu, and select the Forms tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The maximum design area specifies a maximum size of the form for design time.
Visual FoxPro won't let you size a form to be bigger than the specified display
resolution. It is a good idea to specify the smallest resolution your users will
want, so that your forms are viewable in all resolutions.

Important Notes to Keep in Mind
-------------------------------

Although not covered in the Developers Guide or Help file, if you have a form
open while setting the maximum design area, the setting won't affect the open
form or form set until you close and reopen it. Also, note that setting the
maximum design area affects all forms open during the current session of FoxPro;
if you click the "Set as Default" button, it will affect all future sessions
too.

If you have a form designed with, for example, an 800 by 600 maximum design area
and it fills most of the white design area in that mode, Visual FoxPro lets you
increase or decrease the maximum design area. If you decrease the maximum design
area to, for example, 640 by 480, your form becomes larger than the design area,
and you won't be able to access all of the form until you close it, set up the
proper maximum design area, and reopen the form.

You should set the maximum design area before you use the Form Wizard to create
your form.
