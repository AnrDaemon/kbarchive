 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5,3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Control Panel, choose Display, choose Change Display Type, choose
change, select Show Compatible Devices, select a video driver different than the
one currently installed, choose OK, and then shutdown and restart Windows NT,
the change is lost.

To work around this problem, do not select Show Compatible Devices. If you leave
Show All Devices selected, selecting a new video driver will work correctly.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
