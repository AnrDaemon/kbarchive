SUMMARY
=======

I_AutoLogon is the only documented API for doing a programmatic logon from
Windows for Workgroups. This API requires the user to type a user name and
password. There aren't any other documented functions for performing logons. In
particular, there is nothing documented to:

 - Perform a programmatic logon using a specific user name and password.

 - Perform a programmatic logon to a particular domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to perform a logon in an indirect fashion by executing a batch
file that calls NET LOGON. For example, you might have a file named LOGON.BAT
that contains:

   REM batch file that performs a logon
   NET LOGON <username> <password> /DOMAIN:<mydomain>

You can use WinExec to execute the batch file:

   WinExec( "LOGON.BAT", SW_HIDE );
