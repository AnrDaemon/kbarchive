TITLE   :[LogonHistory] not Complete when Switching Site/Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you logon to another site/domain, the "Different Site/Domain combination"
message appears, as does a message stating that you will be switched to this
site/domain if you logon two more consecutive times. If you logon to a different
site/domain combination than the one previous, the logon counter is decremented
even though this is the first time you logged on to the site/domain.

CAUSE
=====

SMS is not keeping track of the Site that the user logs on to. When you attempt
to switch a site/domain, you must logon three times for the changes to take
effect. On the first and second attempts, INVDOS should update the
[LogonHistory] section in the SMS.INI file:

   [LogonHistory]
   Entry=<3-digit Site Code>:<Domain Name>
   Counter=<# attempts>

The Entry attribute is not being set by INVDOS. Without this entry, you can
attempt to logon to any three different site/domain combinations and will login
to the site/domain designated at the third logon attempt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack
for Systems Management Server. For information on obtaining this update, query
