SYMPTOMS

When you start a HyperTerminal connection, you receive the following error
message:

   The TAPI configuration has changed and the modem/port selected for this
   session is no longer valid.

CAUSE
=====

When you create a connectoid in HyperTerminal, it is associated with a
particular modem on a particular port. If, after you create the connectoid, the
modem is removed, you receive the error message stated above when you try to use
the connection. This error message indicates that the modem associated with the
connectoid has been removed, and that the system has identified a likely
alternative.

RESOLUTION
==========

Click OK to acknowledge the error message. There should be no effect on the
connection if the connection is associated with a valid modem.
