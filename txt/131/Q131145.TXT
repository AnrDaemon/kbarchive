SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to add properties or methods to buttons in a
command-button group

MORE INFORMATION
================

Neither properties nor methods can be added directly to buttons in a
command-button group. This is by design. Properties or methods added to a button
in a command-button group appear as part of the command-button group object, not
part of the button itself.

To add properties or methods to a button in a command-button group, you must:

1. Subclass the command button in the Class Designer.

2. Add the property or method there.

3. Create a container class.

4. Add the new button class to the new container.

Steps to Add a Property or Method to a Command Button
-----------------------------------------------------

1. From the file menu, choose New. Select Class as the file type, and click New
   File.

2. Type in a class name for this new class, select CommandButton from the Based
   on menu, and enter a .VCX file name to store the class in. You can use one
   that already exists or enter a new .VCX file name for Visual FoxPro to
   create.

3. When the Visual Class Designer window appears, choose New Property from the
   Class menu. Enter a name for this new property in the name text box of the
   New Property dialog box. Click the OK button, and scroll through the property
   sheet for this class. Notice that your new property appears at the bottom of
   the list. This property defaults to value of false (.F.).

4. Close and save the changes to this new class.

5. Create another new class (see step 1) based on a container.

6. Click the View Classes button of the Form Controls toolbar. Select Add, and
   choose the .VCX file you just created. From this file, select the class you
   created if prompted.

7. Click the commandbutton button on this new toolbar. Then click the container
   window in the Visual Class Designer. This adds a command button to the
   container that has the property you added by subclassing the commandbutton
   class in step 2 above.
