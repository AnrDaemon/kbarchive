In Event Viewer Help incorrectly states the following:

   When you select this option, each new event replaces the oldest event if the
   log is full. This option is the default and the best choice for ease of
   maintenance.

The "Overwrite Events Older than 7 days" option in Event Viewer is the
default option. To verify this, choose the Default button in the Event
Viewer Log Settings dialog box.

To see the above text in Event Viewer:

1. Choose "Use and Manage Event Logs."

2. Choose "Setting Options for Logging Events."

3. Choose "Overwrite Events as Needed."
