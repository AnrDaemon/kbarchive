TITLE   :XCLN: Message Finder and Filter Don't Display Bcc'd Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The message finder (choose Find from the Tools menu) and filter (choose Filter
from the View menu) do not display messages that were blind carbon copied
(Bcc'd) when you select Copied (Cc) To Me.

CAUSE
=====

The message finder and filter do not treat Bcc'd messages in the same manner as
Cc'd messages. Therefore, Bcc'd messages are not displayed during the message
find or filter. While both messages are carbon copies, the Bcc'd message does
not have the Bcc'd user's name in the header--only the names of the sender,
original recipient (the name on the To line), and Cc's appear. Since the Bcc'd
recipient's name does not appear in the message, the Finder and Filter cannot
display the message.
