The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro uses a temporary file when you print or preview an unsaved new
Report file. This is different from version 2.6 where it used the file name
Untitled.frx.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you create a new report file in Visual FoxPro, it will be named Report1. When
you select Run Report from the Report menu, this command is generated:

      REPORT FORM C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\08824737.TMP NOEJECT NOCONSOLE TO PRINTER

In FoxPro version 2.x the same type of procedure (choosing Report from the
Database menu) generates this command:

      REPORT FORM C:\fpw\untitled.frx ENVIRONMENT TO PRINTER
