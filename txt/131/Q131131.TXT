TITLE   :Winlogon Memory Leak Caused by SNMP Components
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a remote machine connects to a computer running Windows NT 3.5 with
Performance Monitor, the remote system will leak a small amount of paged pool
memory. This shows up as a consumption of paged pool memory by the Winlogon
process on the remote computer.

CAUSE
=====

When the performance registry key is opened, the TCP/IP performance counters
load the INETMIB1.DLL library and call SnmpExtensionInit to initialize the SNMP
counters. This process causes two handles to be created that are not closed when
the library is freed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install Windows NT 3.51.


STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
