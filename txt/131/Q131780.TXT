TITLE   :Using the /E Option With CACLS.EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To change user permissions on a Windows NT file system (NTFS) directory or
file, you must use the /E option in addition to /R (revoke), /G (grant),
and /P (change) when using CACLS.EXE. If you already have permissions set
for multiple users on a directory or file and do not use the /E option, all
user permissions are removed except for the user and permission specified
on the command line.

The following syntax should be used when modifying user permissions:

   CACLS <filename or directory> /E /R <username>
   CACLS <filename or directory> /E /G <username>:<permission>
   CACLS <filename or directory> /E /P <username>:<permission>

where <permission> is R (Read), C (Change - write), or F (Full control).

Type the following at the command line for information on other options:

   CACLS /?

NOTE: The /E option modifies the directory or file ACL instead of replacing
the ACL with new users and permissions.
