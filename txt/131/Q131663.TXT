PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows 95, you may receive the following error
message:

   Error SU0358

   Setup detected one or more MS-DOS-based programs running on your computer.
   Close your MS-DOS programs, and then click OK to continue. Or, click Cancel
   to quit Setup.

CAUSE
=====

Setup cannot continue while an MS-DOS-based program is running. The MS-DOS-based
program may be running in a hidden virtual machine so that it is not visible
when you press ALT+TAB or in the Close Program dialog box.

NOTE: Windows 95 supports running MS-DOS-based programs in hidden virtual
machines (VMs). Hidden VMs do not display program windows or show up as running
programs. Hidden VMs are created by the developer of a program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use any one of the following methods:

 - Press ALT+TAB to cycle through the running programs and close the
   MS-DOS-based program.

 - Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to open the Close Program dialog box and close the
   MS-DOS-based program.

 - Cancel Setup. Remove the MS-DOS-based program from the Startup group or from
   the Load= or Run= line in the WIN.INI file and then restart Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WinPrinter driver by LaserMaster is an example of an MS-DOS-based program
that runs in a hidden VM and is not visible when you press ALT+TAB or
CTRL+ALT+DEL. To disable WinPrinter, remove the WinPrinter icons from the
Startup group, restart the computer, and then run Windows 95 Setup again.
