TITLE   :Net Session Command Does Not Interpret Redirected Input
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a batch file (for example, TEST) that contains a carriage return
and linefeed character, and you direct this file to the NET SESSION command as
follows,

   NET SESSION /DELETE <TEST

the command will request a response with the statement,

   Do you want to continue this operation(Y/N) [Y]

but then it will return the error:

   No valid response was provided.

0D 0A (carriage return and linefeed) are valid characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the /Y parameter to provide the default Yes
response. For example:

   NET SESSIONS /DELETE /Y

The /Y parameter is not documented at this time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5,
and 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
