The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Use the exclamation mark (!) notation to reference tables in databases (.DBC
files). Use it to reference tables that have the same names but that exist in
different databases, and use it to make code more readable. Its main purpose is
to guarantee the opening of a specific table.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here is the syntax:

      USE <cDatabase_name>!<cTable_name>

NOTE: Do not put spaces on either side of the exclamation mark.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create the following directory structure:

   C:\MAIN
   C:\MAIN\ONE
   C:\MAIN\TWO

   This can be done Visual FoxPro by issuing these commands:

   CD C:\ 
   MD MAIN
   CD C:\MAIN
   MD ONE
   MD TWO

2. Issue the following commands in the Command Window:

      CD C:\MAIN\ONE
      CREATE TABLE tb_mytbl (fld1 c(10))
      CD C:\MAIN\TWO
      CREATE TABLE tb_mytbl (fld1 c(10))
      USE
      CD C:\MAIN
      CREATE DATABASE db_one
      ADD TABLE C:\MAIN\ONE\tb_mytbl
      CREATE DATABASE db_two
      ADD TABLE C:\MAIN\ONE\tb_mytbl
      SET DATABASE TO db_one

   These commands set up a scenario where a database named db_one contains a
   table named tb_mytbl, which is located in the C:\MAIN\ONE directory. Another
   database named db_two contains a different table named tb_mytbl, which is
   located in the C:\MAIN\TWO directory.

   The issue is to open the tb_mytbl table in the db_two database. The current
   database is db_one, so you can't use this command:

         USE tb_mytbl

   It would open the table in db_one located in C:\MAIN\ONE.

3. Open the tb_mytbl table in the db_two database by using this command:

      USE db_two!tb_mytbl

The exclamation mark (!) notation works in the same manner for long table names,
and it makes code more readable. The notation makes it clear exactly which
database holds the table of interest. It is especially useful in SQL-SELECT
statements.
