SUMMARY
=======

Individual users cannot create their own post office accounts in Microsoft
Exchange in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a Microsoft Exchange profile that includes Microsoft Mail, you
are prompted for a path to the post office. A list of user accounts for that
post office is then displayed. If your account is not displayed, you must
contact the post office administrator to have an account created.

Note that this behavior is different from that of the Microsoft Mail client
included with Windows for Workgroups. In Microsoft Mail in Windows for
Workgroups, you can set up your own post office account.

Windows 95 post offices are created and managed using the Microsoft Workgroup
Postoffice Admin tool included with Windows 95. To use this tool, double-click
the Microsoft Mail Postoffice icon in Control Panel.
