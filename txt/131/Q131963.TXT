and Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT. The server MUST be version 3.51 to implement
this fix.

This fix is available only on Windows NT 3.51. If this fix is required and
Windows NT 3.51 is not the current version being used, Product Support has been
authorized to send a Windows NT 3.51 server step-up upgrade CD-ROM. The latest
