-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following statement from the System Guide for Microsoft Windows NT Server
version 3.5 is incorrect:

   After you change any environment variables in the System dialog box and
   choose the OK button, Windows NT saves the new values in the Registry so they
   are available automatically the next time you start your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Windows NT version 3.5 the environment variables are immediately available
after you select the OK button.

You do not need to restart the computer after you change an environment variable
in the Control Panel System dialog box.
