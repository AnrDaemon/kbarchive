PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the new versions of the 32-bit files for Visual FoxPro,

crashing.

CAUSE
=====

The computer may have a third-party virtual-device driver installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the [386Enh] section of the SYSINI.INI file, set the MaxBPs to 400 or
greater.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 SYSINI.WRI.

   [386Enh] Section Settings

   The [386Enh] section contains information used for virtual-memory
   page swapping; virtual-memory network drivers; and 32-bit disk
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   The [386Enh] section can contain the following setting

   MaxBPs=<number>

   Default: 200

   Purpose: Specifies the maximum number of break points (a method for
   transferring control to Windows running in 386 enhanced mode) that
   can be used by the virtual-memory manager. You may need to increase this
   value if you are using a third-party virtual-device driver that requires
   more break points than the default value.
