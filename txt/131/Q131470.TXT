SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a batch job with more than ten PRINT commands, the following error
message appears the eleventh time Windows NT attempts to print:

   Unable to initialize device lpt1

Only ten jobs are queued to print.

The repeated command in the batch file is:

   PRINT /D:LPT1 C:\FILENAME.TXT

If you connect to a shared printer, this problem does not occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select "Share this printer on the network" in the Create Printer or Printer
Properties dialog box for your printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will

available.
