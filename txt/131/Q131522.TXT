-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, and you
attempt to access a .CAL file on another postoffice with only Novell NetWare
Directory Services (NDS) enabled, you may experience the following error
message:

   The Schedule file could not be opened. You may not have the necessary access
   privileges or the file may be unavailable.

Schedule+ Dynamic Connections will fail and cannot connect to the server.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ will not work with NDS alone. The NetWare API calls made by Schedule+
expect a bindery user or bindery type of log in.

NOTE: Bindery in Novell is the name of the security files used in NetWare 2.x and
3.x servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable Bindery Emulation on all servers and workstations participating in
Schedule+ Dynamic Connections.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Schedule+ Schedule Distribution also requires that Bindery Emulation be
enabled.

You can use either the VLM or NETX to attach to a version 3.11 or 4.x server with
Bindery Emulation. NETX will not work against a 4.x server without Bindery
Emulation.
