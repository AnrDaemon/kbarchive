======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks (NWREDIR.VXD) to print to
a NetWare print queue, print notification is not an option in the properties for
the printer.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 provides the following common Novell NetWare capture settings:

 - Banner Page

 - Form Feed

 - Expand Tabs

 - Form

 - Timeout

Capture settings that do not appear in the printer properties can be enabled
using the NetWare CAPTURE command.

RESOLUTION
==========

To receive notification when a print job is finished on a NetWare print queue,
follow these steps:

1. Use the following command in your user or system login script

   capture L=<x> /server=<y> /queue=<z> /notify

   where <x> is the LPT port, <y> is the NetWare server name, and
   <z> is the NetWare print queue name you are using.

   For more information about the CAPTURE command, please consult your NetWare
   administrator, documentation, or dealer.

2. Install the printer. Make sure that the "Print to the following port" setting
   is set to the port you are using, not to the printe's UNC name.

3. Run Winpopup.exe from the Windows directory. (Winpopup.exe is installed when
   you install the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks or NetWare Networks.)

After you follow these steps, the NetWare print server uses WinPopUp to send you
print notifications.
