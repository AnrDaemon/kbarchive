SUMMARY
=======

When you create a user, there is an option to include the user in Directory
Synchronization (Dir-Sync). If the user is included in Dir-Sync, but the
requirement to keep the user in the Postoffice Address List but remove the user
from Dir-Sync is needed, you can Modify the user; select N to not include the
user in Dir-Sync. This will create a Delete transaction in the REQTRANS.GLB that
will delete the user from all Requestors participating in Dir-Sync.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An alternative method is to use Import. Use a text editor to create a file with
the following format:

   D in Col 1   Alias name in  3 - 33 ,  in col 34 address
   type:network/po/username

For example:

   D  User1 alias                  PCM:NET1/PO1/USER1

Use the following command to import the file into a Requestor (preferably the
Dir-Sync server):

   Import Admin -ppassword   -E  -ffilename.txt  -ddrive

The deletion will be sent to all the participating Requestors for deletion from
their .USR files without effecting the address in the Postoffice Address List.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.20 3.20a 3.50 import dirsync delete usr
