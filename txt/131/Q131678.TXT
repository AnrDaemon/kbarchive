PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start an instance of the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT
(NT MMTA) as a Service, and you open a monitor window to that instance, the
following error message may occur:

   WARNING: Unable to open specified INI file.

No errors will be logged.

CAUSE
=====

The path to the EXTERNAL.INI file as specified in the Microsoft Mail Service
Manager is incorrect or points to a drive that is not available at the time the
instance starts.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is recommended to have the EXTERNAL.INI file used by the NTMMTA located in
the local C: drive of the computer running External. This will avoid the problem
causing this error message and other problems. You must have the EXTERNAL.EXE
and associated files in the local drive, not in a network drive.
