TITLE   :Event Error 5712 with Status Access Denied
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT PDC (Primary Domain Controller) is rebooted, event 5712
warnings appear in the event log, indicating that BDC's (Backup Domain
Controller's) attempts to synchronize have failed. The Detail Description of the
error log is:

   The partial synchronization request from the server <BDC_server_name>
   failed with the following error: Access is denied.

The Detail Data of the error log is:

   0000: c0000022

NOTE: c0000022 is defined as Status_Access_Denied.

CAUSE
=====

When the Netlogon service starts on the rebooted PDC, it sends a pulse to the
BDC indicating that it needs to synchronize with the accounts databases on the
PDC. The BDC responds with a partial synch request. However, a secure channel
with the PDC is required to complete the request. Because the BDC had a secure
channel with the PDC before the PDC was rebooted, it attempts to submit the
partial synch request without establishing a new secure channel. The request
fails with Access Denied. After receiving the Access Denied status from the PDC,
the BDC requests a new secure channel and completes the partial synch request
successfully.

RESOLUTION
==========

Event 5712 messages due to Access Denied are common immediately after the reboot
of a PDC. They are not necessarily harmful, and do not mean that the BDC is
unable to synchronize with the PDC.

As a test to see if the 5712 warning is important, force a synchronization with
the PDC from the BDC and check the event log on the BDC. If the Netlogon
messages in the BDC event log indicate that the synchronization attempt with the
PDC was successful, then the warnings on the PDC can be ignored.

NOTE: This article discusses a single cause of 5712 errors. If your BDC is unable
to synchronize with the PDC when you force it to in Server Manager, then the
Secure Channel account on the BDC may have an invalid password.
