KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler for MS-DOS, version 5.1 
 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A run-time error that occurs on a line with an ELSEIF statement is reported to
have occurred on the line where the starting IF is located.

NOTE: The /4Yb 'Extended error handling' option needs to be used in order for the
line numbers to be displayed along with the error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NOTE: This behavior does not occur with FORTRAN PowerStation 32.

Sample Code to Demonstrate Problem
----------------------------------

   C
   C  Compile options needed: /4Yb
   C
   C  This program should give error F6096 when run
         PROGRAM ElseIfTest

   C  Declare the variables
         INTEGER*4 A(8)
         INTEGER*4 I
         INTEGER*4 S

   C  Initialize the variables
         A = 0
         I = 0
         S = 2

   C  Begin the IF statement
         IF (S .EQ. 1) THEN              !  Error reported on this line
             PRINT *,'Equals One'
         ELSEIF (A(I) .GT. 1) THEN       !  Error occurs on this line
             PRINT *,''
