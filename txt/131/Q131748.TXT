KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows 95 over an existing version of Windows or
Windows for Workgroups version 3.x on an AT&T Globalyst model 515 or 590
computer, the computer may stop responding (hang) when Setup accesses the CD-ROM
drive.


This problem is known to occur with the NEC CDR-260 CD-ROM drive with the Oak
CD17F14A.SYS CD-ROM driver version 1.7_F14A.

CAUSE
=====

The CD17F14A.SYS driver uses INT14h to access the CD-ROM drive, which also
causes a problem in Windows and Windows for Workgroups 3.x. This problem occurs
when you access the CD-ROM drive in File Manager in Windows or Windows for
Workgroups 3.x as well, and is not a problem with Windows 95 Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, restart your computer and install Windows 95 from an
MS-DOS command prompt. If Windows 3.x starts automatically when you start your
computer, quit Windows 3.x before you install Windows 95.
