SYMPTOMS
========

When you map a network drive to a Novell network server, you may receive the
following error message:

   Drive <X> is in use by a local drive. Do you want to assign it as a
   network drive? (Y/N)

If you choose Yes, you then receive the error message

   Volume does not exist: <X>: = <SERVER\SYS:PUBLIC>

where <X> is the drive letter that was mapped and <SERVER\SYS:PUBLIC>
is the Novell network server, volume, and directory.

CAUSE
=====

You cannot map a drive letter to a Novell (NCP) network server if that drive
letter is already assigned to a Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups, or LAN Manager SMB server. The protected-mode NCP redirector
(NWREDIR) cannot distinguish between an existing network connection and a local
drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disconnect the existing network connection, or use a different drive letter to
map to the Novell network server. To disconnect the existing connection, follow
these steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the network drive, then click Disconnect
   on the menu that appears.
