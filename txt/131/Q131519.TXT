The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an appointment and the date format is set to m/d/yy, Schedule+
only recognizes the last two digits of the year. For example, 1902 is changed to
2002, and 2999 is changed to 1999.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.
