SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a message in versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows
with over 350 addresses in the To: line or enough addresses to span a printed
page, and one or more addresses in the Cc: line with information in the Subject:
field, and text typed in the body of the message, the following may occur:

 - The addresses that would span the printed page are missing on the printed
   page.

 - The addresses on the Cc: line are missing.

 - The text that was typed in the Subject: line is missing.

CAUSE
=====

The To: address line will not except carriage return control characters. It will
see them as an invalid address.

RESOLUTION

You can create a Personal Group of individual addresses and print that group for
record keeping.

STATUS
