TITLE   :Access Denied When Connecting From Pathworks 4.1 Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect from a DEC Pathworks version 4.1 client computer to
a Windows NT version 3.5 share, the following error message appears:

   Access Denied

CAUSE
=====

Security between Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5 is implemented differently. In Windows
NT 3.1, DEC Pathworks 4.1 clients running the DEC basic redirector are able to
connect to the Windows NT server or workstation without setting a LAN Manager
username and password (using Setlogon) on the DEC Pathworks 4.1 client computer.
In Windows NT 3.5, the username and password are required to be set on the
client computer.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - Run the SETLOGON command in the STARTNET.BAT file on the Pathworks client to
   set the LAN Manager username and password. The syntax for SETLOGON is:

   setlogon <username> <password>

   NOTE: The SETLOGON command is used on Pathworks 4.x and 5.x clients to provide
   share-level access by forwarding username and password with the connection
   request.

 - If you prefer to connect with Guest access, run SETLOGON from the
   STARTNET.BAT file and specify a username that is not in the Windows NT user
   account database. Ensure that the Guest account has been enabled and has
   access to the share.

 - If you want to define a list of shares for non-identified client computers to
   access edit the Registry:

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

   2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

    
         \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
    

   3. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value.

   4. Add the following:

      Value Name: NullSessionShares
      Data Type:  REG_MULTI_SZ
      String:     <name of share>
   

   5. Choose OK and quit Registry Editor.

   6. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
