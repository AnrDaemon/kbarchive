SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how Component Manager handles the upgrade process for The
Microsoft Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you sign in to The Microsoft Network, Component Manager determines whether
it needs to upgrade your computer's copy of The Microsoft Network software.

After The Microsoft Network verifies your password, your computer sends two
pieces of information to Component Manager: the version of your copy of The
Microsoft Network software, and the language version of your copy of Windows 95
(for example, English, Spanish, and so on).

Component Manager uses the language version to find the appropriate language tree
and search it for all the files that have a Component Manager version number
higher than your computer's version of The Microsoft Network. If there are no
such files, you do not need an upgrade and sign in is completed.

If you do need an upgrade, you are prompted to do so. You can accept or reject
the upgrade. If you reject it, you cannot sign on to The Microsoft Network. You
must upgrade if you want to use The Microsoft Network.

If you accept, the necessary files are downloaded to your computer, with a
progress dialog box advising you of the download status. When the download is
complete, another dialog box advises you that you must restart your computer to
complete the upgrade. You cannot connect to The Microsoft Network until after
you restart your computer.

The time estimate given for the upgrade reflects only the time needed to download
files, and does not include time needed to restart your computer (which varies
greatly depending on your computer's configuration).
