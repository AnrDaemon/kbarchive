TITLE   :RAS Auto Answer Fails with GVC FM144v Modem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Remote Access Service (RAS) Admin with the GVC FM144v modem
(also known as the F-1114 V/R6), RAS fails to set the modem to auto- answer mode
properly. This results in the GVC modem not responding to an incoming call, or
not handshaking even if it does pick up the call.

CAUSE
=====

The MODEM.INF file specifies the following initialization string:

      [GVC FM14400]
      COMMAND_INIT=AT&F&C1&D2Q0V1E1S0=0S2=128 S7=55 S95=44<cr>

The S95=44 command causes this problem. This command enables a set of result
messages for the event sequence when establishing an error- controlled
connection. It does not affect the way the modem negotiates a connection; it
only enables the message options.

NOTE: The "R6" in F-1114 V/R6 is a revision number for this modem. This revision
does not support the S95 register.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the S95=44 text from the [GVC FM14400] section of the MODEM.INF file
(located in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\RAS directory).
