NOTE: The immediately preceding set of permissions does not allow the user to run
NetSetup. If you want to allow a given user to run NetSetup (for SourceSafe
installation), make sure that you grant Execute permissions to that user in the
\VSS directory.

Although not recommended for performance reasons, if your SourceSafe Clients
intend to run the SourceSafe executables directly from the Network (that is,
they are not going to create a client installation on their local drives), then
modify the table above with the following changes:

   SourceSafe for         Rights Required
   32-bit Windows         for
   Directory              Network Access

   ---------------        --------------------------------------

   \VSS\WIN32             Read-But SourceSafe admins should have
                          full access

   SourceSafe for         Rights Required
   16-bit Windows         for
   Directory              Network Access
   ----------------       --------------------------------------

   \VSS\WIN               Read-But SourceSafe admins should have
                          full access

   \VSS\DOS               Read-But SourceSafe admins should have
                          full access

NOTE: In this scenario, all users will have access to the maintenance utilities
(ANALYZE, DDCONV etc.) located in these directories. These may be moved to an
alternate location if desired.
