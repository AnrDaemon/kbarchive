TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Use LOCAL Variables as Arrays
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Once a variable is declared as LOCAL, it cannot be used as an array. For
example, if the AFIELDS() function is used as follows, the error " <var>
is not an array" is displayed. However, if the PRIVATE keyword is used instead
of LOCAL, no error is generated. This is because PRIVATE does not declare
variables.

      LOCAL aFields1
      PRIVATE aFields2
      USE SYS(2004)+"\SAMPLES\DATA\CUSTOMER"
      n = AFIELDS(aFields1)
      n = AFIELDS(aFields2)

CAUSE
=====

The error "<var> is not an array" occurs bacause the variable has been
declared as a non array variable.

The PRIVATE and LOCAL commands perform different tasks. The PRIVATE command hides
memory variables. However, it does not create them. In the example shown above,
the AFIELDS() function created the array variable aFields(2), not the PRIVATE
command.

On the other hand, the LOCAL command, like the PUBLIC command, creates memory
variables and defines a scope for them. The LOCAL command is new to Visual
FoxPro. It creates memory variables and array memory variables that can be used
and modified only within the procedure or function in which they are created.
They cannot be accessed by higher or lower level programs.

For more information about the LOCAL command, search for LOCAL in the Visual
FoxPro Help menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use LOCAL ARRAY to declare an array memory variable. For example:

      LOCAL ARRAY aTest(3,2)

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
