SUMMARY
=======

If an OLE object is embedded (not linked) in a General field, you cannot control
the object directly by using OLE automation. Instead, you must first place the
object on a form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot use the CREATEOBJECT or GETOBJECT functions to create a reference to
an embedded OLE object in a General field. However, the field can be manipulated
if it is placed on a form. From a programming standpoint, if the form is never
made visible, the operation on the object is transparent to the user.

Code Sample
-----------

The following example creates a table that has a General field, places a
Microsoft Graph object in the first record, and then programatically adds a
title to the chart.

      * Create the table with the embedded object:
      CREATE TABLE grphaut(olegraph g)
      APPEND BLANK
      APPEND GENERAL olegraph CLASS "MSGraph"   && Appends default MSGraph
                                                && Data.

      * Use OLE automation to change the appearance of the chart:
      frmDummy =CREATEOBJECT("form")
      frmDummy.ADDOBJECT("oleGraph","OleBoundControl")
      WITH frmDummy.oleGraph
         .Height = 300
         .Width = 500
         .ControlSource = "grphaut.olegraph"
         .HasTitle = .T.
         .ChartTitle.Caption = "The Spanish Inquisition"
         .Type=3   && Type = 3 produces a bar chart, 4 produces a line chart
      ENDWITH
      RELEASE frmDummy

The actual OLE automation commands depend on the type of object stored in the
General field.
