SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to delete temporary (.Tmp) files in Windows 95/98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove temporary files, do the following:

1. Click the Start button and then click Shut Down. Click "Restart the Computer
   in MS-DOS Mode?" Click Yes.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER:

   " set " (without the quotation marks)

   Locate the Temp= line and note the location of the TEMP variable.

3. Change to the directory noted in step 2. For example, if TEMP is set to
   C:\Windows\Temp, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press
   ENTER:

   " cd\windows\temp " (without the quotation marks)

4. Delete any temporary files in this directory. Temporary files typically have
   a .Tmp extension. To delete these files, type the following, then press
   ENTER:

   " del *.tmp " (without the quotation marks)

5. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER to restart Windows
   95/98.

NOTE: You should never delete .Tmp files from within the Windows 95 graphical
user interface because Windows 95 or a Windows-based application may be using
one of these files.
