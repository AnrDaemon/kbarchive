======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A LAN Manager client, logged on to a LAN Manager domain, with a matching user ID
and password in a Windows NT domain, can connect to Windows NT servers providing
user validation (PDCs or BDCs), assuming the user ID has access privilege.

However, Windows NT servers not performing account validation (non- PDCs/BDCs)
cannot pass through validation for the client, even if a matching and valid
account and password exist for that client in the Windows NT Domain.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q103390 Network Access Validation Algorithm and Example

WORKAROUND
==========

Have the LAN Manager client log on to the Windows NT domain where they already
have an existing account.

-or-

Allow the Everyone group on the Windows NT Server to have access to the share.

-or-

Create an account on the local Windows NT Server for the LAN Manager user. Make
sure the user ID and password match the LAN Manager user ID and password.
