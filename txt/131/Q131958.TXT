SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on as an Account Operator using User Manager for Domains on a
computer running Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or Windows 95 the
following message appears when you attempt to create or change the password of
any user in the Windows NT domain:

   Administrative Password Verification

   The operation you have initiated requires an
   administrative password for the server listed
   below. Please enter that password now.

   Server Name: <Servername>
   Password: <Enter password>

After you enter the administrative password for the server, the following error
message appears:

   Access is denied.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the user's password restriction of Minimum Password Age
is set to Allow Changes in x Days, where x represents any number of days (limit
of 999). By default, the Minimum Password Age for any user is set to Allow
Changes Immediately.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Log on as one of the Windows NT domain administrators.

2. In User Manager for Domains, select the user.

3. From the Policies menu, choose Account.

4. For Minimum Password Age, choose Allow Changes Immediately.
