======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 95 The Complete Interactive Multimedia Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
 - Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Encarta, screen colors may appear faded or washed out.

CAUSE
=====

The monitor color setting may be set for 16 colors. For best color display, the
monitor should be set for at least 256 colors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore Encarta colors, reset your display setting to 256 colors using the
following steps:

1. From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels.

2. Choose Monitors.

3. Be sure the monitor setting is set for at least 256 colors.

4. Close the Control Panel and return to Encarta.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Encarta changes the monitor setting to 16 colors to play the animation
correctly. If you quit Encarta while an Animation is playing, it will remain on
this setting. It also remains in 16 colors if you quit from Animation Launcher
while an animation is playing.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Encarta 1995. Encarta
Encyclopedia 1996 and 1997 require 256 colors to start.
