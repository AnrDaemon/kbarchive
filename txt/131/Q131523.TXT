======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Mail for Windows user can select the option to receive a return
receipt message. Normally, this will generate a return receipt message in the
form of a postcard that displays the date and time the message was opened by the
recipient. However, in certain cases a standard message will be generated.

CAUSE
=====

When the receiving client is MS-DOS workstation, the sender will receive a
message with a body such as the following:

    [013]             ***** Read receipt from a registered message *****
 
   Your message:
 
   To:    Administrator                                   Date: 04-26-95
   Subject:     Test message                              Time: 7:49
 
                        Was read 04-26-95 17:49

When the user reads the message using Mail for Windows in a different language
version (for example, the French version), the sender will receive a text only
message with a body such as the following:

   Microsoft Mail v3.0 IPM.Microsoft Mail.Read Receipt
