 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95 with a Banyan Vines network, you may receive the
following error message:

   Vines NDIS Interface error: 1021. See NDISBAN.DOC for an error description.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the correct "Bindings=" setting is not used in the
PROTOCOL.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the Banyan Vines PCCONFIG.EXE configuration
utility. For information about using this utility, please refer to your Banyan
Vines documentation, or contact your network administrator or Banyan Vines
Technical Support.

Using PCCONFIG.EXE, modify this setting:

   PROTOCOL.INI BINDINGS=

Change the setting to the same value in the "Bindings=<xxxx>" line in the
PROTOCOL.INI file, where <xxxx> is the internal name of the network
adapter driver.

For example, if you are using an Intel EtherExpress network adapter, the
PROTOCOL.INI file contains this entry:

   Bindings=EXP16$

In this example, the internal name of the network adapter driver is EXP16$.
