KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows 95 screen saver activates, the Microsoft Office Manager toolbar
may remain visible.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only if the following conditions are met:

 - You are running a 16-bit version of Office Manager and a 32-bit screen saver.

 - You have selected the Always On Top option in Office Manager.

 - The Office Manager toolbar had the focus when the screen saver activated.

When Office Manager loses focus, it automatically puts itself on top. In Windows
version 3.x, with cooperative multitasking, Office Manager does not lose the
focus when a screen saver activates. In Windows 95, with pre- emptive
multitasking, Office Manager does lose the focus when a 32-bit screen saver
activates. When Windows 95 gives Office Manager control again, it puts itself on
top.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
