SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a default program information file (PIF)
for MS-DOS-based programs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A default PIF file for MS-DOS-based programs is used for those MS-DOS-based
programs that are not shipped with their own PIF files, and are started by
clicking Run on the Start menu. To create a default PIF file for MS-DOS- based
programs, follow these steps:

1. Open the Windows folder.

2. On the File menu, point to New, then click Shortcut.

3. In the Command Line box, type "command.com" (without the quotation marks) ,
   then click Next.

4. In the "Select a name for the shortcut" box, type "_DEFAULT" (without the
   quotation marks) , then click Finish.

5. Use the right mouse button to click the new _DEFAULT.PIF file, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

6. Set the properties you want for the _DEFAULT.PIF file, then click OK.

7. Restart Windows 95.
