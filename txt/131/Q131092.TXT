PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SourceSafe keyword expansion is case sensitive. For example, the following do
not expand as expected:

         $nokeywords: $

         $Nokeywords: $

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

The syntax for the keywords is:

         $Archive: $
         $Author: $
         $Date: $
         $Header: $
         $History: $
         $Log: $
         $Logfile: $
         $Modtime: $
         $NoKeywords: $
         $Revision: $
         $Workfile: $

Visual SourceSafe 6.0 also contains:

         $JustDate: $

The capital letters are required.
