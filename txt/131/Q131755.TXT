The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft 500 Nations for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to tell 500 Nations version 1.0 from version 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To differentiate between 500 Nations versions 1.0 and 1.0a, check the part
number printed on a white sticker on the back of the CD-ROM jewel case.

Version 1.0 CD-ROM part number:

   317-052-001               CD-ROM SET WIN/500 NATIONS 1.00

Version 1.0a CD-ROM part number:

   317-052-003               CD-ROM SET WIN/500 NATIONS 1.00(A)

Additionally, you can use the number on the actual compact disc to determine the
version:

Version    Number
-------    ------

1.        cdrm-1296370   1
1.0a      cdrm-1296370   3

Version 1.0a of 500 Nations addresses read problems with some 3x and 4x drives
that are unable to read or copy the Wingde.dll file on the version 1.0 CD. This
read/copy problem in version 1.0 causes the computer to stop responding (hang)
when the introductory Microsoft Home screen displays. The 500 Nations CD has
been re-mastered in version 1.0a to allow better file access with all CD drives.
