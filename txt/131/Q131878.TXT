TITLE   :Microsoft Exchange Client Keeps Unsent Mail in Outbox
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you quit Microsoft Exchange with unsent mail in the Outbox, you receive the
following message:

   There is still unsent mail in the Outbox. You may want to send it the
   next time you use Microsoft Exchange.

This behavior is not the same as in previous versions of Microsoft Mail products.
Previous versions offer you the option of sending unsent mail in the Outbox
before the program closes.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange does not offer an option to send unsent mail when you quit
the program because of the complexity of simultaneous, multiple service
providers. This avoids the possible launch of asynchronous dial-up sessions with
service providers during exit.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can force mail in the Outbox to be sent before you quit Microsoft Exchange
by clicking Deliver Mail Now on the Tools menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you click Save on the File menu, or if you reopen the message and then close
it, the message becomes inactive. You need to open the message and send it
again.
