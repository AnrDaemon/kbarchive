SUMMARY
=======

HyperTerminal connectoid (.HT) files may vary in size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HyperTerminal connectoids are files that store settings for individual
HyperTerminal connections. Connectoids contain the backscroll buffer from the
last time the connection was used. Because the size of the backscroll buffer can
vary, the size of the connectoids can vary. The default size of the backscroll
buffer is 500 lines. To change the size of the backscroll buffer for a
connectoid, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the connectoid you want to change, then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the Settings tab.

3. In the Backscroll Buffer Lines box, enter the number of lines you want for
   the backscroll buffer.

4. Click OK.

When you open a HyperTerminal connectoid, you can display the contents of the
backscroll buffer by moving the scroll box. The information in the backscroll
buffer includes information from all the previous sessions that fits in the
defined buffer size.
