TITLE   :Record Pointer Moves in BROWSE as Records Are Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a record is marked for deletion in a BROWSE by clicking the delete marker,
the record pointer moves to that record.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is new to Visual FoxPro. In previous versions of FoxPro, the
record pointer doesn't move when the delete marker for a record is selected.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Pick a table and open it with the USE command:

      USE <any table>

2. Use the BROWSE command to browse the table.

3. While the record pointer is on record #1, click the delete marker for record
   number 2 - but don't select record number 2, just click the delete marker for
   record number 2.

4. In the Command window, type "? RECNO()" (without the quotation marks) to see
   that the record pointer has moved to record 2. In earlier versions of FoxPro,
   the record pointer remains at record 1.
