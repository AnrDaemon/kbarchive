TITLE   :ACC: Cannot Reference OLE Control in Datasheet View
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,7.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access 2.0 
 - Microsoft Access for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.


SYMPTOMS
========

When you reference a form's OLE control in an expression or a procedure, you may
receive the following error message.

In Microsoft Access 97
----------------------

   Run-time error '2771': The bound or unbound object frame you tried to edit
   doesn't contain an OLE object.

   Use the Object command on the Insert menu to add an OLE object to the bound or
   unbound object frame.

In Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0
----------------------------------------------

   The unbound or bound object frame you tried to edit doesn't contain an OLE
   object.

In Microsoft Access version 2.0
-------------------------------

   Can't obtain this property setting. The property may not be available in this
   view, or an error may have occurred.

CAUSE
=====

When a form is open in Datasheet view, you cannot reference the form's unbound
OLE control.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not reference OLE controls in forms that are displayed in Datasheet view.

NOTE: You can check a form's CurrentView property setting to determine whether
the form is displayed in Datasheet, Form, or Design view.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 2.0, 7.0, and
97. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new form not based on a table or query.

2. Insert the Calendar Control.

3. In the Properties dialog box, change the name of the Calendar Control to
   "CalendarCtl" (without the quotation marks).

4. View the form in Datasheet view

5. Open the Debug window (or Immediate window in version 2.0), and type the
   following line:

   ? Forms!Form1!CalendarCtl.object.value

   Note that you receive an error message because the form that the expression
   references is open in Datasheet view.
