KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to start Scenes when your computer has low memory or limited
available system resources, you receive the following error message:

   More memory is needed to run transition effects

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, try the following:

 - Close other programs you are running and restart Scenes.

   NOTE: You must close and restart Scenes to enable the program to recover from
   the error.

 - If you are using Windows 3.1, make sure the system is running with a swapfile
   (virtual memory). You can check the swapfile settings in the Control Panel by
   clicking the Enhanced icon.

   For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your
   Windows printed documentation or online Help.

 - Upgrade to Windows 95. Windows 95 does not suffer from resource limitations
   like Windows 3.x did.
