WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested
by Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been taken

PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this
information "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing three or more consecutive REPORT FORM commands causes a "Printer Not
Ready" error to occur.

CAUSE
=====

PCAnywhere by Symantec adds the following lines to the SYSTEM.INI file:

      [386 Enhanced]
      timercriticalsection=500
      device=awdos.386
      device=vpcaw.386
      device=symevnt.386

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the lines added by PCAnywhere.

If the error persists, try changing the default printer driver or adding a few
seconds of delay between each REPORT FORM command by using a FOR .. NEXT loop.
If a different printer driver eliminates the error, obtain the latest version of
the default printer driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install PCAnywhere, it modifies the Windows SYSTEM.INI file and adds a
few device drivers to handle the display as well as the COM and LPT ports.
FoxPro for Windows may give you a 'Printer Not Ready' error message when the
REPORT FORM is issued three or more consecutive times. Uninstall PCAnywhere to
resolve this error. Depending on the version of PCAnywhere, drivers other than
what is listed above may exist in the INI file(s). For a complete listing of
changes done to the SYSTEM.INI or WIN.INI file, consult with Symantec or check
your documentation.

PCAnywhere is manufactured by Symantec, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.

Please note that the communication port architecture in version 3.1 of Windows
and Windows for Workgroups was changed in Windows for Workgroup version 3.11.
