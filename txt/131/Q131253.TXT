TITLE   :PRB: Right Mouse Functions Incorrectly w/ IntelliPoint Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro for Windows, a right mouse click displays a context- sensitive
short-cut menu for that specific function or area. If the secondary button
option of the IntelliPoint software's Button tab is enabled, the Visual FoxPro
context-sensitive short-cut menu items are disabled when a right mouse click is
executed.

CAUSE
=====

The settings in the IntelliPoint driver (Version 1.1) override the settings
specific to an application.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable the right mouse button functions of Visual FoxPro, the setting for the
Secondary button must be set to Unassigned.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Access the IntelliPoint Mouse driver settings by choosing Mouse from the
   Control Panel, or by clicking the 'IntelliPoint Tools & Controls' icon in
   the 'Microsoft Input Devices' group.

2. On the Buttons page, assign the Seconday button to Help.

3. Observe that in Visual FoxPro, clicking the right mouse button now displays
   the Help topics rather than the appropriate task list available for that
   particular Visual FoxPro feature.
