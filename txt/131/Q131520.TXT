TITLE   :Err Msg "The Mailbox Name or Password Is Incorrect" in Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you clear the Remember Password check box in the Microsoft Mail logon
dialog box in Windows for Workgroups and then change your Microsoft Mail
password, the next time you log on you receive the following error message:

   The mailbox name or password is incorrect.

Note that this description assumes that you have previously selected the Remember
Password check box and then logged on to Microsoft Mail.

CAUSE
=====

When you start Microsoft Mail, it looks for a cached password. If Microsoft Mail
finds a cached password, it tries to use that password.

Clearing the Remember Password check box does not remove a previously cached
password, but prevents your new password from being cached. In the situation
described in the "Symptoms" section, the last cached password is different from
your current password, but is used when you try to log in.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this error, use either of the following methods:

 - Remove or rename the <username>.PWL file in the Windows directory, then
   restart Microsoft Mail and enter your new password. If you want the new
   password cached, select the Remember Password check box.

   NOTE: This method removes all cached passwords.

   NOTE: If you are using a personal certificate, you should export it before
   renaming your .pwl file. If you do not do so, it may be unavailable when you
   send e-mail. For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   Q190296 Unable to Use Personal Certificates in Outlook Express

 - Use the password list editor (PWLEDIT.EXE) available on the Utilities disk
   included with the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit to delete the
   cached password.
