======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run a form containing an OleBoundControl object and the TYPE() function
attempts to verify the type of an undefined property of the object, the TYPE()
function returns an empty string ("") instead of the expected "U" value.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your application uses the return value of the TYPE() function, test for an
empty value ("") as a return value for all cases where an object uses the
OleBoundControl as a BaseClass. For example:

   DO CASE
      CASE <object>.BaseClass="Oleboundcontrol"
         IF TYPE('<form>.<object>.UndefProp')="U" ;
            OR TYPE ('<form>.<object>.UndefProp')=""
            *Place code here
         ELSE
            *Place code here
         ENDIF
   ENDCASE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. On the DataEnvironment menu, click Add Table.

3. In the Add Table dialog box, select Tables, and then select the Employee
   table located in the SAMPLES\DATA directory.

4. Click the OleBoundControl control on the Form Controls toolbar, and place the
   control on the form. Then modify the ControlSource property of the control to
   this:

      ControlSource: Employee.Photo

5. Place a command button on the form, and modify its Click event handler to
   include this code:

      SKIP
      Thisform.Refresh

6. Save the form as FRMTEST, and run it.

7. Use the following code in the Debug window (for Visual FoxPro 3.x versions)
   or the Watch window in the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Debugger to verify the return
   value of the OleBoundControl control:

      TYPE('Frmtest.OleBoundControl1.BadProp') && Property does not exist
