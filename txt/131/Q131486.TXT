OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enter a task with no end date, the task will not be included in the
task list if you use the Upcoming filter.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Upcoming tasks are those tasks that haven't been started. Active tasks are those
that have been started, but haven't been finished. Tasks that do not have an end
date are considered started. Thus, if a task has no end date, it is identified
as Active; if it does have an end date, it is identified as Upcoming.

Upcoming is not a subset of active for the reasons mentioned above.


Additional query words: schedule plus 7.00
