SUMMARY
=======

When you share a printer in Windows NT, the spooler creates a thread that
broadcasts a message on all of the print server's installed protocols to all
Windows NT print servers, informing the print servers of the new print share.
Each of these print servers adds the new print share name to its local printer
browse list. In addition, each print server rebroadcasts the list of its local
printers to all print servers every 10 minutes. Although this design ensures
that all Windows NT print servers have current browse lists, it can also causes
extensive network traffic.

The procedure below explains how to disable the printer browse thread. Disabling
the thread reduces network traffic, but also keeps the print servers from
knowing about new print shares.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable the printer browse thread, modify the Registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print

3. From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

4. Add the following to disable the printer browse thread:

   Value Name: DisableServerThread
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD
   String:     1

5. Choose OK and quit Registry Editor.

6. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
