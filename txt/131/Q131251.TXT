SUMMARY
=======

PowerPoint does not have an AutoNumbering feature. To create a numbered list,
you must manually type a number at the beginning of each paragraph.

You can also "borrow" the AutoNumbering feature from Microsoft Word. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. In PowerPoint, add an additional blank line at the end of the bulleted text
   range.

2. Select the range of bulleted items, including the blank line.

3. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

4. Switch to Word.

5. In a new document, click Paste on the Edit menu.

6. Reselect the text, if necessary.

7. Click the Bullets button on the Formatting toolbar to turn bullets off.

8. Select each bullet separately and click the Numbering button on the toolbar
   to turn numbering on.

9. After all bullets have numbers, select the list, and click Copy on the Edit
   menu.

10. Switch to PowerPoint. Make sure the original text object is still selected.

11. Turn bullets off by clicking the Bullet On/Off button on the toolbar.

12. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

The text will paste with the numbering.
