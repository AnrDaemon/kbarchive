-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears when you run Microsoft Mail and choose
Postoffice Manager from the Mail menu.

   The postoffice is already being managed by. Try again later.

CAUSE
=====

The Mail Postoffice Manager attempts to open FLAG.GLB for exclusive access
before displaying the Postoffice Manager window to determine if the postoffice
is already being managed. Any one of the following conditions can cause the
error noted above:

 - Another Mail user has already opened this file for exclusive access by
   running another instance of the Postoffice Administrator, or is in the
   process of creating a new account on the workgroup postoffice as part of the
   Mail initialization procedure.

 - You do not have the appropriate file permissions to open the FLAG.GLB file.
   The workgroup postoffice is on an Windows NT file system (NTFS) partition and
   you do not have the appropriate permissions to open FLAG.GLB file. All
   Microsoft Mail users must have Full Control permission to the workgroup
   postoffice directory (WGPO by default) and all of its subdirectories and
   files.

 - The read-only file attribute is set on FLAG.GLB.

 - FLAG.GLB is locked by the workgroup postoffice server, because there is
   another exclusive open request against this file that has not yet been
   closed.

RESOLUTION
