SUMMARY
=======

When you use an S3-864 video adapter with a hardware device, such as an IBM
Token Ring 16/4 ISA network interface card (NIC), the NIC may fail and the
following event log appears in the system log:

   Event ID: 5012
   Source: Ibmtok01
   Type: Error
   Description: The I/O base address supplied does not match the jumpers
   on the adapter.

CAUSE
=====

The S3 video adapter is attempting to use the same address range as the hardware
device. For example, by default, the S3 video adapter with the 864 chipset uses
the RAM address range of C000 to CFFF. The IBM TokenRing 16/4 ISA NIC uses the
address range of CC00 to CDFF, by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change the RAM address of the hardware device to
another address range, such as DC00.
