TITLE   :FIX: Access Violation with Large NAMELIST
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbFL32 kbFortranPSkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application that uses a large NAMELIST may cause an access violation when
attempting to write the NAMELIST. This problem is seen most often with NAMELISTs
around 2K in size, but the problem has been known to occur with a NAMELIST as
small as 100 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, reduce the size of the NAMELIST. This can be
accomplished by either splitting the NAMELIST into multiple smaller NAMELISTs or
by grouping variables of similar type together in an array.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in FORTRAN PowerStation
32, version 4.0.

         DO Index = 1,100
             TheArray(Index) = "Testing NAMELIST"
         END DO

   C  Display the name list
         WRITE (*,TheNameList)

         END
