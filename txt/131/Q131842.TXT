TITLE   :Error Code Not Displayed When MAP Command Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The logon script processor that is installed with the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks displays an error message when an error occurs processing a MAP
command, but does not display an error code.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the logon script processor user interface does not display the error
code when a MAP command fails, an error code is generated. Therefore, this
problem does not affect "IF ERRORLEVEL" statements or other commands that rely
on error codes.
