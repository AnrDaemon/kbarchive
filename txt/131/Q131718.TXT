======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The CD-ROM optimization settings are available in the File System Properties
dialog box even if there is no CD-ROM drive installed. When you change these
settings, Windows 95 prompts you to restart the computer.

If there is no CD-ROM drive installed, the CD-ROM file system driver (CDFS.VXD)
does not remain in memory at startup and the CD-ROM optimization settings are
not active. Changing these settings on a computer that does not have a CD-ROM
drive installed does not affect the performance of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the CD-ROM optimization settings on a computer that does have a CD-ROM
drive installed, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click Properties on the
   menu that appears.

2. Click the Performance tab.

3. Click the File System button.
