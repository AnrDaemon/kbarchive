TITLE   :PRB: CONFIG.FPW w/ Multiple COMMAND= Lines Runs Only Last One
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a CONFIG.FPW file contains multiple COMMAND= statements, only the last
COMMAND= statement is processed.

CAUSE
=====

Both FoxPro version 2.x and Visual FoxPro process only a single COMMAND= line.
The last COMMAND= line is the only one processed.

WORKAROUND
==========

If it is necessary to have multiple commands execute, revise the COMMAND=
statement to call a program (.PRG file) instead of trying to execute each
desired command with a separate COMMAND= line.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In the following example, the commands issued in CONFIG.FPW attempt to set the
code page and then display the results of that command. Because only one
COMMAND= is allowed, the SET CPCOMPILE is not executed.

Contents of CONFIG.FPW:

   codepage = auto
   COMMAND = SET CPCOMPILE to 437
   COMMAND = ?set("cpcompile")

To get this to work as intended, revise the CONFIG.FPW to read as follows:

   codepage=auto
   COMMAND=DO Setup.prg
