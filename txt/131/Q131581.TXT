TITLE   :Aborted File Transfer Deletes File on Remote Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are copying a file over the network to a directory containing a file
with the same name, if the file transfer process is canceled or fails, the file
being replaced is deleted.

This behavior also occurs when you are using Dial-Up Networking.

CAUSE
=====

During the file transfer process, the destination file (the file that is to be
replaced) is deleted after you confirm that you want to replace a file. If the
file transfer process is canceled or fails, the deleted destination file cannot
be restored. The file is not moved to the Recycle Bin and cannot be recovered.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the file transfer process is canceled or fails, repeat the transfer.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Recycle Bin tracks only files deleted locally using Windows Explorer, My
Computer, or a Windows 95-compatible shell program.

A file that is deleted as part of a file transfer process between two computers
is not moved to the Recycle Bin.
