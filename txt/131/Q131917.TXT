-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, and you have a
large mail message file (MMF), the program may terminate with a message
indicating that there is not enough free hard drive space available.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following alternatives may be used:

Method 1
--------

 - Export mail from the MMF to an export file. (This will move mail out of the
   MMF and into an export file that may reside on another drive.)

 - Rename the old MMF, then create a new one.

 - Import mail back into the new MMF.

Method 2
--------

   Compress the MMF (Hold the F5 key down when you launch Mail). This may reduce
   the MMF to a more manageable size.

Method 3
--------

   Delete unnecessary mail to reduce the size of the MMF file.
