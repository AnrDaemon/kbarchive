TITLE   :PRB: CLEAR ALL in Cleanup Code of FoxPro 2.6 Form Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If in Visual FoxPro, you execute a FoxPro version 2.6 screen that has a CLEAR
ALL command in the Cleanup code, the following error message appears:

   Cannot clear the object in use.

CAUSE
=====

As stated in the Visual FoxPro Help file topic for the CLEAR command:

CLEAR ALL within an event or method for an active control or object generates a
Visual FoxPro error message. An object type memory variable cannot be released
from memory when its associated control or object is active.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

In FoxPro version 2.6, CLEAR ALL releases everything from memory except system
memory variables.

In Visual FoxPro version 3.0, CLEAR ALL releases everything from memory except
system memory variables and objects currently in use.
