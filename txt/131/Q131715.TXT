SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up a Windows NT Server to act as a Domain Time
Source server and enable client computers to synchronize with it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Network administrators may establish one or more Windows NT timesource servers
as domain time standards and modify client login scripts to synchronize
workstation time to the timesource servers. Network environments that require
high accuracy may install the TIMESERV utility (included in the Windows NT
Resource Kit). This utility synchronizes a Windows NT computer to a remote time
standard through modem dial-up. For more information about TIMESERV, refer to
the Windows NT Resource Kit Help file (RKTOOLS.HLP).

Setting Up Windows NT Server as a Domain Time Source Server
-----------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and locate the following Registry
   subkey:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
         \LanManServer\Parameters
  

2. From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

3. Add the following:

      Value Name: TimeSource
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      String: 1
  

4. Choose OK and quit the Registry Editor.

5. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

Enabling Client Computers to Synchronize with Domain Time Source Server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For Windows NT client computers, type the following in the MS-DOS Command Prompt
or add the following to the login script:

   NET TIME /DOMAIN:<domain name> /SET

For Windows or MS-DOS based client computers, such as Windows, Windows for
Workgroups, LAN Manager for MS-DOS or Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, type
the following in the MS-DOS command prompt or add the following to the login
script:

   NET TIME /WORKGROUP:<domain name> /SET

NOTE: You can also synchronize all timesource computers with a master timesource
computer using the command: NET TIME \\<computername> /SET. The master
timesource computer can also be synchronized to an external time standard using
the TIMESERV utility.
