TITLE   :How to Display Current Control Properties at Run Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

While the property sheet is available for controls during design time, Visual
FoxPro does not provide a direct way to display the current values of an active
control during run time. You can place a maximum of sixteen entries in the Debug
Window, but this has limited application.

Insert the code listed in this article in an appropriate method to display a list
of the current properties and their values in a scrollable window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For the following code sample to function as intended, the following conditions
must be true:

 - The WindowState must be normal (0).

 - The form and control must be active and visible.

 - No other instances of the form can be running.

Insert the following code sample into a method (such as Click or
InteractiveChange) that can be called interactively to determine the current
state of the control's properties.

When you run the code, the currently active form is minimized and the property
list window activated. Once the desired status is determined, close the property
list window to return the form to its normal state.

Code Sample
-----------

   * Property list display code
   LOCAL lnCnt
   lnCnt=AMEMBERS(paTmp,THIS)    && Store properties in private array Tmp
   SET SAFETY OFF
   SET TEXTMERGE TO objsho
   SET SAFETY ON
   SET TEXTMERGE ON NOSHOW
   THISFORM.WINDOWSTATE=1
   FOR nI = 1 TO lnCnt
       \\<<paTmp[nI] + ' = '>>
       \\<<EVALUATE( 'THIS.' + paTmp[nI] )>>
       \ 
   ENDFOR
   SET TEXTMERGE OFF
   SET TEXTMERGE TO
