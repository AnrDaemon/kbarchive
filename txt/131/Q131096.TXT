TITLE   :Workgroup Name and Domain Name Same for Browsing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.11,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 Installation Guide incorrectly states
the following on page 56:

   Browsing will not be available if you log on to a Windows for Workgroups
   computer whose workgroup name is the same as the name of a Windows NT
   domain....

RESOLUTION
==========

If you change the workgroup name of your Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client to
the same name as a Windows NT domain that you are connected to, you are still
able to browse. This is often the recommend configuration for troubleshooting.
However if you do this, the workgroup machine will not become a browse master
since it will always lose the browse master elections to the computers on the
domain running Windows NT.

Additional query words: documentation error 3.11 prodnt browsemaster
