TITLE   :PC NTMMTA: Maximum Number of Instances Running as a Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA) running as a
Service is limited to seven instances per machine. This limit is related to the
number of drive letters available on the machine. Each instance of the NT MMTA
takes three drive letters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.5 of the Microsoft
Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a machine that has drives A: through E: reserved for other devices (for
example, floppy disk drives, CD ROMs, etc.), there are 21 drives left. The
following are examples of uses for these drives:

   Instance        1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   Home Drive      f   i   l   o   r   u   x
   Dynamic Drives  gh  jk  mn  pq  st  vw  yz

Two dynamic drives are used; one for sending mail, and one for receiving mail.
This is the same as the DynamicDrives option in the MS-DOS and OS/2 versions of
the External program.

NOTE: When you use a single postoffice instance, it will map only one drive.
