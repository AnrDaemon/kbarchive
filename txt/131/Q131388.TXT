The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When your application accesses a PostScript printer driver, such as a Print
Preview, the following STOP Message appears:

   STOP c000021a {Fatal System Error}

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT PostScript printer driver parses PostScript Printer Description
(PPD) files and overwrites system memory if it encounters an invocation string
in the PPD that is longer than 512 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no resolution at this time. Note that PPD files with invocation strings
longer than 512 bytes are rare. Windows NT does not supply PPD files with
invocation strings longer than 512 bytes.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.
This problem has been corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
