The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or Windows 95 client initiates a session
between the client and a server (for example, you run NET USE) from a login
script, the connection may fail.

CAUSE
=====

The connection fails because the domain name is not passed to the server in the
Session Setup&X SMB. Without a domain name in the Session Setup&X SMB,
the server checks to see if the user name exists in the local SAM database. If
found, the user's password is compared to the one in local SAM database. If the
user's name is not present in the server SAM database, the server sends
pass-through authentication requests to each domain being trusted. The first one
that responds is used to authenticate the user. If the password for the account
doesn't match, the user is prompted for the password.

This can cause problems when your network environment requires users to have
duplicate accounts in multiple domains.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually keep the passwords in each domain
synchronized for users requiring multiple accounts.

Once the user is logged in and the logon script has completed, any subsequent
commands that initiate a session between the client and a server are sent with
the domain name. Therefore, the problem should not occur when you attempt to
initiates a session again.
