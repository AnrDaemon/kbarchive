KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA),
and you use a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to the home postoffice (for
example, \\SERVER\VOL\PATH), the option to overwrite the default EXTERNAL.INI
file in the \MAILDATA\INI subdirectory will give the following error:

   Setup Message: Could not create directory \\server\vol\ini\external.ini

RESOLUTION
==========

When Setup prompts for the EXTERNAL.INI file to be overwritten, select Do Not
Overwrite. This will prevent Setup from overwriting the EXTERNAL.INI file in the
\MAILDATA\INI subdirectory for the home postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.5 of the Microsoft
Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
