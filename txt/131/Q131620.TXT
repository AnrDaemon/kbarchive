PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0; Win95:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you export a Schedule+ file and choose the Save File As Type option from
the browser, the filename extension remains .SC2, rather than changing to the
file type chosen, such as *.SCH, *.TXT, or *.*.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

When you export a Schedule+ file, the default export name is the user ID with the
extension .SC2; for example, USERID.SC2.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you choose the Save File As Type option with the default filename in the
filename box, you must modify the extension manually.


Additional query words: schedule plus 7.00
