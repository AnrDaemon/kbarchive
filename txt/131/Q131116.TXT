======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a mail message on one postoffice to a new user on another
postoffice, the mail message is returned with the following error:

   [002] Mail was received that was addressed to unknown address

This error occurs when you address the mail from either the Global Address List
(GAL) or the Network List.

CAUSE
=====

The problem may be due to mail being sent to a new external user before the
External program has a chance to poll the postoffice for address list and
network information updates.

RESOLUTION
==========

Adjust the IntervalUpdate parameter in the EXTERNAL.INI or command line:

1. Wait for the IntervalUpdate period to expire and try again. The default is
   five minutes; however, another period may be specified on the command line or
   the EXTERNAL.INI file.

2. Verify that the IntervalUpdate period is not set to zero. This will prevent
   updates from occurring. If this parameter is necessary, then follow step 3.

3. Exit and restart the External program. This will force External to reload the
   network lists into memory.
