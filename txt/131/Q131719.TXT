SUMMARY
=======

When you are using Media Player to play an audio CD and you restart your
computer, the CD continues to play until the CONFIG.SYS file is processed as the
computer restarts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is the same behavior that occurs when you are using CD Player to play an
audio CD and the Stop CD Playing On Exit option is disabled. If you want audio
CDs to stop playing when you restart Windows 95, use CD Player and enable the
Stop CD Playing On Exit option. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   Multimedia, then click CD Player.

2. On the Options menu, click Preferences.

3. Click the Stop CD Playing On Exit check box to select it.
