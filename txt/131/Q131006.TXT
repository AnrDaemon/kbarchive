 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Dr. Watson won't log stack information in postmortem debug log if the
application was built with the Visual C++, versions 2.x and later, default
settings.

CAUSE
=====

Dr. Watson can be configured to log debug information into a log file when an
unhandled user mode exception occurs. For more information about this please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q121434 Specifying the Debugger for Unhandled User Mode Exceptions


With applications built with Visual C++ version 1.0, the stack information
includes the symbol information for the functions on the stack frame. With
applications built with Visual C++ versions 2.x and later this information is no
longer included. This results in an incomplete log.

This is because Dr. Watson requires that symbol information be in COFF format. By
default, the Visual C++ version 1.0 link build options included both COFF and
Microsoft Format debug symbols. However, with Visual C++ versions 2.x and later,
this has changed; only Microsoft Format style symbols are included.

RESOLUTION
==========

To build the application with the required symbols for Dr. Watson, the build
parameters must be changed for the project. Use the following steps from within
the Visual C++ integrated development environment:

1. Load the desired project.

2. For Visual C++ version 4.0, choose Settings... from the Build menu.

   For Visual C++ version 2.x, choose Settings from the Project menu.

3. Select the Link tab.

4. Select Debug from the Category list box.

5. Select the "Generate Debug Info" check box.

6. Select the "Both Formats" option to include COFF and Microsoft Format
   symbols.

7. Rebuild the application.
