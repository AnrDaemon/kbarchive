The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the mouse to create an appointment in the Planner view that lasts
longer than 24 hours, the appointment only lasts until 11:59 P.M. of the start
date of the appointment. This problem occurs if you have only one day displayed
in the Daily view.

CAUSE
=====

When a single day is displayed in the Daily view, appointments created by using
the mouse can only last from 00:00 to 24:00 of the day that is displayed.

This is by product design.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Planner view:

 - Select the time for the appointment, click the right mouse button, and then
   select New Appointment.

   -or-

 - Select the time and click Appointment on the Insert menu.

In the Daily view:

On the View menu, click Number of Days. Choose the number of days the appointment
is to span. Then switch to the Planner view and create the appointment.
