Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download VMGA.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "vmga"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

   NOVELL.EXE (284,338 bytes, dated 03-07-95, 4:45 P.M.)
   DCA_CUT.EXE (289,218 bytes, dated 03-07-95, 4:44 P.M.)
   DCA_DFT.EXE (306,690 bytes, dated 03-07-95, 4:43 P.M.)
   IBM_HIGH.EXE (290,114 bytes, dated 03-07-95, 4:42 P.M.)

To update your VMGATE.EXE file
------------------------------

Decide which executable file matches your configuration:

Executable file   3270 emulation card supported
-----------------------------------------------

   NOVELL.EXE Novell NetWare 3270
   DCA_CUT.EXE DCA CUT-mode
   DCA_DFT.EXE DCA Non-CUT (DFT) mode
   IBM_HIGH.EXE IBM High Level

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <path>:\VMGA.exe <destination>\vmgate.exe

   where <path> is the drive and directory where you ran the self
   extracting " (without the quotation marks)

VMGA.EXE file, <destination> is the drive and directory where your
VMGATE.EXE file currently resides, and VMGA is the corresponding executable file
for your software vendor. For example, if you ran the self extracting file from
the TEST directory on drive D, your VMGATE.EXE file is located in the MAILEXE
directory on drive C, and you are using IBM High Level, type the following
command and press ENTER:

   " copy d:\test\IBM_HIGH.EXE c:\mailexe\vmgate.exe " (without the quotation
   marks)
