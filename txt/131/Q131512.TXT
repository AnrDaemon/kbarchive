-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete a mailbox with shared folders or groups from the Mail
Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE) for Mail for PC Networks, the Administrator
account that deleted the mailbox will become the owner of the shared folders or
groups and has rights to delete the shared folders or groups with his or her
Mail client.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using IMPORT.EXE, and you delete the users using the -a option, or if
there is possible folder file corruption, then this will not work.

To determine the folder owner and type (public, private, or shared), run the
ADMIN.EXE program, and select Local-Admin, Folders, Print, and either Printer or
File.
