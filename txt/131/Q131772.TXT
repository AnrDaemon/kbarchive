SUMMARY
=======

By setting Compare to Checksum, you can increase the speed of the Get command.
This may, however, provide unexpected results unless you are aware of the way
SourceSafe compares the checksum.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SourceSafe computes the checksum with the Update command. For the sake of
efficiency, if Compare is not set to Checksum, SourceSafe doesn't compute the
checksum value. As a result, when you first set Compare equal to Checksum, the
checksum value is not available for comparison. When you use the Get command,
SourceSafe continues to get the files until they are Updated. To resolve this
issue, update the files immediately after setting Compare to Checksum.

NOTE: Because the checksum is computed on each update, all SourceSafe users
should set Compare equal to Checksum if one user does.

For more information on how to improve the performance of the Get command by
using the Compare to Time setting, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base.
