TITLE   :PRB: Dynamic Grid Properties Don't Appear in Property Sheet
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

None of the dynamic properties for a Grid, such as DynamicAlignment,
DynamicBackColor, DynamicCurrentControl, DynamicFontBold, DynamicFontItalic,
DynamicFontName, and DynamicForeColor, are displayed in the Property sheet.

CAUSE
=====

The dynamic properties apply to the Grid columns, not to the grids. They are
available only for Grid columns, not for the grid itself.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you set the Grid ColumnCount to at least 1, the Dynamic Properties are
available for the column(s). If you do not set the Grid ColumnCount to at least
1, the Dynamic properties for the Grid columns can only be specified in a
program. To see a code sample, please see the code example in the "Grid Control"
topic in the Visual FoxPro Help menu.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about controlling grids, refer to the Grid Control topic in
Visual FoxPro's online Help.
