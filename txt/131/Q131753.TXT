TITLE   :Private Data Sessions Require Additional File Handles

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using private data sessions in Visual FoxPro consumes more file handles than
does using the default data session.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an indexed table with memo fields that is part of a .DBC is used in the
default data session, up to five file handles are consumed. If the same table is
used in two private data sessions, up to ten file handles are consumed.

One handle is consumed for each .DBF, .FPT, .CDX, .DBC, and .DCT file opened in
each data session. When the same table is opened in a different private data
session, additional file handles are required to maintain locking information.
If multiple tables are opened from the same database container in a single data
session, only two file handles are required for each .DBC and .DCT file in each
session.
