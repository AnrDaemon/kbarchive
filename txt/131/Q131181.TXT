The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When a user attempts to leave a form, you want to query the user to ensure that
they really want to leave the form. Using the QueryUnload event of a form, you
can ask the user, and then take appropriate action in response.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As described in the Help menu, the QueryUnload event occurs before the Destroy
event. The ReleaseType property is set prior to the QueryUnload event being
called. The QueryUnload event occurs when:

 - The CLEAR WINDOWS, RELEASE WINDOWS, or QUIT command is executed in code.

 - The user double-clicks the Control-menu box.

 - The user chooses Close from the Control menu on a Form.

QueryUnload is where you should put your exit confirmation dialog box to verify
that the user really wants to leave. The QueryUnload event uses a related
property, the ReleaseType property, to indicate how the user is exiting. This is
a particularly useful for users choosing the Close option from the Control menu
on a form.

The following table summarizes the values for the ReleaseType property and
indicates when the QueryUnload event is called.

Action                 ReleaseType Value    QueryUnload Called?
---------------------------------------------------------------
QUIT                   2                    Yes
CLEAR WINDOWS          1                    Yes
RELEASE WINDOWS        1                    Yes
Click in Close Box     1                    Yes
RELEASE thisform       0                    No

Note that the QueryUnload event is not called when a RELEASE thisform command is
called. Therefore, if you are using the RELEASE thisform command as a means of
exiting a form, you won't be able to use the code example below in the
QueryUnload event; you'll need to use an alternate method to achieve the same
result.

Code Sample
-----------

The following code sample demonstrates how to use the QueryUnload event in a
form:

      *--------------------------------------------------------------*
      * Program: QUNLDTST - QueryUnload test code                    *
      * Purpose: Demonstrates trapping user exit from form.      *
      *--------------------------------------------------------------*
      cMessageTitle = 'Test'
      cMessageText  = 'Did you *really* mean to close this form?'
      nDialogType   = 4 + 32 + 256
      *  4   = Yes and No buttons
      *  32  = Question mark icon
      *  256 = Second button is default
      nAnswer = MESSAGEBOX(cMessageText, nDialogType, cMessageTitle)
      DO CASE
        CASE nAnswer = 6
          RELEASE THISFORM
        CASE nAnswer = 7
          NODEFAULT
      ENDCASE

The use of NODEFAULT in the DO CASE construction overrides the default action of
closing the form, in effect canceling the user's actions.
