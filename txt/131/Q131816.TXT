SUMMARY
=======

In Visual Basic for Applications, the CopyFromRecordset method is used to return
data from a Data Access Object. It will return only data and will not return the
database's field headings.

The CopyFromRecordset method is used to return data from an open database to an
active worksheet. The method does not have an argument that will return the
field headings of the database. Additional code is needed to place the field
headings on the worksheet. The following example demonstrates the code needed to
return the field headings as well as the data.

Example
-------

Before you type the following code on a module sheet, you must create a reference
to the Microsoft DAO Object Library. To do this, activate the Module sheet,
click References on the Tools menu, and select the Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object
Library check box (the 3.0 Object Library check box in version 7.0).

   Sub Returning_Field_Headers_Example()
      Dim db As database
      Dim rs As Recordset
      Dim vaTmp() As String
      Dim vaNew As Variant
      Dim dbLocation As String

      ' Opens the database and creates a record set
      ' dbLocation could be any directory where the Access files are
      ' stored.

      dbLocation = "c:\access\sampapps\nwind.mdb"
      ' In version 97 use the sample file northwind.mdb usually located
      ' in c:\program files\microsoft office\office\samples\northwind.mdb
      Set db = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).OpenDatabase(dbLocation)
      Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Orders")

      ' This section fills in the field names from the Orders table.
      ReDim vaTmp(rs.Fields.Count)
      For x = 0 To rs.Fields.Count - 1
          vaTmp(x + 1) = rs.Fields(x).Name
      Next
      Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(1, 1).Resize(1, rs.Fields.Count) = vaTmp

      ' Retrieves the data to the sheet. The sheet should be called
      ' "Sheet1"
      numberOfRows = Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(2, 1).CopyFromRecordset(rs)
      Sheets("Sheet1").Activate

   End Sub
