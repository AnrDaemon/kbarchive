TITLE   :PRB: Referential Intregrity Builder Leaves Code Behind
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Referential Integrity (RI) Builder leaves code in the Stored Procedures even
when all the Trigger options are set to IGNORE.

WORKAROUND
==========

The RI Builder copies the existing contents of the Stored Procedures to a file
called RISP.OLD before it makes any changes, so you can recover modified
procedures and paste them into the current Stored Procedures.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following commands in the Command window:

      CREATE DATABASE mydbc
      CREATE TABLE myparent (id c(3) PRIMARY KEY, fname c(20), lname c(25))
      CREATE TABLE mychild ;
      (id c(3), fname c(20), FOREIGN KEY id TAG id REFERENCES myparent TAG id)
      MODIFY DATABASE

2. Double-click the Persistent Relation line that connects the two tables. This
   brings up the Edit Relationship dialog box

3. Click the Referential Integrity button to invoke the RI Builder.

4. In the RI Builder, change any of the Triggers from "Ignore" to something else
   such as "Restrict." Click the OK button, and answer "Yes" to the dialog boxes
   that follow.

5. In the Edit Relationship dialog box, click OK.

6. Enter the Stored Procedures, note the code the RI Builder produced. There
   should be one or more specific procedures depending how many changes were
   made in Step 4. These specific procedures have the table name as part of the
   procedure name. The rest of the procedures are generic (no table name in the
   procedure name).

7. Return to the top of the Stored Procedure file.

8. Add a comment to the "RIDELETE" procedure.

9. Close the Stored Procedure Window.

10. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 above.

11. Set all the Triggers back to "Ignore."

12. Repeat Steps 5 and 6.

13. Note the generic procedures that the RI Builder created are still in
   existence but the comment created in Step 8 is gone.

14. Type the following command in the Command window:

       MODIFY FILE RISP.OLD

15. Note the comment made in Step 8 exists here. You could cut and paste this
   procedure back into the current Stored Procedures file.
