OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) J2577A 10/100VG EISA LAN adapter or J2573A
10/100VG ISA LAN adapter with Windows 95, your computer may stop responding
(hang), or you may receive the following error message:

   Your adapter is not working.

CAUSE
=====

These HP network adapters run at 10 or 100 Mbps and have separate ports for the
two speeds. If you start your computer with a 10-Mbps cable plugged into the
100-Mbps port, a 100-Mbps cable plugged into the 10-Mbps port, or no network
cable plugged into either port, the NDIS 2 driver hangs the computer after the
NET START command. The NDIS 3 driver displays the error message stated above
when Windows 95 starts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, connect the correct network cable to the appropriate
port on the network adapter.
