The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from a 16-bit version of Excel, and the printer driver has the
duplex option set, Excel uses the duplex setting from Print Manager. You cannot
change the duplexing option without exiting and restarting Excel. If you choose
Print Setup from the File menu, change the duplex option, and print, the change
does not affect the printed output.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the duplexing option in Excel, choose Page Setup from the File menu,
and then choose Options.
