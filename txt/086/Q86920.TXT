SUMMARY
=======

The lpstrInitialDir member of the OPENFILENAME data structure is documented
incorrectly on page 376 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit:
Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Message, Structures, and Macros" manual for
version 3.1.

The description states that if the lpstrFile member of the same structure
specifies a valid path, the common dialog box procedure will use the path
specified by this string instead of the path specified by lpstrInitialDir. This
statement is incorrect; the common dialog box procedure uses the path specified
by lpstrInitialDir regardless of the path specified in lpstrFile. If
lpstrInitialDir is set to NULL, the system sets the initial directory to the
current directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An application can implement the documented functionality through either of two
following methods:

Method 1
--------

If lpstrFile specifies a valid path and a complete filename such as
\\AUTOEXEC.BAT, perform the following three steps:

1. Parse the string.

2. Extract the path from the string.

3. Set the lpstrInitialDir member to the extracted path.

Method 2
--------

If lpstrFile specifies a valid path and a file filter such as \\*.BAT, perform
the following four steps, as follows:

1. Implement a common dialog box hook function.

2. Modify the Flags member of the OPENFILENAME data structure to include the
   OFN_ENABLEHOOK flag.

3. Set the lpfnHook member of the OPENFILENAME data structure to point to the
   hook function.

4. In the hook function, process the WM_INITDIALOG message to send a WM_COMMAND
   message with wParam set to IDOK. Doing so causes the common dialog to change
   the current directory to the directory specified in lpstrFile.
