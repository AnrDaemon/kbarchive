The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the Microsoft Mail gateway appears to be in an infinite loop, and no mail is
getting through in either direction, then you should stop and restart the
gateway.

The only way to stop the VM side of the gateway is by typing HX. This is short
for Halt eXecution, and is used to stop any VM/CMS program. If the gateway is
looping, you may have to type HX <CR> (type HX and press ENTER) several
times before the gateway stops.

At the CMS prompt, you should check the gateway VM ID's reader for any files that
could not be processed and were causing the looping. These files should be
deleted or returned to the originator.

To restart the gateway, type IPL CMS and press ENTER.
