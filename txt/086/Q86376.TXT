TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Assistant Needs Access to Postoffice
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An assistant in Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows can be anyone from the Global
Address List (GAL); however, if the assistant is on another postoffice, there
must be a dynamic link to the user's postoffice from the assistant's postoffice.
The following error will be displayed if there is no link:

   Unable to access the file for manager.

CAUSE
=====

SCHDIST.EXE moves the information about an assistant to another postoffice. When
the assistant tries to read the meeting request in Schedule+, the postoffice
file confirms that the user is the assistant, and then tries to make the
connection. If dynamic connections have been set up, this will work normally.

Additional query words: 1.00 schedule distribution plus
