SUMMARY
=======

Troubleshooting problems with the Microsoft Mail Host Access component is
difficult and different than working on local area network (LAN) problems;
however, some of the same basic concepts apply.

It is important to obtain the version number of the Host Access software from the
customer, in order to determine if their problem has already been corrected in a
subsequent release. The release number is in the RELEASE DATA file on the 193 F
disk.

Log files can be generated on the VM side of the gateway, also. If the
ACCOUNT_INFO option in the PWAINIT EXEC file is set to YES, the LOGDATA file
will be created.

Another useful troubleshooting tool is to trace (or debug) the execution of
specific programs. Microsoft Development and Testing recommends using the TRAC
option in PWAINIT EXEC to do this.
