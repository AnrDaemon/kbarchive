TITLE   :PC Win: Update Message when Closing Unfinished OLE Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you exit while
composing a note containing an unfinished object linking and embedding (OLE)
object (where Mail is the client document and the OLE server is open and no
update has been done) you see the standard OLE "Do you want to update..."
message even when the note being composed is not the current active window.

CAUSE
=====

Applications such as Microsoft Word for Windows use only one type of active
window, but Mail for Windows uses several types. With Mail, it is possible to
have active Send Note windows, Message Finder windows, and the Message Center
Viewer window. Normally, if you try to close an application with an unfinished
OLE object in a window that is not active, the application switches to the
window with the OLE object and prompts you to update. When you close Mail with
an unfinished OLE object in a Send Note window, Mail prompts you to update the
object regardless of which window is the current active window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
