-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to run an MS-DOS-based application in a window or in the
background under Microsoft Windows you may receive the following error message:

   You cannot run this application in a window or in the background. You can
   display it in a window, but it will be suspended until you run it full
   screen. Check the PIF settings to ensure they are correct.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is most commonly caused by one of the following:

 - You are loading the Microsoft MS-DOS level mouse driver version 7.04 or later
   in the AUTOEXEC.BAT (MOUSE.COM) or in the CONFIG.SYS file (MOUSE.SYS).

 - Windows has low system resources. Closing one or more applications may free
   up enough resources to run the program in a window or in the background.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are loading the Microsoft Mouse driver 7.04 or later modify the command
line for the driver:

1. Edit AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS with a standard ASCII text editor such as
   Notepad.

2. Add "/Y" (without the quotation marks) to the end of the mouse line:

   c:\windows\mouse.com /y

   -or-

   device=c:\windows\mouse.sys /y

If Windows is low on system resources, close one or more applications.
