SUMMARY
=======

When using the MIDI Mapper Patch Maps to configure MIDI files for use with Media
Player, the MIDI file must be started at the beginning or changes will not take
effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MIDI Mapper allows you to control the way a MIDI device plays MIDI files.
Patch maps allow you to substitute one instrument on the MIDI device for
another. The Source Patch indicates the number of the instrument specified in
the MIDI file and the Destination Patch indicates the instrument number that
will actually be sent to the hardware device.

For further information about using the MIDI Mapper to configure a MIDI device,
refer to pages 185-198 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
