SUMMARY
=======

In the documentation for the JournalRecordProc on page 561 of the "Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions"
manual and in the Windows SDK online help file, the lParam parameter passed to a
JournalRecordProc callback function is documented incorrectly.

The documentation should state the lParam points to an EVENTMSG data structure,
which is defined as follows:

      typedef struct tagEVENTMSG {

      UINT  message;
      UINT  paramL;
      UINT  paramH;
      DWORD time;

      } EVENTMSG;

The EVENTMSG data structure is defined in the WINDOWS.H include file provided
with version 3.1 of the Windows SDK.

Additional query words: 3.10 WH_JOURNALRECORD
