The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Documentation for the WM_HOOKRCRESULT message was omitted from the "Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit: Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing:
Programmer's Reference" manual and from the associated online help files. The
text below provides a complete description of the message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Pen Computing sends a WM_HOOKRCRESULT message to any window that
sets a recognition hook with the SetRecogHook() function. A recognition hook
provides a method for an application to extract information from its own
recognition process or from some other application's recognition process.
Windows for Pen Computing sends the WM_HOOKRCRESULT message before it sends the
standard WM_RCRESULT.

The values of wParam and lParam are the same as those for the WM_RCRESULT
message. The wParam parameter specifies the reason the recognition terminated
(one of the REC_* codes). If wParam contains REC_OK, more results are available;
otherwise, it contains the value returned by Recognize or RecognizeData. The
lParam parameter contains a far pointer to an RCRESULT data structure.

For more information, see the documentation for the SetRecogHook() function on
pages 197-198 of the "Microsoft Windows SDK: Microsoft Windows for Pen
Computing: Programmer's Reference" manual.
