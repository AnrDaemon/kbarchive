SUMMARY
=======

This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail for
Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the [MS Proofing
Tools] section.

[MS Proofing Tools]

CustomDict=<keyname>
--------------------

This entry gives the name of an entry in the [MS Proofing Tools] section of your
WIN.INI file. That entry in turn gives the fully qualified path to a file
containing your custom dictionary. The custom dictionary contains spellings not
found in the standard dictionary, which you have added using the Add button in
the Spelling Check dialog box.

There is no default value. The purpose of this entry is to let Mail take
advantage of a custom dictionary you may have already created with another
Microsoft application, such as Word for Windows.

Spelling=<keyname>
------------------

This entry specifies the name of an entry in the [MS Proofing Tools] section of
your WIN.INI file. That entry in turn gives the fully qualified path to the
spelling checker DLL.

There is no default value. The purpose of this entry is to let Mail use the same
spelling checker you may already be using with another Microsoft application,
such as Word for Windows.
