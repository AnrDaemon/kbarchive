TITLE   :BUG: CodeView Breakpoints with Nested Quotes Unrecognized
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kb16bitonly kbCodeView kbDebug kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.05, 4.1 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft CodeView, command window commands involving nested quotes are not
recognized correctly. A breakpoint that includes nested quotation marks
generates the following error:

   CV1001 Error: Invalid Breakpoint Command

For example, the following command should create a breakpoint that executes the
function func_name when line 12 is reached:

      bp.12,, "?func_name("string")"

Instead, this command generates a CV1001 error.

It is possible to enter this type of illegal breakpoint through the breakpoint
dialog box. This causes an error message when the CURRENT.STS is read the next
time CodeView is invoked.

CAUSE
=====

CodeView incorrectly parses nested quotation marks both from the command line
and from the [debug-] section of the CURRENT.STS file where breakpoints are
saved between debugging sessions. This is a limitation of CodeView's command
syntax.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to set this type of breakpoint, use this workaround. Add a global
character array, initialized to the string you want to call the function with,
to the program. For example:

   char param[] = "string";

After recompiling the program, set the breakpoint using the variable as the
parameter instead of a literal string, as follows:

   bp.12,, "?func_name(param)"

This avoids the nested quotations and results in a breakpoint that can be saved
between debugging sessions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView versions 3.0, 3.05,
3.06, 3.07, 3.11, 3.12, 3.14, 3.5, 4.0, 4.01, 4.05, 4.1 and 4.25. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
