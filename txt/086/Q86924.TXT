SUMMARY
=======

The "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference, Volume
3: Messages, Structures and Macros" manual for version 3.1 incorrectly documents
the HELPWININFO data structure on pages 299 and 300.

According to the documentation, the wMax member of the HELPWININFO structure has
the value 0 (zero) to specify a normal-size window or 1 to specify a maximized
window. This information is incorrect; the wMax member can assume any one of ten
different values, as follows:

         Corresponding
   Value  Windows Constant    Action
   -----  ----------------    ------

     0    SW_HIDE             Hides the window and passes activation to
                              another window.

     1    SW_SHOWNORMAL       Activates and displays a window. If the
                              window is minimized or maximized, Windows
                              restores it to its original size and
                              position.

     2    SW_SHOWMINIMIZED    Activates the window and displays it as
                              an icon.

     3    SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED    Activates the window and displays it as a
                              maximized window.

     4    SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE   Displays a window in its most recent size
                              and position. The window that is currently
                              active remains active.

     5    SW_SHOW             Activates a window and displays it in its
                              current size and position.

     6    SW_MINIMIZE         Minimizes the specified window and
                              activates the top-level window in the
                              window manager's list.

     7    SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE  Displays the window as an icon. The
                              window that is currently active remains
                              active.

     8    SW_SHOWNA           Displays the window in its current state.
                              The window that is currently active
                              remains active.

     9    SW_RESTORE          Same as SW_SHOWNORMAL.

Note that these constants are valid only for Windows Help running with Microsoft
Windows. These constants may change if Help is ported to another platform.
