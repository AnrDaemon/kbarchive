The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), the
section of the TIPS.HLP online help file that describes the contents of the
redistributable files directory incorrectly states that all the dynamic- link
libraries (DLLs) in the directory operate under Microsoft Windows versions 3.0
and 3.1.

PENWIN.DLL implements the Pen Extensions under Microsoft Windows 3.1. The Pen
Extensions to Windows, and the OEM product Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing,
each require the Windows 3.1 environment. Applications based solely on the Pen
Extensions will not run under Windows 3.0. An application that uses the Pen
Extensions should do one of the following:

 - Use the Resource Compiler /31 switch to prevent the application from running
   under Windows 3.0.

 - Code the application to dynamically configure itself according to the
   installed version of Windows.

Additional query words: 1.00 no32bit
