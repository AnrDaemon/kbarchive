The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The CONFIG.SYS files do not change when either the X.25 Eicon card or the
redirector software is installed.

The AUTOEXEC.BAT files may contain the following startup:

   Server Startup
      nabios srv gateway /4
      ecload

Or, if the workstation is a redirector workstation:

   Eicon Redirector Software Startup
      nabios rdr gateway /4
      x25net start

A typical X.400 startup batch file appears as follows:

   x400gate -dq -lv

The Eicon X.25 card installation manual contains additional examples of
installation and startup batch files.
