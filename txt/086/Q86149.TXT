The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a problem or an error occurs with the Microsoft Mail Host Access component
programs, the gateway can generate an incident report file which contains
incoming and outgoing mailbags (including the text of the messages), and dumps
of the gateway configuration files.

Using the INCIDENT_OPTIONS field in the PWAINIT EXEC file, the VM administrator
can specify which messages/attachments they want to have included in the
INCIDENT REPORT file (that is, messages/attachments from the LAN or
messages/files from the VM). The details on how to do this are listed in the
"Microsoft Mail Host Access for IBM PROFS and OfficeVision VM Administrator's
Guide."
