SUMMARY
=======

The Magic Cursor! mouse pointer editing software by Fanfare Software is designed
to allow you to specify a hot-key combination for program activation or
deactivation. If this hot-key combination coincides with a Windows keyboard
command, the Magic Cursor! hot key takes precedence.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Magic Cursor! is designed to allow you to change the appearance of the mouse
pointer for greater visibility. You can change the size and shape of the mouse
pointer or choose from a set of 40 predesigned cursors, including arrows, hands,
pencils, pens, mice, and jets.

The Magic Cursor! activation\deactivation hot key can consist of any combination
of the CTRL+X, ALT+X, or SHIFT+X keys, where X is an additional key that you
specify. For example, CTRL+1 could be an activation\deactivation hot key.

If you decide to create a Magic Cursor! hot key, be careful not to duplicate the
Windows keyboard commands if you want to use Windows keyboard commands in the
Windows environment.

For a listing of Windows keyboard commands, query on the words:
