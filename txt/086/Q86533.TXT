SUMMARY
=======

The Panasonic EPL-8541 and EPL-8543 printers are not supported under Microsoft
Windows. However, Panasonic has a special configuration that may allow these
printers to print in Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The EPL-8541 and EPL-8543 are Panasonic's Color Thermal Transfer printers. The
EPL-8541 uses a centronics parallel interface whereas the EPL-8543 uses an RGB
video (analog) interface.

There currently are no printer drivers for these printers, and Panasonic
recommends that an emulation not be used. Panasonic is working on drivers for
these printers, which will be released soon. If you must use Windows to print to
these printers, Panasonic has a special configuration that can be obtained by
calling Panasonic.

The EPL-8541 and EPL-8543 are manufactured by Panasonic, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
