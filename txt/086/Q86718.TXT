TITLE   :DOCERR: Setup Toolkit _MSTEST "Bad Destination Value" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the _MSTEST application in the Microsoft Windows Setup Toolkit processes a
Setup information (.INF) file, processing stops with the error message

   Bad Destination value in INF File Description line.

CAUSE
=====

The sixth file property of each file's description must be empty.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the .INF file to remove any value from the sixth file property of each
file description. Specify each file's destination directory as a parameter to
the function that adds the file to the copy list (AddSectionFilesToCopyList,
AddSectionKeyFileToCopyList, or AddSpecialFileToCopyList).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Setup Toolkit for Windows"
manual documents the "Files" section of the .INF file format on pages 118-121.
On page 119, in Table A.1, the sixth property in a file description is called
the destination property and is documented to contain the destination directory
for the file. This is incorrect; the sixth field of a file entry must be blank.
