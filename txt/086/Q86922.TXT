The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft C/C++ Optimizing Compiler version 7.0 includes the Microsoft
Segmented Executable Linker (LINK) version 5.3. By default, when LINK
version 5.3 links an application for Microsoft Windows, the executable file
is compatible only with protected mode.

To override this default, specify the REALMODE directive in the
application's module definition (DEF) file. Note that Windows 3.1 no longer
supports real mode applications.

The REALMODE directive is documented on page 617 of the "Microsoft C/C++
Environment and Tools" version 7.0 manual.

Additional query words: 3.00 no32bit 3.10
