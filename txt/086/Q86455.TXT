KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the WINFILE.INI file is assigned the hidden or system attribute, the
following error message is displayed when you run Windows 3.1:

   Application Error
   WINFILE Caused a General Protection Fault
   in module USER.EXE at XXXX:XXXX

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this error, remove the hidden or system attribute from the
WINFILE.INI file.

To display the current attributes of a file, change to the directory the file is
in. Type the following command, then press ENTER:

   attrib <filename>

To change the attributes of a file, change to the directory that the file is in.
Use the following command, then press ENTER:

   attrib [+r|-r] [+a|-a] [+s|-s] [+h|-h] [drive:][path][filename]

MORE INFORMATION
================

The File Manager (WINFILE.EXE) uses the WINFILE.INI file to store configuration
information. If the WINFILE.INI does not exist, it is created by WINFILE.EXE
when launched. The MS-DOS hidden and/or system attributes make the WINFILE.INI
invisible to WINFILE.EXE. When WINFILE.EXE attempts to create a new WINFILE.INI
file, MS-DOS generates a file creation error, because this file already exists.
This error generates the GP fault message.
