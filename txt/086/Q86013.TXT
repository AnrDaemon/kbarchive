-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Windows Setup program located in the Main group of
Windows, the following error message may occur:

   Cannot find the SETUP.INF file necessary to run setup. Be sure that the file
   is in a directory on the default path.

CAUSE
=====

The SETUP.INF file is an information file that Windows Setup uses to install
Windows system and application files, and to create program groups. This error
can occur if the SETUP.INF file is not in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory or if
the SETUP.INF file is being accessed by another program.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the file is missing, you can copy it directly from the Windows 3.0 or 3.1
Setup disk #1. The SETUP.INF on disk #1 is not compressed.

If SETUP.INF is being accessed by Write or another application, close the
application before running Windows Setup. In Windows 3.0 the following error
message also appears

   System Error
   Sharing violation on drive <x>:

where <x> is the drive letter where the file is located.
