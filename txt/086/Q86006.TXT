SUMMARY
=======

The DdeUnaccessData function is incorrectly documented on page 196 of the
"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference, Volume 2:
Functions" manual, as follows:

   The DdeUnaccessData function frees a global memory object.

The DdeUnaccessData function "unaccesses" a global memory object accessed by
DdeAccessData. These functions are similar to GlobalUnlock and GlobalLock,
respectively.

Additional query words: 3.10 no32bit
