TITLE   :BUG: LIBENTRY.ASM Missing Include File Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to assemble the LIBENTRY.ASM file distributed with version 3.1 of the
Microsoft Windows SDK fails with the following message:

   Include file not found: CONVDLL.INC.

CAUSE
=====

CONVDLL.INC is an assembly-language include file required to support the
Microsoft Windows Libraries for OS/2 (WLO). Because CONVDLL.INC is not required
to create Windows dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), it is not included in the
Windows SDK.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the LIBENTRY.ASM file to remove or comment out the following line from
the file:

   INCLUDE CONVDLL.INC

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the LIBENTRY.ASM file included
in version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows SDK. We will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
