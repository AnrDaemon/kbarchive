SUMMARY
=======

A help file built for version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows Help application can
extend the Windows Help application via a number of built-in macro commands.
These macros allow the help file author to create a new menu item or button and
to delete an added item once it is no longer needed.

However, one cannot use the DeleteItem and DestroyButton macros to remove a
standard menu item from the Windows Help application's menus or to remove a
button from the standard button bar.

The standard menu items are fixed by the Windows Help application; however, one
can modify the behavior of the standard buttons via the ChangeButtonBinding
macro.

For more information on Windows Help macros, see Section 15.4 (starting on page
302) of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference,
Volume 4: Resources" manual or the MACROHLP application provided with the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) in the advanced samples
directory (by default, C:\WINDEV\SAMPLES).
