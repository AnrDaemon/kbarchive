======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can move a Schedule+ local file to a network drive; however, when you try to
start Schedule+, the following error message is displayed:

   <Drive>:\>path>\XXXXXXXX.CAL is not a valid local schedule file.
   Is it okay to delete it?

If the drive is not mapped to any server, choosing OK for the above message
displays the following message:

   The local schedule file could not be created

CAUSE
=====

The network drive must be available when Schedule+ is started off line. This
error occurs if the drive is not available, or if that server is mapped to
another drive letter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Schedule+ local file can be moved to any drive for easy transportation to
another computer for home or portable use. When you start up Schedule+ off line,
Schedule+ looks in the SCHDPLUS.INI file to find the path to the local calendar
file. If the file is damaged, missing, or hidden, Schedule+ cannot start until a
new file is created in the same location.
