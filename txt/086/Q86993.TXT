======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In File Manager, to view network directories and files with long names greater
than the MS-DOS standard convention, use the following entry in the WINFILE.INI
file's [SETTINGS] section:

        longfilenames=1

This information applies to LAN Manager version 2.1. This entry works only for
the LANMAN21.DRV driver used with Windows version 3.1; it does not work with
Windows for Workgroups.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This switch does not exist in the WINFILE.INI file by default and must be added
to see directories and files with long names greater than the MS-DOS convention.
The MS-DOS convention is eight characters followed by a period (.), and then
three more characters (for example, FILENAME.EXT).

Many networks, such as LAN Manager networks running on OS/2 servers, support
directories and filenames greater than the MS-DOS standard convention.

FEATURES OF LONG FILENAME SUPPORT
---------------------------------

1. You can rename a long filename to a shorter filename.

2. You can rename a short filename to a longer filename.

3. You can copy the long filename from one directory on the server to another
   directory on the server.

4. You can copy a long filename from the server to a local MS-DOS partitioned
   hard disk, but will receive the following message about needing to shorten
   the filename:

   This path does not match the DOS format for filenames. Please enter a new
   name.

5. Windows 3.1's Association feature will not function on files with long names.
   For more information on the Association feature, refer to the pages 130-132
   of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

6. Windows 3.1 applications cannot open files with long names.

   Write displays the following error message:

   This filename is not valid.

   Notepad displays the following error message:

   Cannot find LONGFILENAME.EXT.

   Do you want to create a new file?

   Answering either Yes or No, creates a new untitled document.

Workaround:

Rename the file to a short filename and then you can open it.

FEATURES OF LONG DIRECTORY NAME SUPPORT
---------------------------------------

1. File Manager will allow you to create directories with long names on the
   server after displaying the following message:

   File Manager may not be able to access files created in the directory
   "X:\LONGDIRNAME".

   Do you want to continue?

2. If a short filename or long filename file is located in a directory that has
   a long directory name, then the Run command under the File menu will be
   unavailable (dimmed).
