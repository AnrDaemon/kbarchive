======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear in Windows version 3.1 when you attempt
to paste text from Word for MS-DOS to another MS-DOS application:

   There is no text in the clipboard

CAUSE
=====

The above error message is generated when Word for MS-DOS version 5.5 runs in
Graphics mode.

When you run Word for MS-DOS in a Window and using the Edit Mark option, text is
copied into the Windows Clipboard. In Clipboard, the display from Word for
MS-DOS is received as a bitmap instead of text.

RESOLUTION
==========

Setting the Display Mode option in Word for MS-DOS to Text mode should correct
this problem. From the Word for MS-DOS View menu, choose Preferences. Change the
Display Mode option from Graphics to Text. This will allow the pasting of text
from Word for MS-DOS to another MS-DOS-based application.
