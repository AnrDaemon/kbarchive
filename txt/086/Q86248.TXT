SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear in Windows 3.1 when you try to run a
program from a floppy disk drive:

   Insufficient memory to run application; close one or more applications to
   increase available memory and try again.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the CMOS settings for the floppy disk drive are correct. If the
drive is set incorrectly (for example, you select 720K when the drive is a
1.44MB), selecting the correct setting should correct the problem.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run an application from the floppy disk drive by choosing Run from the
File menu in Program Manager, the above error message may occur if the drive is
incorrectly configured.

An incorrect CMOS floppy disk drive setting may also display the following
message:

   Cannot find file <X>:<FILENAME> (or one of its components). Check
   to ensure the path and filename are correct and that all required libraries
   are available.

where <X> is the floppy disk drive letter and <FILENAME> is the name
of the program being loaded.

When you attempt to install an application from the floppy disk drive, the
following message may be displayed:

   Not enough memory to start the specified application.
