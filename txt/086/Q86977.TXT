SUMMARY
=======

The X.121 is an address that enables packets to be sent to people on a public
data network. The X.25 network uses X.121 addresses to determine routing within
the X.25 network.

The X.121 address can be equated to a voice phone number on a telephone network.

The X.121 address length for an international data number is a 10-digit numeric
character set from 0 to 9. The number formats for various data accesses are as
follows:

   International data number:

   P + DNIC + NTN

   Or, if the number is part of a national integrated numbering scheme:

   P + DCC + National Number

   Public telephone network:

   P + 9 + TCC + National Significant Telephone Number

   Public Telex network

   P + 8 + TDC + National Telex Number

Here are descriptions of the acronyms used above:
