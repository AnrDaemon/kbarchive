The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Before you install the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, you need to
perform the following steps:

1. Connect to the network drive where the Microsoft Mail data files are located.
   You must have full access rights to the mail data files.

2. On the local drive of the dedicated gateway PC, create a subdirectory for the
   gateway files. You must create a directory before installation; the
   installation program does not do this for you.

3. Log on to both the 3+Open Network and the 3+Name Service as the
   administrative user.

4. Make note of the name of the 3+Mail Service that is running.

Once you have done this, make sure you have the following information ready for
the installation:

 - The drive and path to the directory where the gateway files are to go.

 - The unique DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION the _GATEWAY user will be defined in.

   This must be a new DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION; it uniquely identifies the 3+Mail
   gateway. This DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION is created in the 3+Name Service. The
   _GATEWAY user also is created in this DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION, which acts as the
   mailbag for all mail going from 3+Mail to MS Mail.

 - The full three-part name of the mail server for the _GATEWAY user. This is in
   the format SERVERNAME:DOMAIN:ORGANIZATION.

The remaining installation questions can be changed later or left at the default.
