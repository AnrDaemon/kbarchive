TITLE   :FIX: Macros w/ Different Case Can't Be Assigned to Each Other
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for OS/2, versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NMAKE version 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, or 1.2 macros that are the same but have a
different case cannot be assigned to one another. This kind of macro assignment
results in nothing being assigned. For example, the sample makefile below
displays

   upper and

when the output should be as follow:

   upper and lowercase

RESOLUTION
==========

Even though NMAKE macros are case sensitive, this type of assignment is not
successful. Two workarounds are:

 - Use a temporary MACRO to perform the assignment. For example,

        target= file.exe;
        TEMP = $(target)
        TARGET = $(TEMP)

-or-

 - Give each macro a unique name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in NMAKE versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13,
and 1.2 for MS-DOS and versions 1.11, 1.12, and 1.13 for OS/2. This problem was
corrected in NMAKE version 1.3.

Sample Makefile
---------------

   target = lowercase
   TARGET = upper and $(target)

   ALL:

      @echo $(TARGET)
