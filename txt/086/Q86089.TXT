-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows Administration program, bringing up
the Add Gateways window from the Distribution Settings window will show all
the gateways installed in the postoffice even if there are no compatible
scheduling programs on the other side of these gateways. Distribution
Settings can be chosen from the Administration menu. Adding any of these
gateways will enable SCHDIST to begin sending updates that the gateway does
not understand. This may cause the gateway to start displaying error
messages.

This feature allows for future compatibility with foreign scheduling
systems such as IBM PROFS without requiring an update of the Schedule+
Administration program. To determine if there is compatibility, check with
the maker of the foreign scheduling system or with a Microsoft Messaging
Specialist.
