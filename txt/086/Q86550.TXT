SUMMARY
=======

An MHS Host is a microcomputer running the Message Handling Service (MHS)
software. The host itself can be a standalone computer or, more commonly, a LAN
workstation.

There are three main components of MHS:

 - The Directory Manager

 - The Connectivity Manager

 - The Transport Server

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are descriptions of each of the main components listed above:

   Component              Description
   ---------              -----------

   Directory Manager      Administrators use the Directory Manager to
                          define the MHS database and manage software
                          applications that use MHS. The database itself
                          is a directory structure containing routes to
                          users, hosts, and workgroups. This routing
                          information is called the routing table.

   Connectivity Manager   This part of MHS routes messages within the
                          database.

   Transport Server       The Transport Server transfers the routed
                          messages between MHS hosts.
