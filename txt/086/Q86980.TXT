The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 performs address conversion on both incoming
mail and outgoing mail.

On incoming mail, the address conversion is done to the address in the TO: field
only. The FROM: field is not altered because the X.400 message must be retained.
If an Microsoft Mail user wants to reply to the incoming message, the unaltered
address in the FROM: field will be moved into the TO: field so the message can
be sent back.

On outgoing mail, the FROM: field is changed from Microsoft Mail for PCs format
to the X.400 format, whereas the TO: field is not altered. This conversion can
be done by either the address conversion table or by the Advanced Address
Mapping.
