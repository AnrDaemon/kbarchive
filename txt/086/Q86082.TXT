SYMPTOMS
========

If a shared folder is open and Microsoft Mail for Windows exits unexpectedly,
the shared folder will not be unlocked and therefore cannot be deleted.

RESOLUTION

To correct this problem, run the FOLDCOMP.EXE utility in the shared folder
directory (FOLDERS\PUB) of the database. Include the -S parameter. For example:

   foldcomp -s

The FOLDCOMP.EXE utility is located in the UTIL directory on Server Disk 3.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
