SUMMARY
=======

When you print to file using the HPPCL4 driver included in Microsoft Windows
3.1, a font summary file is created. This file includes a list of all device
fonts, soft fonts, and cartridge fonts. The filename is the driver name with an
extension consisting of a letter and two numbers. For example:

 - HPPCL.P00

 - HPDSKJET.P01

MORE INFORMATION
================

Applications can request font information from UNIDRV.DLL for display purposes.
Rather than have UNIDRV.DLL check the WIN.INI file each time for this
information, it creates a list in a font summary file. This file is changed
every time you change cartridges in the driver, add/delete soft fonts, and so
on. The next time an application asks for this font information, UNIDRV.DLL
responds with this previously generated list. The performance gain is directly
proportionate to the number of soft fonts installed.
