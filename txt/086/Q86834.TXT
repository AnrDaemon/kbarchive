SUMMARY
=======

The "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference, Volume
3: Messages, Structures, and Macros" manual for version 3.1 describes the
tmPitchAndFamily member of the TEXTMETRIC data structure on pages 410 and 411.
This documentation incorrectly states that the TMPF_PITCH bit of this member
designates a fixed-pitch font.

The WINDOWS.H header file does not define a TMPF_PITCH value; the correct name is
TMPF_FIXED_PITCH.

According to the documentation, when the TMPF_PITCH bit is set, the font has a
fixed pitch. This statement is incorrect; when a font has the TMPF_FIXED_PITCH
bit set, the font has a variable pitch.

Additional query words: 3.10 docerr
