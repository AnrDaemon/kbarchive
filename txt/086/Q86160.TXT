The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The amount of virtual storage and disk space allocated to the Microsoft
Mail gateway VM ID may have to be increased to handle larger messages and
files. This is usually something that is handled by the VM administrator
in charge of the gateway.

Microsoft recommends at least 2 MB of virtual storage for the gateway VM
ID. This can be increased to 3 MB, for example, by typing the following
at the CMS prompt, then pressing ENTER:

   " CP DEF STOR 3M" (without the quotation marks)

 
After the command has completed, you must re-IPL CMS to have the change
take effect.
 

Only the VM administrator should increase disk space for the gateway
disks.
