======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Delrina Technologies' Perform Pro version 1.0 can cause Walldata's Rumba version
3 update 4 to lose selected settings. These settings are reset to their default
parameters, which include settings for color, printers, and FTX setup.

The problem occurs when Perform Pro is loaded or unloaded.

CAUSE
=====

Perform Pro sends a Windows message to all top-level windows with a value of
WM_USER+9. This message should not be sent. Rumba responds to this message by
resetting its profile to the default values.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is a known issue between Rumba and Perform Pro, but may also occur with
other programs. It has been reported that Delrina has confirmed this to be a
problem and plans to correct it with its next release.
