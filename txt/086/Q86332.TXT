TITLE   :PRB: Bitmap Causes Windows Help Compiler Out-of-Memory Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows Help Compiler compiles an RTF
(rich-text format) file, the compiler runs out of memory. This occurs in the
HC31.EXE application running under MS-DOS or OS/2 and in the HCP.EXE application
that uses extended memory under MS-DOS.

CAUSE
=====

The RTF file contains a pasted bitmap larger than 64K.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the bitmap from the RTF source and store it in a file. Import the bitmap
into the RTF source file by reference. For more information on importing a
bitmap by reference, see page 29 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development
Kit: Programming Tools" manual, and pages 258-260 of the "Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference, Volume 4: Resources" manual.
