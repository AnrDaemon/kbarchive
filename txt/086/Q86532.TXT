PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a full page of text in landscape mode from Microsoft Windows 3.1,
the Canon LPB-8 II printer may display the following error message and stop
printing:

   21 Complex Data

WORKAROUND
==========

Changing the Graphics setting to 150 x 150 may correct this problem. However,
the document will print in a lower resolution. To change this setting, do the
following:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Printers icon.

3. Select the Canon LPB-8 II printer, and choose the Setup button.

4. Under Graphics, select 150 x 150.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Canon LBP-8 II printer
driver version 3.09. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Printing in landscape mode on the Canon LBP-8 II may result in the above message
when the text being printed is more than half a page in length. A document in
landscape mode that contains less than half a page of text should print
normally.

Printing in portrait mode does not seem to be a problem. Disabling Print Manager,
the Fast Printing Direct To Port option, or TrueType fonts seems to have no
effect on this problem.
