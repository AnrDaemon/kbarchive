If printing problems occur in Microsoft Windows 3.1, you may need to reinstall a

Before making any printer changes, make a backup copy of the WIN.INI file, which
is located in the WINDOWS directory.

Steps to Reinstall a Windows 3.0 Printer Driver in Windows 3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Find the Windows 3.0 disk that contains the printer driver, and insert the
   disk in drive A or B.

2. From Control Panel choose Printers. Select the current Windows 3.1 printer,
   then choose the Remove button.

3. In File Manager change to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. Select the Windows
   3.1 printer driver and choose Delete from the File menu.

4. Reinstall the printer driver by running Control Panel and choosing Printers.

   a. Choose the Add button.

   b. Select the Install Unlisted Or Updated Printer option.

reference the Windows 3.1 printer driver.
