KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up Windows on a network (using Setup /N) and you manually disable
Print Manager by changing Spooler=Yes to Spooler=No in the [windows] section of
the WIN.SRC file, the Spooler=Yes change does not remain in your personal
WIN.INI file. The setting reverts back to Spooler=Yes.

CAUSE
=====

The only way to disable Print Manager is to clear the Use Print Manager check
box in the Printers option of Control Panel.

In Windows 3.1, the WIN.SRC (source file) that is found in the shared network
directory (created by running Setup /A) is used as a source file for a user's
WIN.INI file (created by running Setup /N).

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 WIN.SRC Spooler Print Manager
