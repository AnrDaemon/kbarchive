SYMPTOMS
========

When a document is printed from Microsoft Windows 3.1 using the Hewlett- Packard
(HP) LaserJet IIIsi printer driver in PostScript mode on a network system with
Gray Matter Software's Script Server software, the printer prints PostScript
code instead of text or graphics.

CAUSE
=====

Script Server is network printer-queuing software that supports all PostScript 1
and PostScript 2 printers and languages. When a file is sent to the printer
through the network, Script Server intercepts the file and determines whether it
is a PostScript file based on its header line. If Script Server identifies the
file as a PostScript file, Script Server queues it and sends it to the printer.
If Script Server identifies the file as a non-PostScript file, Script Server
wraps the file in PostScript code and then queues it.

The Windows 3.1 HP LaserJet IIIsi driver has two driver modes, PostScript and
native (PCL). When a user selects the PostScript driver mode, the HP LaserJet
IIIsi driver adds a header line to the file that tells the printer which mode to
print the file in. In this case, since the PostScript identifier is no longer in
the (first) header line, Script Server does not recognize the file as a
PostScript file, and wraps it in PostScript code before sending it to the
printer. The result is a printout of PostScript code.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select the HP LaserJet IIID driver instead of the HP LaserJet IIIsi. The HP
LaserJet IIID driver does not insert an additional header line; therefore,
Script Server can correctly identify PostScript files. The HP LaserJet IIID does
not provide output bin selection, as the HP LaserJet IIIsi does, but other than
that, the drivers are functionally identical.
