SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Logitech's Ansel image editing package under Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1, the grayscale palette may display only 8 shades of
gray instead of 16.

CAUSE
=====

According to Ansel technical support, when running Ansel under Windows 3.1, the
VGA Palette option should not be selected. If the color palette is selected and
a 16-color video driver is used, only 8 shades of gray and standard colors will
be available.

With the color palette not selected, no colors will be available. However, all 16
shades of gray will appear. This problem does not occur when using a 256-color
video driver or in Windows version 3.0.

The Ansel product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
