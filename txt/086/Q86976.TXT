SUMMARY
=======

Mapping or address conversion can be chosen by the network administrator. As
defined by CCITT, the country (c), Administrative Domain (ADMD), and personal
name (PN) are all mandatory and the others are optional.

Generally, when connecting to a public network, the public network administrator
will assign you part of your O/R address. For example, if you are connecting to
datapac and you want to access datapac in Vancouver, you can connect to the
University of British Columbia, and they will assign you part of your address:

   c=ca;admd=telecom.canada;prmd=cdn;o=bc;

You can define the rest of the address. For a Microsoft Mail product, you may
want to use:

   ou=Microsoft;ou=Marketing;pn=John.Smith

Then your address might become:

   c=ca;admd=telecom.canada;prmd=cdn;o=bc;ou=Microsoft;ou=Marketing;
   pn=John.Smith

(Note: Enter the text above on one line, with no spaces; an additional line is
shown because of line-length restrictions in knowledge base format.)
