The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS supports MHS versions 1.5N,
1.5M, 1.5P, and all earlier versions, including versions 1.11 and 1.21.

N after the version number denotes that it is a NetWare version

M after the version number denotes that it is an MS-Net compatible version (for
example, LAN Manager).

P after the version number denotes that it is a personal (standalone) version.

The gateway can operate as an SMF level 70 gateway when installed on MHS version
1.5 hosts. It can optionally be run as an SMF level 64 gateway if the situation
demands this.

On version 1.21 and 1.1 hosts, the gateway always operates as an SMF level 64
gateway. This is a limitation in the MHS version, not in MS Mail; MHS 1.21 and
1.1 do not support SMF 70.

For more information about the differences among SMF levels, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   "pcmail" (without the quotation marks) and "MHS" (without the quotation
   marks) and "Gateway" (without the quotation marks) and "communicate" (without
   the quotation marks)
