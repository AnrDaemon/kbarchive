The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a Windows version 3.1 screen saver is active and Calendar's alarm goes off,
Calendar's popup dialog box does display unless the screen saver is interrupted
by the keyboard or mouse.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Calendar is the active window when the alarm goes off, a dialog box displays
to remind you of an appointment. If Calendar is an inactive window, the Calendar
title bar and borders flash. If Calendar is an icon, the icon flashes.

Using an active screen saver at the alarm time will prevent any of these effects
from being seen until a mouse or keyboard action interrupts the screen saver.
