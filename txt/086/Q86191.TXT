PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your system resources are depleted when you run Berkeley Systems' After Dark
version 2.0.

CAUSE
=====

If After Dark 2.0 is configured to use Aquatic Realm, Flying Toasters, Marbles
or any combination of the three with the Randomizer feature enabled, system
resources are allocated but not released. As reported in the Program Manager
Help About dialog box, this depletes your system resources when you run After
Dark 2.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be corrected by replacing AD_RSRC.DLL with a patched version
that is available from Berkeley Systems' technical support. AD_RSRC.DLL is also
available on CompuServe in the WINAPC forum or on America Online in the
BerkSysWin forum.
