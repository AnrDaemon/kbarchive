The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS will poll a Microsoft "mailbag" for mail
messages destined for transfer via MHS and create an MHS header from this when
using MHS version 1.5N. The file is then placed in the
MHS\MAIL\GATES\<Gateway-name>\IN directory, where the Connectivity Manager
will pick it up for routing.

For MHS mail destined for Microsoft Mail, the gateway polls the
MHS\MAIL\GATES\<gateway-name>\OUT subdirectory and transfers the message
to the appropriate Microsoft Mail user.

There are differences between MHS version 1.5N and MHS version 1.1N in that
version 1.1N requires messages to be submitted to MHS with a 128- byte binary
routing envelope and a complete message header. This type of message format is
known as SMF-64. MHS version 1.5N introduced support for SMF-70, which supports
a much simpler format: no binary routing envelope is required, just a minimal
submission header. MHS 1.5 will convert this header to a canonical header. The
MS Mail gateway submits this canonical header type message when sending mail
out.
