SUMMARY
=======

MHS is an acronym for Message Handling Service. The term MHS is widely used by
many mail systems to describe their message handling service implementation, but
normally there is little or no consistency among these implementations. In this
article, MHS refers to Action Technologies' and Novell's implementation of a
store-and-forward electronic mail system.

MHS is a software program designed for the reliable routing and transfer of
electronic messages from one location to another. MHS, using its file transfer
protocol, modem control, routing tables, transport protocol, and error checking,
handles all the issues associated with getting information from the sending
workstation to the destination workstation, error free, regardless of the LAN
and WAN topologies between the sender and recipient.
