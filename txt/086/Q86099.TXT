SUMMARY
=======

This article lists and describes all the entries in the Microsoft Mail for
Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the [Custom Menus]
section.

[Custom Menus]

This section may contain any number of entries (within reason). Each entry
specifies a menu name to be added to the Mail menu bar. You can use these menus
to group custom commands and/or messages under a single, distinctive menu item.
This section may appear both in the usual location, MSMAIL.INI in your Windows
directory, and in SHARED.INI in the directory pointed to by the
SharedExtensionsDir entry of MSMAIL.INI. Below is a synopsis of the custom
command entry format, followed by two examples. A description of each subfield
follows. Each entry must occupy a single line. Many subfields are optional.

                   compatible; 3.2 is the current version.

                   may include an ampersand (&) just before the letter that
                   is to serve as an ALT+<key> accelerator.

                   directly after it.

                   user cursors to the menu.
