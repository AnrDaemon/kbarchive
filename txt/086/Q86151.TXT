The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using XEDIT to edit any of the Microsoft Mail gateway's configuration files
should not cause any problems, because it is not possible to edit the files
while the gateway is running.

Once the gateway VM ID is logged on and running the gateway program, you cannot
logon again to the same VM ID. The VM administrator can also ensure that no
other VM ID has the ability to link to the disks that contain the gateway's
configuration files. The combination of these two factors effectively prevents
anybody from XEDITing the files while the gateway is running.
