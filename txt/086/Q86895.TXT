SUMMARY
=======

From within Program Manager, you can use the /P parameter to run the Windows
Setup, forcing it to rebuild the default Program Manager groups and icons. This
feature behaves differently in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1.

You can interfere with this maintenance mode operation.

MORE INFORMATION WINDOWS 3.0
----------------------------

How Setup /P Works:

For Windows 3.0, Setup /P will rebuild the default groups for Program Manager,
(Main, Accessories, Games) in a "destructive" manner. That is, when it rebuilds
the groups, it will do so from scratch; the new groups will NOT include any
icons that you added to the group. In addition, the window's size and location
will be overwritten.

Possible Problems:

During the process of rebuilding the groups, the mouse cursor is live. If you
select a group during the process, an Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE) may
occur, or the system may stop, except for the mouse cursor.

It is also possible that if you select one of the groups as they are being
rebuilt, the next icons added in the sequence will be put in the wrong group. If
a group is selected before it is rebuilt, the next icons to be added will be put
in the wrong group temporarily, until the additional groups are rebuilt.

To correct these problems, run Setup /P again and do not use the keyboard or
mouse while the process is running.

MORE INFORMATION WINDOWS 3.1
----------------------------

How Setup /P Works:

For Windows 3.1, Setup /P will rebuild the default Program Manager Groups, (Main,
Accessories, Games, Startup), in a non-destructive manner. This process will
KEEP any icons you have added to the default groups, and it will not alter the
size or window location of these groups. Setup will restore the original icons
for any of the default items if they have been changed.

Because this is a "non-destructive" process, you will have to use the following
procedure to restore the default groups as they would be at installation time:

1. Exit Windows 3.1.

2. Delete the file PROGMAN.INI from the WINDOWS directory.

3. Start Windows again. Program Manager should load without any groups.

4. From the File Menu, choose Run.

5. Type the following text and press ENTER.

   setup /p

This will rebuild the groups back to their default contents.

Possible Problems:

The mouse cursor is active during this rebuilding process. If you select either
an open group, or a minimized group, the rebuilding process will add the next
icons in the rebuilding sequence to that group. Whether you exit Windows Saving
Settings or not, you will still have these groups with non-default icons. Due to
the "non-destructive" process, use the method above for deleting PROGMAN.INI,
and returning to the original default groups.

If you select a minimized group (which opens the Control menu) during the
rebuilding process, after the rebuilding process the hourglass pointer will not
return to a standard pointer. Moving the mouse will return it to the standard
mouse pointer.
