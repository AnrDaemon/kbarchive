======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use an earlier Thomas Conrad token ring network card with Microsoft
Windows version 3.1, you may receive the following error message when you start
Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode:

   Error loading [display].DRV

where [display] is the video driver being used by Windows.

The system may also stop or return to an MS-DOS command prompt without an error
message.

NOTE: Windows runs correctly in standard mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

Loading the BUFFER.COM program provided by Thomas Conrad may correct this
problem. Some earlier Thomas Conrad token ring cards require that the BUFFER.COM
file be loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file before running Windows 3.1 in 386
enhanced mode. This file is necessary to allow the network driver to co-exist
with the HIMEM.SYS memory manager. The BUFFER.COM file can be found on Disk #1
of the Thomas Conrad Network Drivers disks in the NW_WKSTN directory.

Another alternative is to download the TOKIPX.EXE file from the Thomas Conrad
bulletin board service (BBS). This is a self-extracting file containing the
necessary updates to allow the Network card to work successfully with HIMEM.SYS.
After you update these files, you won't need BUFFER.COM.
