======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print large and/or graphically intensive files on a Novell NetWare 3.11
shared printer, the output may appear garbled, incomplete, or it may contain
form feeds.

CAUSE
=====

These problems may be caused by a PSERVER.NLM file dated earlier than 1/9/92.
This file is located in the NetWare SYSTEM subdirectory.

WORKAROUND
==========

You need to update the PSERVER.NLM file.

The current version is available on CompuServe, or from Novell. To download the
file from CompuServe, do the following:

1. At the CompuServe ! prompt, type "go novell" (without the quotation marks).

2. From \\NOVLIB\LIB#6, download PSERV1.ZIP.

The ZIP file contains five files. Replace the old PSERVER.NLM file with the new
one.

To obtain phone numbers for Novell, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   "Novell" (without the quotation marks) and "phonebook" (without the quotation
   marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Novell NetWare 3.11, each print job creates a file. The file is sent to a
share that has a 3K buffer, segmented in 512 bytes. A pointer is used to keep
track of where the print job file should continue after each dump of the 3K
buffer. On very large and/or graphically intensive jobs, this pointer may go
past the 3K barrier, thus pointing to another area on the net drive containing
the print files. This causes the garbled output.
