SUMMARY
=======

In the products listed above, the following errors can occur when you define a
variable in a loop that is within a case statement. The following error occurs
when "default" is the next case:

   C2361 Initialization of 'x' is skipped by 'default' label

When default is not next, the following error appears:

   C2360 Initialization of 'x' is skipped by 'case' label

A similar error also occurs when a goto is before the loop:

   C2362 Initialization of 'x' is skipped by 'goto label name'

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the two samples below, it can be seen that the variable is initialized when
it is declared. The errors are generated because the scope of the variable, when
it is defined and initialized, is in the same scope as the case label or the
goto label. Thus, there is a chance that the initialization will not occur.
There are ways to ensure that the initialization is performed:

 - Enclose the for loop in "{}" (curly braces). This will cause the for loop to
   be in a different scope than the case and goto labels.

   -or-

 - Define the loop variable right before entering the loop. This works only for
   simple types, not for user-defined types.

   -or-

 - Define the variable without initializing it. Any assignments made to that
   variable after its definition are considered assignments, not
   initializations.

Sample Code 1
-------------

   #include <stdio.h>

   /* Compile Options needed: none.
   */ 

   void main( void )
   {
     int var;

     switch( var )
     {
       case 1 : for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
                {
                   printf("In loop");
                }
                break;

       case 2 : printf("Case 2");            // C2360
                break;

       default : printf("Default");          // C2361
                 break;
     }
   }

Sample Code 2
-------------

   #include <stdio.h>

   /* Compile options needed: none.
   */ 

   void main (void)
   {
      goto label;

      int var = 0;

      label:;                                // C2362
   }
