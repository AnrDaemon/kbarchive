TITLE   :Err Msg: Cannot Start Windows in Standard Mode (Low Memory)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows may display the following error messages when available XMS
memory is below the requirement for standard mode and a UMB provider (for
example, EMM386.EXE) is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   Cannot Start Windows in Standard Mode

   Make sure you are not running other protected-mode software or try starting
   Windows in 386 Enhanced mode by typing WIN /3.

After typing "win /3" (without the quotation marks), the following message is
displayed:

   Insufficient extended memory available to run Windows

   Quit one or more applications to increase available memory or restart your
   computer.

CAUSE
=====

Standard mode Windows 3.1 is VCPI-compliant. VCPI is an industry protocol to
allow 386-based memory managers such as EMM386 to coexist with 286- protected
mode MS-DOS extenders. However, under low-memory situations where available XMS
is less than the Windows 3.1 standard mode requirement, UMB providers (for
example, EMM386) cause Windows to generate the above error message.

Specifically with MS-DOS or the Windows 3.1 EMM386, the error message only
appears with the NOEMS switch (and DOS=UMB). When EMM386 is loaded with either
the RAM switch (to also provide expanded memory) or with no switch (to only
provide expanded memory), Windows 3.1 will execute in standard mode.

To avoid this (low memory) error message, Windows will need more available XMS
memory. If drivers for an external disk cache and/or RAMDrive are loaded, either
reduce the extended memory allocated to these drivers or remove them entirely.
