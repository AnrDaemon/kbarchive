For the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 version 3.0, a new log file is
created every day. The name of the log file is taken from the date of
the X.400 gateway workstation and is in the format X400mmdd.LOG, where
"mm" represents the month and "dd: represents the day.

The X.400 gateway log file is activated by using the command-line
option "-LV". The log file is opened in the LOG subdirectory of the
gateway home postoffice.

In earlier software releases, the gateway composes and writes to only
one log file: X400.LOG
