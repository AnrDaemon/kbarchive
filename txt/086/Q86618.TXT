SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows version 3.1 user-defined paper sizes for the NEC Pinwriter
P5XL printer do not support 14-by-11-inch paper.

To work around this problem, NEC recommends emulating the Epson LQ-2550, Epson
LQ-2500, or the Epson LQ-1500 printer.

Each of these Epson drivers offers a width range of [100-1400] and a length range
of [100-2200], where the unit is 0.01 inch. However, only the Epson LQ-2550 and
Epson LQ-2500 can print colors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The user-defined paper sizes option for the NEC Pinwriter P5XL Windows version
3.1 printer driver provides a width range of [100 850], and a length range of
[100-9102], where the unit is 0.01 inch.

This range does not offer the 14-inch width that was offered by the printer
driver for Windows version 3.0, which offered a maximum paper size of 14-by-11
inches.
