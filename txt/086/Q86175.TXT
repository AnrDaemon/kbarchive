-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run MS-DOS Prompt under Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups in
386 enhanced mode on a Novell network, you may lose your environment parameters.
You can view your MS-DOS environment settings by issuing the SET command at the
MS-DOS command prompt before you start Windows, or at the MS-DOS Prompt under
Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are losing your MS-DOS environment variables, use the following
troubleshooting steps to ensure a consistent MS-DOS environment:

1. Make sure the correct Novell NetWare drivers are selected in Windows Setup.
   There are five NetWare selections under Windows 3.1 Setup:

   Novell NetWare (shell versions 3.21 and above)
   Novell NetWare (shell versions 3.26 and above)
   Novell NetWare (shell versions below 3.01)
   Novell NetWare (shell versions below 3.21)
   Novell NetWare 2.10 or above, or Novell NetWare 386

   To check which shell version you are currently using, issue the following
   command at the MS-DOS command prompt (you must be logged onto the network to
   issue this command):

   NETX I

   -or-

   NVER

   NOTE: If you are using NetWare version 3.32 (released for MS-DOS 6 support),
   use NETX.

2. Verify that the VIPX.386 file is located in the Windows/SYSTEM directory.

3. Ensure that the COMSPEC environmental variable is being set correctly in the
   CONFIG.SYS file. The following line should be present in the CONFIG.SYS
   file:

         SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\ /e:2048 /p

   NOTE: The above line assumes that the COMMAND.COM file is located in the
   C:\DOS directory.

4. Update the NETX and IPX to the most recent version. Windows version 3.1
   supplies NETX.COM version 3.26 and an IPX.OBJ file that you can use to
   generate a Windows 3.1 compatible version of IPX.COM. Be sure to select

   Novell NetWare (shell versions 3.26 and above)

   in the Windows Setup.

5. Update any supporting Novell files such as LOGIN.EXE to the most current
   version available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS environment can also be lost or garbled if multiple protocols are
installed on a single workstation. For example, a workstation might have drivers
for the IBM DOS LAN Requester network and drivers for Novell NetWare installed.
This allows the workstation to access both OS/2 LAN Servers and Novell NetWare
servers. However, if the Windows Setup is configured for "IBM OS/2 Lan Server"
instead of "Novell NetWare (shell version)", then the DOS environment will be
lost or garbled when you run MS-DOS Prompt from Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

To correct this problem, make sure that the Novell NetWare drivers are loading,
and that the LAN Server drivers are not. The Windows NetWare drivers need to be
loaded for the Novell Network to run properly in 386 enhanced mode Windows.
