-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
    - the operating system: Mac OS 9.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

All Microsoft Mail for PC Networks clients are compatible with version 2.x
postoffices; however, the clients are not compatible with version 1.x
postoffices. If the Macintosh or MS-DOS client is run against a version 2.x
postoffice, the client will issue a warning message on startup and then proceeds
to the login display.

For the Macintosh client, the message is:

   The version of your postoffice is older than the Macintosh client you are
   running. Please notify your administrator.

For the MS-DOS client, the message is:

   Postoffice version is older than this program version. Notify administrator.

NOTE: If the version 3.0 Mail program is run against a version 2.x postoffice
without the version 3.0 MS-DOS client Install program being run on that
postoffice, the following error message is displayed:

   Cannot access server error file: ENGMAI.GLB

This message means that the MS-DOS version 3.0 error file is not installed on
that postoffice.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.00a postoffice
