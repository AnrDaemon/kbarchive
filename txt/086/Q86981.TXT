The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) is a new feature in version 3.0 Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks. Directory synchronization allows user lists to be
propagated among Microsoft Mail systems.

Dir-Sync works between Microsoft Mail systems that are using version 3.0 of the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 as the backbone. When the Microsoft Mail
External postoffice is defined in the EXTERNAL-ADMIN section of the Mail
Administrator program as being indirect via the X.400 gateway, the mail system
tries to export the user lists to the other postoffice.

You must perform the normal setup procedures for defining the routing and
addressing information for the gateway before the file transfer can be
successful.
