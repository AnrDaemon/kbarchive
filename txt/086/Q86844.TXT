TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Calendar File Must Be Available for Reminders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows will not bring up reminders if it
cannot access either the postoffice calendar file or the locally stored calendar
file. It will bring up these reminders that should have been displayed when
either of these files becomes available.

CAUSE
=====

When you work offline, Schedule+ uses the local file to store tasks,
appointments, and reminders. You can move the local calendar file via the File
menu to a disk for use on a home or portable computer, or to a network drive to
save hard disk space locally. If that disk is removed from the drive or if that
server is disconnected from your computer while Schedule+ is running offline,
the reminders stored on it will not appear until the disk is returned to the
drive, the network drive is re-attached, or you sign back into Mail and work
online. Schedule+ will alert you if this file is unavailable when you create or
modify reminders, events, or tasks; when you exit; and when you switch between
working offline and working online.
