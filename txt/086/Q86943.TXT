The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the 3Com 3+Mail and 3+Name services, and the format of
3+Mail addresses.

3+Mail
------

3+Mail is a service that runs on 3Com networks, and is provided as part of the
network operating system. Users log into the mail service, which provides
messaging capabilities and folders. The full three-part name of the mail service
must be provided when installing the gateway.

3+Name
------

The 3+Name service is the program that allows the creation of IDs on the 3Com
network. The _GATEWAY ID is created by the installation program, using this
service, and can be modified using the installation program.

Addressing
----------

A 3Com address is structured as user@domain:organization, where "user" is the
mailbox ID of the 3Com user. "Domain:organization" can be any string, usually
used to logically identify a group or area of the network (similar to Internet).
The installation program asks for the domain:organization the _GATEWAY user will
be created in. This must be unique on the network because it is used to route
mail for Microsoft Mail users.
