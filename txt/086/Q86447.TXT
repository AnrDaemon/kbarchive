 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows does not support bidirectional printing on dot-matrix
printers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you print graphics or TrueType fonts to a dot-matrix printer that uses
bidirectional printing, you receive jagged lines and/or characters as output.
TrueType fonts and graphics require a high degree of precision; current printer
implementations of bidirectional printing are not capable of this precision.

If you are using an unsupported dot-matrix printer emulating a supported printer,
you may need to disable the printer's hardware implementation of bidirectional
printing in order to produce quality output.
