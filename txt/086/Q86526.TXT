SUMMARY
=======

If you use Hewlett-Packard (HP) Scanning Gallery version 5.0 with Microsoft
Windows version 3.1, you may encounter the following problems:

 - General protection (GP) faults

 - When you are running in 386 enhanced mode, Windows may unexpectedly exit to
   the MS-DOS command prompt

Microsoft recommends that you use HP DeskScan II version 1.51 software when you
are using HP ScanJet and ScanJet Plus scanners with Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP DeskScan II version 1.51 upgrade provides the following functionality:

 - TWAIN compliance (the industry standard protocol for scanning and acquiring
   graphics from software applications)

 - AutoFind (this automatically finds the image on the scanned page)

 - AutoImage (this detects whether the image is color or black and white, and
   whether it is a drawing or photograph)

 - Windows 3.1 compatibility for both 386 enhanced and standard modes

Scan Gallery version 5.0 works with both the ScanJet and the ScanJet Plus
scanners. Earlier versions of Scan Gallery work in real-mode Windows 3.0 only.

The products included here are manufactured by Hewlett-Packard, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
