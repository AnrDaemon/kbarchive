======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ReachOut, by Ocean Isle Software, lets you remotely control (via modem) a PC
running MS-DOS or Windows. However, if you use ReachOut with Microsoft Windows
version 3.1, you may not be able to remotely control a PC running Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to Ocean Isle, you can correct this problem by remarking out all
references to COM ports in the [386 Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. This
can be done by placing a semicolon (;) at the beginning of each COMx= line, as
in the following example:

      [386Enh]
      ;COM1Base=03F8
      ;Com1AutoAssign=2
      ;COM1Irq=4

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unlike Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1 will add ComxBase= and ComxIrq= lines to the
SYSTEM.INI file with the appropriate default COM port values if you choose the
OK button when exiting from the Advanced Settings dialog box. As a result, when
Windows 3.1 is started, it will re-initialize the specified port.
Re-initializing the port when starting Windows will break the connection to the
modem and ReachOut.

To change the advanced port settings:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Ports icon.

3. Choose the Settings button.

4. Choose the Advanced button.

Choosing the OK button will update the SYSTEM.INI file. If the ComxBase= and
ComxIrq= lines are not already in the [386 Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file,
they will be added, even if you do not change the port settings from Default.
