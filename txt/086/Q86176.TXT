Disable the color option, and then turn the printer off and on again.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in EPSON24.DRV version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION

The LQ-2550, using the EPSON24.DRV version 1.0, can print color from
