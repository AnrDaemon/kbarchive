SUMMARY
=======

The WW0548.EXE file contains a revised Windows WIN87EM.DLL file. You must be
using Windows version 3.1 to use this dynamic-link library (DLL) file. If you
have a version of Windows earlier than 3.1, you do not need to replace your
current WIN87EM.DLL file. You also do not need to replace your WIN87EM.DLL file
unless you are using the Intel 80387 math coprocessor. The Intel 80486DX and
80486DX2 processors do not require the new file.

Installation
