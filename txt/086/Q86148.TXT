SUMMARY
=======

There is no easy way to check the mail "queue" on the VM side of the gateway, as
is possible on the local area network (LAN). However, there are two files you
can monitor to see whether mail is moving through the gateway.

PROFSIN CSI is the incoming mailbag for the Microsoft Mail Host Access component.
This is the file that is created when the PROFSOUT.DAT file is uploaded from the
LAN to the gateway VM ID. The size of this file will vary, depending on the
number of messages, but it should always be a multiple of 80 bytes.

PROFSOUT $MESSAGE is the outgoing mailbag for the Host Access component. This is
the file that contains mail items for delivery to the LAN. The size of the file
will vary; however, it should always be a multiple of 80 bytes. When downloaded
to the LAN, the file is renamed PROFSOUT.DAT.
