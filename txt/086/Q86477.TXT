The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows versions 3.0, 3.1 
 - Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK), versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows help files (.HLP files) can be written such that selecting a designated
topic executes a Windows-based application. This is done with the ExecProgram()
macro. If the desired application does not reside in the same directory as the
.HLP file, a full path to the .EXE must be specified. An invalid path produces
an error.

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to execute an application with a full path causes Windows to display
the following Help message box:

   Unable to Run Specified File.

CAUSE
=====

A common mistake is to incorrectly specify the subdirectory delimiters in the
path description.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Windows Help Compiler can recognize escape sequences expressed using the
backslash (\) character. When using the ExecProgram() macro, four backslashes
(\\\\) separate each directory in a full path description:

   ExecProgram( "c:\\\\winapps\\\\excel\\\\excel", 0 )

With HC31.EXE version 3.10.505, you would use only two backslashes:

   ExecProgram( "c:\\winapps\\excel\\excel", 0 )

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 4.00 95
