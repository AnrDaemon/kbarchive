KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 1.0 and 1.02 of Cakewalk Professional for Windows may cause a general
protection (GP) fault in module WINCAKE.EXE.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when a .CAL program is missing a parenthesis.

Versions 1.0 and 1.02 of Cakewalk Professional for Windows contain a programming
language called CAL, which allows simple tasks to be repeated over a range of
MIDI events.

If a .CAL program is missing a closing parenthesis, WINCAKE.EXE might cause a GP
fault instead of reporting a syntax error.

This problem has been confirmed by Twelve Tone Systems in version 1.0 and 1.02 of
Cakewalk Professional for Windows. This may be corrected in a future version of
Cakewalk Professional.
