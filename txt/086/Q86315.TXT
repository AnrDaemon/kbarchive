PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the folder hierarchy
display can become incorrect after you drag-and-drop folders from the top level
to a lower level two or more times in succession. Scrolling the list up or down
corrects the display.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail for Windows
versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here is an example of the problem.

NOTE: MCV stands for the Message Center Viewer window that displays your folders
and messages.

Beginning Folder Hierarchy
--------------------------

+Current
 Inbox         <-- This is open
+Mine
-Misc
 
   Competit
   Discuss
   Intl        <-- This is the top folder in view in the MCV
   Network
 
  -Software
 
     Applications
     Misc
     PCMail
     PenWin
 
   Stuff
   UI
 
 SentMail
 Wastebasket
+WinBall
 yyPorthole
 yyProject
 yyVisBasic
 yyWinWord     <-- This is the bottom folder in view in the MCV
+zArchive

Grab "yyPorthole" and drag it up to the folder "Software" and drop it. It is
moved correctly. Next, grab "yyProject" and drag it up to "Software" and drop
it. The MCV now displays:
