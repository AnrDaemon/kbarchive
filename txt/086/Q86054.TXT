SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines a method to determine the amount of extended memory
installed on a computer using the MS-DOS DEBUG utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The amount of contiguous extended memory identified by software Interrupt 15,
function 88 (Int 15H/88H, get extended memory size) is the amount that HIMEM.SYS
uses to allocate XMS. In versions of MS-DOS earlier than 4.01, a utility was not
provided to display the amount of memory on a computer. To determine how much
extended memory is installed in a computer, do the following:

1. Remove any memory managers from the CONFIG.SYS file, including HIMEM.SYS.

2. Reboot the computer.

3. At an MS-DOS command prompt, type "DEBUG" (without the quotation marks).

4. When the DEBUG command prompt (a hyphen, [-]) is displayed, enter the DEBUG
   commands below:

   DEBUG       Enter DEBUG
   Prompts     Commands            Comments
   -------     -----------         --------

   -           A 100               Assemble from CS:0100.
   nnnn:0100   MOV AX, 8800        Set AX reg. for function 8800
                                (nnnn is segment address)
   nnnn:0103   INT 15              Call Interrupt 15
   nnnn:0105   <Press Enter>
   -           P 2                 Debug Proceed instruction
                                to execute interrupt request.

   Information similar to the following will appear:

   AX=8800  BX=0000  CX=0000  DX=0000  SP=FFEE  BP=0000  SI=0000  DI=0000
   DS=1D5B  ES=1D5B  SS=1D5B  CS=1D5B  IP=0102   NV UP EI PL NZ NA PO NC
   1D5B:0102 CD15          INT     15

   AX=1D80  BX=0000  CX=0000  DX=0000  SP=FFEE  BP=0000  SI=0000  DI=0000
   DS=1D5B  ES=1D5B  SS=1D5B  CS=1D5B  IP=0104   NV UP EI PL NZ NA PO NC
   1D5B:0104 7E12          JLE     0118

   -           Q                        Quit Debug

The returned information is a dump of the CPU registers after each instruction.
The AX register of the second dump contains the hexadecimal value for the amount
of extended memory on the system. In the above example, AX=1D80. The hexadecimal
value 1D80 is 7552 in decimal. Multiply the decimal number by 1024 to obtain the
bytes available contiguous extended memory. In this example:

   7552 * 1024 = 7733248 bytes total contiguous extended memory
