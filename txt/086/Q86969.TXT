-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To test the X.25 connection before installing the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
X.400, perform these steps:

1. NA TEST: To test the Eicon Card hardware parameters, jumper settings, and
   perform a complete set of hardware diagnostics on the Eicon card, use the NA
   TEST feature that comes with the Eicon card.

2. Access software: The access software uses a protocol called ITI (Interactive
   Terminal Interface), which allows for the transfer of binary files between
   terminals across an X.25 network, for a test of file transfers and general
   X.25 network operation. Set up and perform this test before you install the
   X.400 gateway.
