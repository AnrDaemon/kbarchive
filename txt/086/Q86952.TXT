SUMMARY
=======

If it becomes necessary to shut down the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail,
you must delete all files from the MFFPUT, MFFGET, and 3C-OUT directories before
restarting. These are the temporary files that are being transmitted between
Microsoft Mail and 3+Mail. Deleting these files ensures that the gateway will
start cleanly.
