SUMMARY
=======

The Magnavox Metalis 386SX is a notebook computer that uses Power Management
(PM), instead of Advanced Power Management (APM). Microsoft Windows 3.1 supports
APM. The Metalis cannot be set up for APM because it only supports the PM
standard.

You can use 32-bit disk access on the Magnavox notebook providing you completely
disable PM in the CMOS. If you use 32-bit disk access without first disabling
PM, your hard drive may shut down while you use Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Disabling PM decreases the battery life; however, if you use an AC adapter, you
don't need PM. 32-bit-disk access adds considerable speed to the SX machine.

NOTE: 32-bit disk access is only available for WD-1003 compatible hard-disk
controllers. Hard-disk controllers in most portables are very similar to Western
Digital controllers but have extensions for power management.

For further information on how to disable Power Management, contact Magnavox.
