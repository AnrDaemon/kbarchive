To reset the Typematic Rate in MS-DOS (versions 4.01 and 5.0), type the
following at the MS-DOS command prompt

   mode con: rate=r delay=d

where r is in the range 1 through 32, with a default value of 20 or 21 depending
on your keyboard, and d is in the range 1 through 4, with the default value 2.
