SUMMARY

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 occupies the top four levels of the OSI
software stack: application, presentation, session, and transport. This leaves
the lower three levels available for transporting from point to point.

The lower three levels can range from X.25, TP4, TP0, TCP/IP, IPX, and so forth;
however, only the X.25 packet protocol is currently supported.
