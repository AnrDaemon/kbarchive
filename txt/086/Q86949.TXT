The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To trace problems with the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, you need this
information:

 - The version of the gateway (should be 3.0, build #10)

 - The version of 3+Share or 3+Open

 - What network drivers are being loaded

 - Any error messages encountered

In most cases, to get the gateway working again, you can simply delete all the
temporary files in the MFFPUT, MFFGET, and 3C-OUT directories. Once this is
done, you can restart the gateway.
