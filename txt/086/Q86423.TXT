SUMMARY
=======

When modifying the [group#] section of the SETUP.INF file in Windows version
3.1, it is not possible to modify the working directory property for an
application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SETUP.INF file can be modified to install a customized version of Windows on
multiple machines. It is possible to change the default Program Manager groups,
create other groups, and add applications to these new groups.

The [group#] section of the SETUP.INF (where # is the number of the group) is
used to list applications that belong in a group. There are entries for
description, FILENAME.EXE, icon filename, icon n, and profile, but no entry for
working directory.

The following is an example of the SETUP.INF [group#] section:

[group4]
"Write",            WRITE.EXE
"Paintbrush",       PBRUSH.EXE,,,                      pbrush
"Terminal",         TERMINAL.EXE,,,                    terminal
"Notepad",          NOTEPAD.EXE,,,                     notepad
