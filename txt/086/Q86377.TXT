PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows can send meeting requests to any user in the
global address list. However, replies from some gateways may not be visible in
the Schedule+ Messages window.

CAUSE
=====

This is a function of the gateway.

STATUS
======

This feature in gateways is under review and will be considered for inclusion in
future releases of the gateways.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Gateways that are aware of Schedule+ can convert Schedule+ messages to their
foreign system equivalent, and can convert the replies from a foreign scheduling
program to Schedule+ messages. If a gateway is not Schedule+ aware or it does
not recognize the foreign Schedule+ message type, then the message will be
delivered in a standard note message to the Inbox of the Windows Mail client.

For more information on Schedule+ aware gateways, check with your Microsoft
Messaging Specialist.
