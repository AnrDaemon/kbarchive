The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Future Trend's EZSound FX version 2.0 with Microsoft Windows you
are able to play some, but not all, of the sample sounds if you are using a PRO
Audio Spectrum 16 or PDPC sound card.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Edit the SFSOUND.INI files with a standard ASCII text editor, such as
   Notepad.

2. Add the following line to the [FM] section:

   OPL3=Yes

EZSound FX is an application that adds additional sound functionality to
Microsoft Windows. This includes playing WAV, MID, VOC, ROL, and several other
sound formats.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PRO Audio Spectrum 16 and PDPC sound cards use the Yamaha OPL3 sound chip
instead of the Yamaha YN1812. This chip may not identify itself as an OPL3
because it is backwards compatible with the YN1812. The OPL3=Yes switch forces
the software to override this problem.

The EZSound included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
