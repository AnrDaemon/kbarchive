SUMMARY
=======

The only way to de-install the VM side of the gateway is to erase all the files
from the Gateway VM ID's disks.

Normally, the Microsoft Mail Host Access component would be on the 191 A disk and
the 193 F disk. If installed, the Distribution Manager (DM) files would normally
reside on the 194 E disk. Under CMS, these files could be deleted using the
ERASE command, or the disks could be reformatted.
