-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Terminal will automatically substitute letters with numbers when you choose the
Dial command from the Phone menu. This feature may be desirable when you dial a
phone number that includes letters, but does not allow "AT" commands to be sent
when auto dialing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If letters are included in the Phone Number setting in Terminal (TERMINAL.EXE),
they will be replaced by the corresponding numbers found on a traditional
touch-tone phone dialing pad.

Terminal is a modem communications program included with Windows 3.0, 3.0a, and
3.1. In some cases, it may be desirable to insert "AT" modem commands into the
dialing string to activate certain features of a Hayes or Hayes compatible modem
when dialing. With Terminal, these letters are transformed into numbers.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. From the Settings menu in Terminal, choose Phone Number.

2. Enter "ATV1,555-1212" (without the quotation marks) in the Dial text box.
   ATV1 instructs the modem to give result codes in English instead of numbers.
   The "," instructs the modem to pause two seconds before proceeding.

3. Press ENTER to return to Terminal.

4. From the Phone menu bar, choose Dial.

A Terminal dialog box will appear, displaying:

   Dialing:ATV1,555-1212

However, Terminal will actually dial "2881,555-1212" instead because "2"
corresponds to "A" and "8" corresponds to the letters "T" and "V".

For letters that do not have a corresponding letter on the phone pad (Q and Z),
Terminal substitutes a dash for the letter when it sends the dialing string to
the modem. Dashes are ignored by the modem.

To send AT commands to the modem while dialing:

1. From the Settings menu, choose Modem Commands.

2. Type "AT" (without the quotation marks) in the Prefix box.

The following letters correspond to the number on a traditional touch tone phone
pad:

   ABC=2
   DEF=3
   GHI=4
   JKL=5
   MNO=6
   PRS=7
   TUV=8
   WXY=9
