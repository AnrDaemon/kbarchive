TITLE   :PRB: Special Characters Missing from Compiled Help File
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits
PROD/VER::3.1; WINDOWS:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK), versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 2.0 of Microsoft Word for Windows, the RTF (rich-text format) source
file for a Microsoft Windows Help file contains curly (smart) single or double
quotation marks, bullets, or em or en dash characters. However, even though the
specified font contains these special characters, they are missing when the
compiled file is viewed in Help.

CAUSE
=====

Word for Windows stores special RTF tokens for these characters, which the
Microsoft Windows Help Compiler cannot process.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to avoid these problems do one of the following:

 - Format the character to use the Symbol font (without using Insert.Symbol).

-or-

 - Sellect the desired font (not Symbol) and choose the Symbol option from the
   Insert menu. Then choose Normal Text in the Symbols From list box. This will
   format the special character in the desired font.

-or-

 - Use a bitmap to represent the character or symbol. Use the "bmc" statement to
   include the bitmap into the text as a character. For more information on the
   bmc statement, see page 29 of the "Programming Tools" manual provided with
   version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows SDK.
