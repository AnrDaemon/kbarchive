SUMMARY
=======

Here is a description of the actions the Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail
performs during the cycle of checking for mail messages:

1. The gateway checks the 3Com 3+Mail database for mail addressed to the
   _GATEWAY user.

2. If mail is found, the gateway transfers the mail items to the MFFPUT
   directory.

3. The gateway processes each item in the MFFPUT directory, building an FFAPI
   compatible file.

4. The gateway spawns COURPUT.EXE to submit files to the mail database.

5. The gateway checks the Microsoft Mail database for mail to 3Com 3+Mail.

6. COURGET.EXE is spawned. Mail items are extracted from the mailbag and put
   into MFFGET directory.

7. The items are processed and put into the mailbags of users in the 3+Mail
   database.
