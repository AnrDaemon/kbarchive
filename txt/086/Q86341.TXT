SYMPTOMS
========

While running Setup for Windows version 3.1, you may receive the following error
message if the WIN.INI file in the WINDOWS directory has a file size of zero
bytes:

   Setup Error #S020. Setup is unable to make changes to the Windows
   configuration file, SYSTEM.INI. This may be due to one or both of the
   following reasons.

 - Your system does not have the minimum conventional memory required to set up
   Windows. (See your Setup documentation for memory requirements.)

 - Your SYSTEM.INI file is unusually large (above 32K)

   Setup cannot continue. You must quit Setup, free some memory, and then run
   Setup again.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete or rename the WIN.INI file in the Windows directory and run Windows Setup
again.
