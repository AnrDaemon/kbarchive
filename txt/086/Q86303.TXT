======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Windows version 3.1 Media Player and attempt to play a MIDI
file with the Roland MPU401, you may receive the following error message:

   There are no MIDI devices installed on the system. Use the Drivers option in
   Control Panel to install the driver.

CAUSE
=====

This message can be caused because the MIDI driver is not installed properly or
the MIDIMAP.CFG is corrupt or missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install the MIDI driver, start Control Panel, choose the Drivers icon, and
then select and install the driver.

If your MIDI driver is installed, run Control Panel MIDI Mapper to determine if
your MIDIMAP.CFG file is corrupt or missing. If MIDI Mapper displays the
following error message, then the MIDIMAP.CFG is corrupt or missing:

   MIDI Mapper could not find a valid MIDIMAP.CFG file in your Windows SYSTEM
   directory. It cannot run without this file. Do you want to create and
   initialize a new MIDIMAP.CFG file?

If this message is displayed, do not allow Windows to rebuild the MIDIMAP.CFG
because MIDIMAP.CFG will have limited functionality. Instead, use the Windows
EXPAND.EXE program to install a working copy of MIDIMAP.CFG from the origional
Windows floppy disks, as follows.

   expand a:\midimap.cf_ c:\windows\system\midimap.cfg

NOTE: This command does not work on a network (/A) configuration. This command
looks for the system directory.

MIDIMAP.CF_ is located on disk 4 of the 1.44-MB disks, and disk 6 on the 1.2-MB
disks.
