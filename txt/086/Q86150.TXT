SUMMARY
=======

XEDIT is the standard file editing program available to VM/CMS users on the
mainframe. It is spawned by many of the Microsoft Mail Host Access component
programs, and the VM administrator can also use it to edit configuration files
manually.

To edit a file with XEDIT, type:

   " XEDIT <fn> <ft> <fm> " (without the quotation marks)

where <fn> is the filename, <ft> is the file type, and <fm> is
the file mode. For example, to edit the file PWANODES DATA on the gateway's 191
A disk, you would type the following, then press ENTER:

   " XEDIT PWANODES DATA A " (without the quotation marks)

When XEDIT opens the file, a list of the PF key commands is displayed at the
bottom of the screen. To get further help for the XEDIT program, type "HELP
XEDIT" (without the quotation marks) at the CMS prompt.
