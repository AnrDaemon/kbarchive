 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the Microsoft Mail gateway VM ID is logged off automatically, the LAN side
will not be able to communicate and will subsequently exit to MS-DOS.

The VM administrator should make sure that the gateway VM ID is not included on
the list of IDs that will be automatically logged off of VM because of
inactivity. Also, make sure the gateway VM ID does not load any "screen saver"
software, which would blank the host session screen. This prevents the LAN side
gateway program from "reading" the host session screen.
