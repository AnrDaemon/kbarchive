The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the VM side of the gateway appears to no longer be communicating with the LAN
side, the administrator should use the Gateway PC to hot key to the host session
to check the status.

If the VM side of the gateway is "alive," either PROFS:IDLE or PROFS:READY should
be displayed on the screen. If not, you can restart the VM side by typing:

   " HX
   IPL CMS " (without the quotation marks)

Or, if you are already in CMS, type:

   " PROFILE EXEC " (without the quotation marks)

The gateway should eventually come up with the PROFS:IDLE or PROFS:READY prompt.
Once this has happened, you should hot key back to MS-DOS and restart the
HostDisp program.
