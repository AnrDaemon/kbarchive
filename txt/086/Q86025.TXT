SUMMARY
=======

When you print Microsoft Windows version 3.1 TrueType fonts at large point sizes
greater than 90 point to early model Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet series II
printers or compatibles, you may need to select the Print TrueType Fonts As
Graphics option from the Control Panel Printers option.

This problem is caused by a BIOS limitation in early model LaserJet II printers
and some compatibles. Fonts smaller than 80 or 90 point do not require the Print
TrueType Fonts As Graphics option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Select Print TrueType Fonts As Graphics
------------------------------------------------

1. Run the Control Panel and choose Printers.

2. Choose Setup and Options.

3. Select the Print TrueType As Graphics check box.
