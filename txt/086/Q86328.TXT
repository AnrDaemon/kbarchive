-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the following error message may be
displayed if the maximum number of folders has been reached:

   The New Folder Could Not Be Created

CAUSE
=====

Several conditions determine the maximum number of folders that can be created,
but the average is around 5,000. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this
error message is being displayed because of the maximum being reached.

The following are two possible causes of this error:

 - The Mail Message File (MMF) is set to read-only.

 - The FOLDROOT.IDX file is marked read-only or, if you are on a Novell network,
   the FOLDROOT.IDX file is ownerless.
