The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1992 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Bookshelf for Windows demonstration that ships with the Multimedia Works
product is a scaled-down version of the Bookshelf product. It contains the same
basic problems that the originally shipped version of Bookshelf for Windows had.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This will be evident under Windows 3.1, where the SETUP.EXE program may fail
with the "Error writing to System Setup file" error message. To manually set up
the demonstration, do the following:

1. Copy all the files in the D:\BOOKSHLF\VIEWER directory (where D is the CD-ROM
   drive) to a newly created C:\VIEWER directory on the hard drive. Do the
   following from the MS-DOS command prompt:
   a. Type:

   "md c:\viewer" (without the quotation marks)

   b. Type

   "copy d:\bookshlf\viewer\*.* c:\viewer" (without the quotation marks)

      where d is the CD-ROM drive.

2. Add the C:\VIEWER directory to the MS-DOS Path command. This is required by
   VIEWER.EXE to locate its DLLs.

3. Optionally, install the fonts using the Control Panel fonts utility.

Note: The fonts for the demonstration are VGA resolution only.
