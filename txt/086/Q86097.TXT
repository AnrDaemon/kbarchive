SUMMARY
=======

This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail for
Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the [Mac File Types]
section.

[Mac FileTypes]

Entries in this section map Macintosh file type and creator tags to MS-DOS file
extensions. Mail uses them to determine what application to launch on a file
attachment that has been sent from a Macintosh mail client. There are two
alternative forms for the entries:

   creator:type=.extension

   or

   :type=.extension

Both the creator and type are sequences of four characters (possibly including
blanks). For example

   :TEXT=.DOC

will launch the application associated with the extension .DOC (for example, Word
for Windows) on any Macintosh file of type TEXT.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20 Mac File Types
