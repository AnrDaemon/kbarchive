-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The X.400 gateway is actually a series of modules that belong either to the
Proprietary X.400 gateway or to the 1984 standard X.400 message handling system
(MHS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

All files are stored on the server; some are data files and some are executable
files. The executable and data files include software components that are
proprietary to the mail store, proprietary to the gateway, and standard to the
X.400 message handling system. The following is an illustration:

 -------------       -------------       -------------
|             |     |             |     |             |
|  Microsoft  |<--->|  Gateway    |<--->|  X.400 MTA  |<---------->
|   Mail      |     |             |     |             | to other mail
|  Database   |     |             |     |             | systems via
 -------------       -------------       -------------  X.25

The Microsoft Mail database contains the mailbox for the gateway, forwarding
postoffices and the users for that postoffice. The message store contains the
outgoing queue. The Microsoft message store and directory services are
proprietary and are not X.400 compliant. The messages are currently in the
following mail database directories:

   MAI
   KEY
   MBG
   ATT

The gateway is the module that is defined as the process of interaction between
the Microsoft mail store and format, and submission to the 1984 X.400 standard
format. The gateway primarily changes the formats, encoding, and addressing of
the messages. The gateway is proprietary and not X.400 compliant; however, the
gateway converts messages to the X.400 compliant format and then submits the
messages to the X.400 compliant message transfer agent (MTA). The gateway uses
temporary work space to convert the message formats.

   BODYPART.CFG
   ADDRCONV.CFG
   MAPTBL.IN

The X.400 MTA is a 1984 MTA standard compliant. The ROUTE.CFG table is part of
the MTA:

   ROUTE.CFG
   OUTCNCT.CFG
   INCNCT.CFG
   MTA.CFG
   INCOMING
   OUTGOING
