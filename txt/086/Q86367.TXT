-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 is installed for a Novell
network, and then MS-DOS-based maintenance mode Setup is run and No Network
Installed is selected, then all the Novell components are removed except for the
following line in the SYSTEM.INI file's [386enh] section:

   OVERLAPPEDIO=OFF

Having this setting active when you are not running on a Novell network, may
reduce system performance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If enabled, this switch allows several virtual machines to make read and write
requests to a disk before the first request has been completed. If it is
disabled, then MS-DOS-based applications cannot issue a request to read or write
to a disk until any previous read and write requests have been completed.
