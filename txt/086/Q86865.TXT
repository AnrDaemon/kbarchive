TITLE   :Print Manager DOS Timeout: System Call Level Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

   The following information applies to Microsoft LAN Manager running under OS/2
   version 1.30.1.

   When choosing DOS Timeout from the Print Manager's Setup menu, the error
   message "The system call level is not correct" may appear.

CAUSE
=====

   If you are using Hewlett-Packard's (HP) OS/2 Network Printer Interface
   software in conjunction with Microsoft OS/2 for LAN Manager (shipped with
   Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.1), this error message is the result of a DLL
   (dynamic-link library) conflict.

RESOLUTION
==========

   Assuming a default installation of HP's software, the reference to the
   PMSPL.DLL and SPL1B.DLL files must be removed. This can be accomplished in
   one of the following two ways:

 - Change the location of any DLL necessary for the HP software to function, and
   remove any reference to the PMSPL.DLL and SPL1B.DLL files, which come with
   the HP product.

   a. Remove the C:\HPNETPRN reference in LIBPATH.

   b. Copy the language-specific DLL (HPNPENG.DLL for English) to a directory
      that is in the LIBPATH (for example, C:\OS2\DLL).

   c. Reboot the server.

   -or-

 - Remove or rename the PMSPL.DLL and SPL1B.DLL files that exist in the
   C:\HPNETPRN directory. Because these files are in use by Print Manager, it
   will be necessary to boot from a floppy disk:

   a. Boot the server from HPFS Recover Disk 1 (or Disk 2).

   b. Rename or remove the PMSPL.DLL and SPL1B.DLL files that appear in the
      C:\HPNETPRN directory.

   c. Reboot the server.
