======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Graphics Viewer 1.0 from the Windows Resource Kit for Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1 only supports 16 colors when viewing bitmap (.BMP)
files. With a 256-color driver loaded and Windows 3.1 configured properly, a
256-color .BMP file is rendered in only 16 colors.

CAUSE
=====

The Graphics Viewer (BMPVIEW.EXE) does not support File Manager's Associate
command. Therefore, you cannot associate .BMP files with this program.

Both of these limitations are by design.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 bitmap
