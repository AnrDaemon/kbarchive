SUMMARY
=======

To successfully compile source files developed for version 3.0 of the Microsoft
Windows Help Compiler with version 3.1 of the Help Compiler, make the following
two changes to the Help Project (HPJ) file:

 - In the [OPTIONS] section, replace the INDEX statement with the CONTENTS
   statement. The CONTENTS statement provides the same functionality; it
   specifies the context string of the highest-level topic. This topic is
   usually a table of contents or an index of the help file. The Windows Help
   application displays the contents topic whenever the user chooses the
   Contents button. The syntax of the CONTENTS statement is as follows:

         [OPTIONS]
         CONTENTS=context-string

 - If the Help file contains any browse sequences, add the browse buttons to the
   button bar with the following statement in the [CONFIG] section:

         [CONFIG]
         BrowseButtons()

   Version 3.1 of the Windows Help Compiler does not display the browse buttons
   by default. For more information on browse buttons, see page 28 of the
   "Programming Tools" manual included with the Microsoft Windows Software
   Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1.

Because version 3.1 of the Windows Help Compiler cannot produce backwardly
compatible help files, the files it creates are incompatible with version 3.0 of
Windows Help. However, Windows Help version 3.1 will run under Microsoft Windows
3.0 and is redistributable. See the License Agreement for the Microsoft Windows
SDK version 3.1 for information about reproducing and distributing WINHELP.EXE
with your product.
