The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 1.25, 1.27, 3.0x, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

While <constant> and [<constant>] are syntactically different (a
constant and a constant within brackets), they are semantically the same. For
example, the following statement:

      MOV ax, [100]

will move the value of 100 into ax, not the value that is at address 100.

Another example is using a constant offset in a segment override:

      MOV ax, ds:100     ; This will access the word at offset 100

      MOV ax, ds:[100]   ; This will do the same thing

Additional query words: 1.25 1.27 3.0x 4.00 5.00 5.10 6.00 6.00a 6.00b
