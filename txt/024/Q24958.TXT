SUMMARY
=======

With the Microsoft Macro Assembler, a hexadecimal number must begin with a digit
between zero and nine. This is so that the assembler can distinguish between
something that should be a number and something that should be a label.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assembling the following code will result in the following errors, since the
assembler will assume that ABh is a label

   MASM 5.0, 5.1: error A2009: Symbol not defined: ABh
   MASM 6.0: error A2006: undefined symbol: ABh

Sample Code
-----------

   ;Assemble options needed: none

      .model small
      .code

         mov ax, ABh

       end
