SUMMARY
=======

There are two methods of coding a jump to an absolute address. These methods are
as follows:

1. Use AT to create a segment template beginning at an absolute address. Then,
   using ORG, a label can be assigned at a specific offset.

-or-

2. Initialize a double word variable to the specific address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code demonstrates both methods:

   ; Assembly options needed: none

   ASEG SEGMENT BYTE AT 0000H

              ORG 100
   far_label  LABEL FAR

   ASEG       ENDS

   DATA   SEGMENT WORD 'DATA'

   FAR_VAR DW   100,0

   DATA         ENDS

   CODE   SEGMENT BYTE 'CODE'
          ASSUME CS:CODE, DS:DATA

   start: mov ax, data
          mov ds, ax

          JMP far_label          ;This is the first type of jump.

          JMP DWORD PTR far_var  ;This is the second type of jump.
   CODE   ENDS

   END start
