When clearing the "ImageList" property of a ToolBar control, the ToolBar buttons
unexpectedly shrink to a very small size.

Switching the application in and out of run-mode, or resetting the ImageList
property will cause the ToolBar buttons to revert to the correct size.

beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Choose Components from the Project menu, check "Microsoft Windows Common
   Controls 6.0," and click OK.

3. Add a ToolBar and an ImageList control to Form1.

4. View the ImageList's custom property page and select the "Images" tab.

5. Click "Insert Picture," select one or more files from a folder under the
   Icons folder, such as "Arw01dn.ico," and click "OK."

6. View the ToolBar's custom property page.

7. Set the "ImageList" property to "ImageList1."

8. Click the "Buttons" tab and insert a button. Set this button's "Image"
   property to "1" and click "Apply."

9. Switch back to the "General" tab, set the "ImageList" property to
   "<None>," and click "Apply." The button and the ToolBar shrink to a
   very small size when no change in size was expected.
