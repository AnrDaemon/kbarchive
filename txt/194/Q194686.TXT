TITLE   :X400: Error 58 Message Displayed and Connection Ends
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a message to a foreign system through the Microsoft
Mail Gateway to X.400, an Error 58 message may be displayed and the connection
may end unexpectedly. When this occurs, the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
repeatedly attempts to send the message again. Each time, the error message is
displayed, and the connection ends unexpectedly. However, the original message
and all subsequent messages are successfully sent to the foreign system. Note
that this problem is known to occur with ISODE/OpenPath systems.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the foreign system sends a "please token" session
protocol data unit (SPDU) in a different transport protocol data unit (TPDU)
than the "activity end" SPDU. The Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 does not
properly handle this type of communication.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.
