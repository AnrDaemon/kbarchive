TITLE   :PRB: Treeview Node Visible Property Still True When Not Viewable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a node of a Treeview control is scrolled out of view, the Visible property
of the node is still True.

CAUSE
=====

The Visible property of the node indicates that the node is open and visible as
part of the tree. It does not indicate if it is viewable in the viewport.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Select Components from the Project menu. Check the box for "Windows Common
   Controls," and click OK.

3. Add a Treeview control to Form1.

4. Double-click on Form1 to bring up the code window and add the following code
   to Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Load()
             TreeView1.Width = 2200   ' so that node 4 is unseen
             TreeView1.Indentation = 750
             TreeView1.Nodes.Add , , , "Node1"
             TreeView1.Nodes.Add 1, tvwChild, , "Node1-1"
             TreeView1.Nodes.Add 2, tvwChild, , "Node1-1-1"
             TreeView1.Nodes.Add 3, tvwChild, , "Node1-1-1-1"
             TreeView1.Nodes(1).Expanded = True
             TreeView1.Nodes(2).Expanded = True
             TreeView1.Nodes(3).Expanded = True
             DoEvents
             Debug.Print TreeView1.Nodes(4).Visible
         End Sub

5. Run the project. Note that Node 4's Visible property is True even though the
   node is not visible through the viewport.
