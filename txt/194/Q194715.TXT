TITLE   :Oracle Diagnostic Tool Missing After Installing Service Pack 4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbservicepack

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 on a DEC Alpha-based computer,
the Testoraclexaconfig.exe diagnostic tool is not copied to the
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder. However, when you install the service pack on an
Intel-based computer, the file is automatically copied during the Setup process.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are installing the service pack on an Alpha-based computer and you are
using Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) or Distributed Transaction Coordinator
(DTC) with an Oracle or XA-compliant database, copy the Testoraclexaconfig.exe
file from the Service Pack 4 CD-ROM to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

The Testoraclexaconfig.exe file is located in the root folder on the Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 4 CD-ROM.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The optional Testoraclexaconfig.exe diagnostic tool is used to ensure that
Oracle software has been configured properly. Normally, it is used after
configuring Oracle software on an Alpha-based platform to ensure that the Oracle
configuration is correct.
