TITLE   :PRB: SETUP.EXE File Linked to Missing Export OLEAUT32.DLL:185
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbAppSetup kbVBp600 kbOSWin95 kbOSWin98 kbGrpDSVB kbOSWinME

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running a setup program that was created using the Package and Deployment
Wizard (PDW), you receive the following error message:

   The SETUP.EXE file is linked to missing export OLEAUT32.DLL:185.

When you click OK, you receive the following error message, where <Path> is
the location of Setup.exe:

   <Path>\Setup.exe
   A device attached to the system is not functioning.

CAUSE
=====

Setup packages built with the Package and Deployment Wizard will not run on the
original version of Windows 95 due to lack of support for an API function in the
file Oleaut32.dll, version 2.1. The failure does not occur on later versions of
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, or any versions of Windows NT 4.0 or Windows
2000. Further, this failure does not occur if another program installation, such
as installation programs for Microsoft Office 97, Internet Explorer 3.0, or
Internet Explorer 4.0, has updated Oleaut32.dll to a newer version.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, the latest Automation files must be installed onto the
client machine before SETUP.EXE can run successfully. The latest Automation
files may be installed by using VBRUN60.EXE. VBRUN60.EXE installs the Microsoft
Visual Basic 6.0 run-time library (MSVBVM60.EXE) and updates required Automation
files used by Visual Basic 6.0 applications (including OLEAUT32.DLL).

After VBRUN60.EXE is run successfully, the SETUP.EXE program may be run to
install your Visual Basic application successfully. VBRUN60.EXE may be located
on your Visual Basic 6.0 installation CD-ROM or it may be downloaded from the
Microsoft Web Site.
