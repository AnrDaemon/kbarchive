TITLE   :Unable to Install GSNW on Windows NT Server 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) on your Windows NT
Server, you may receive the following error:

   Please remove any existing Gateway Service for NetWare component and
   reboot your machine before installing the latest version of GSNW.

No GSNW, SAP, or RIP for IPX components are installed on the system.

CAUSE
=====

Some registry entries from the Novell intraNetWare Client are conflicting with
GSNW installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

GSNW and the intraNetWare Client do not work together. If you choose to have
GSNW, remove intraNetWare and then install GSNW.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

If intraNetWare has already been removed and the problem continues, remove the
following entries in the registry before reinstalling GSNW:

   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetWareWorkstation

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWIP
