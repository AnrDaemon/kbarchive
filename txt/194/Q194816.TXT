SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the functionality of the Auto-Rudder feature in Combat
Flight Simulator and in Combat Flight Simulator 2.

Because the functionality of the Auto-Rudder feature in Combat Flight Simulator
was improved after the Combat Flight Simulator Pilot's Manual went to press, the
description of the Auto-Rudder feature on pages 30 and 33-34 in the Combat
Flight Simulator Pilot's Manual is no longer accurate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Auto-Rudder feature in Combat Flight Simulator and in Combat Flight
Simulator 2 is designed to make your airplane easier to fly if your joystick
does not have a rudder axis or rudder pedals. When the Auto-Rudder feature is
enabled, it moves the rudder automatically when you move the ailerons.

Combat Flight Simulator and Combat Flight Simulator 2 automatically detect if
your joystick has a rudder axis or rudder pedals. If your joystick has a rudder
axis or rudder pedals, the game disables the Auto-Rudder feature. If your
joystick does not have a rudder axis or rudder pedals, the game enables the
Auto-Rudder feature.

Some air combat maneuvers may be easier to execute if you disable the Auto-Rudder
feature. To enable or disable the Auto-Rudder feature:

1. On the Combat Flight Simulator startup screen, click Settings.

2. Under Controls, click to select or clear the Enable Auto-Rudder check box,
   and then click OK.
