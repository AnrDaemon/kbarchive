SUMMARY
=======

Windows CE, version 1.0 does not support Windows Internet APIs (WinInet) APIs.
Windows CE, versions 2.0 and 2.1 support WinInet APIs with the following
exceptions:

 - Unlike Win32, authentication is not built into Wininet.dll on Windows CE,
   hence InternetErrorDlg is not supported. Using InternetSetOption for setting
   user name and password is not supported either.

 - Unlike Win32, cookie support is not built into Wininet.dll on Windows CE, and
   therefore such cookie APIs as InternetGetCookie and InternetSetCookie are not
   supported. If a persistent cookie is saved on the Windows CE device while
   using the Pocket IE program, sending a request to the same URL with WinInet
   APIs does not contain the cookie.

 - InternetWriteFile API is not supported.

 - Please note that even when the Unicode version of the WinInet APIs is used,
   text returned by the server (from InternetOpenUrl and InternetReadFile) is
   not converted and is usually ASCII.

 - Wininet.dll (and the corresponding wininet.lib) shipped with retail version
   HPC 2.0 (2.1) does not include FTP APIs. This limitation is by design (to
   save ROM). Therefor it is not possible to use WinInet FTP APIs on the HPC 2.0
   (2.1).

   To clarify: if an HPC version 2.0 (2.1) device contains a retail version of
   the operating system (for example, is purchased in the store), FTP APIs are
   not present. To develop FTP applications on the retail version of Windows CE
   (that does not export FTP APIs from wininet.dll), developers can use Windows
   Sockets.

   NOTE: FTP APIs are included in the emulation library(wininetm.lib) and do work
   in the emulation environment.

 - Known Problem in Windows CE 2.0 (fixed in Windows CE 2.1) applicable to the
   emulation libraries:

   InternetConnect does not correctly submit credentials to the FTP server (bogus
   characters are added to the end of the user name or password). Hence it is
   impossible to establish a connection with the FTP server. This problem is
   addressed in Windows CE 2.1
