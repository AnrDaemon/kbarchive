SYMPTOMS

WORKAROUND

To work around this problem and save a message, perform the following steps:

1. Open the message by placing your cursor over the message and clicking. This
   will open another browser window displaying the message.

2. On the File menu of that browser, click Save As. This will save the file as
   an .asp (Active Server Page) in the location you desire.

MORE INFORMATION

The Outlook Web client does not support the Save functionality mentioned in the
SYPMTOMS section above. It does however, support right-clicking to save file
attachments.
