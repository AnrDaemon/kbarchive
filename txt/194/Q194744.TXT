TITLE   :Netscape Navigator Stops Responding Over SSL Connection
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Posting from Netscape Navigator stops responding over a secure connection when
the Enable Buffering setting in Internet Information Server is enabled.

The Netscape client stops responding if a post request completes and a second
post request is made on the same connection.

CAUSE
=====

An extra CR-LF is sent by the Netscape client at the end of the buffered
request. When using SSL, Internet Information Server attempts to decrypt these
bytes and fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable the Enable Buffering setting under the
properties for the default Web site in the Home Directory\Application
Settings\Configuration dialog.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
