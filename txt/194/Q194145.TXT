TITLE   :MHS: Attachment Not Delivered, But No Error Message Displayed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message that contains an attachment from MHS to Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, the attachment may not be
delivered. The message is delivered successfully and no error messages are
displayed, but the attachment remains in the
MHS\MAIL\GATES\<gateway>\OPARCEL folder on the MHS computer, where
<gateway> is the gateway name.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Attachment field in the message header is located
after a field with a longer field name. For example, the problem occurs if the
Attachment field is located after the Attachment-name field. The buffer used to
hold the field name may not be cleared after the contents of the field are
processed. Therefore, if the next field name is shorter, the field name in the
buffer may be incorrect. This prevents the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS from
delivering the attachment.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
