DOCUMENT:Q194322  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :T/R NIC May Fail Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL) Test
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NDIS 4.0 token ring drivers that support PROMISCUOUS mode fail Windows Hardware
Quality Lab (WHQL) certification tests.

CAUSE
=====

Token Ring drivers that support the ReceivePackets paradigm reveal a problem
with Ndis.sys. When a packet that uses "group addressing" (for example,
broadcast) is received, and promiscuous mode is enabled on the adapter, NDIS
fails to filter the packet causing invalid addresses to be reported to LLC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
