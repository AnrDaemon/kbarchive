The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.01, 4.01 Service Pack 1, 4.01 Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Internet Explorer 4.01 or Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1 Beta
to Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1 on a Windows NT 4.0-based computer that has
Windows NT Service Pack 4 (SP4) and Windows NT Server Option Pack (NTOP) version
4.0 installed, the following error message is displayed:

   Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 Setup - Some services could not be
   started. Setup needs to reboot your system in order to start the
   services.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the installation of Internet Explorer disables the
Protected Storage (Pstore) services and other services that are dependent on
Pstore cannot be restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, restart the computer to re-enable the Pstore services.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
