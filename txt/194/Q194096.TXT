The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 97 and earlier version of this article, see Q183785.

For a Microsoft FrontPage 2000 version of this article, see Q193168.

SUMMARY
=======

When you add a background sound to a Web page in FrontPage Editor, FrontPage
inserts the <bgsound> tag before the </head> tag. Netscape Navigator
ignores the <bgsound> tag. To play a sound in Netscape Navigator, you can
use the <embed> tag.

This article describes how to insert a background sound that plays when you load
an HTML page in a Netscape browser.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To play a background sound in Netscape Navigator, follow these steps:

1. Open your page in FrontPage Editor.

2. On the Insert menu, click FrontPage Component.

3. From the Select A Component list, click Insert HTML and then click OK.

4. In the HTML Markup dialog box, type the following HTML code:

         <embed src="soundfile.wav" hidden="true" align="baseline" border="0"
          width="128" height="128" autostart="true" autoplay="true">

   where soundfile.wav is the name of the background sound file you want to use.
   You can use a .wav, .mid. or .au file. A plug-in may be needed to play midi
   files.

5. Click OK.

6. On the File menu, click Save.

HIDDEN, AUTOSTART, and LOOP Attributes
--------------------------------------

The HIDDEN, AUTOSTART and LOOP attributes of the EMBED tag are described as
follows:

   HIDDEN="true|false"      Setting this attribute specifies whether
                            the plug-in is visible. Some plug-ins
                            (like the LiveAudio plug-in) can control the
                            embedded data type without being visible. The
                            default value is false, meaning that the
                            plug-in control will be displayed.

   AUTOSTART="true|false"   Setting this attribute specifies whether
                            the plug-in will start automatically.
                            Some plug-ins (like the LiveAudio plug-in)
                            can control the embedded data type without
                            user intervention. The default value is
                            false, meaning that the plug-in will not
                            function until the control is clicked.

   LOOP="true|false"        Setting this attribute specifies whether
                            the plug-in plays in a infinite loop. The
                            default value is false, meaning that the
                            plug-in will play once.
