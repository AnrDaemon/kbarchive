TITLE   :XWEB: OWA Client Cannot Access Folders with Affinity
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user accessing the server using the Outlook Web Access component is unable to
read or modify certain public folders. This problem is not encountered when
logged on to a full Exchange client such as Outlook 97 or 98.

CAUSE
=====

The public folder in question has been set to access by affinity. For an OWA
client to access a public folder, a replica of the folder must exist on the
local server. This is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Establish a replica of the public folder on the local (OWA) server.
