======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build an ATL project, you may get the following compiler error:

   c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vc98\atl\include\atlcom.h(3331) :
   error C2660: 'QueryInterface' : function does not take 1 parameters

CAUSE
=====

In Visual C++ 6.0, a templated version of QueryInterface(), which takes one
parameter (instead of the usual two), was added to IUnknown. In ATL 3.0,
CComTypeInfoHolder::GetTI() uses this templated version of QueryInterface(). If
you have an older version of Unknwn.h in your Include path, you get this
compiler error. For example, having the Platform SDK Include directory in front
of the \VC98\Include directory causes this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace the Unknwn.h in the other Include directory with the one from the Visual
C++ 6.0 Include directory.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
