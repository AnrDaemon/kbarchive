TITLE   :FPNW Client Does Not Get Correct Time or Date After Y2K
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an MS-DOS-based NetWare client attaches or logs on to a Windows NT Server
computer running File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW), the client's date
and time are not synchronized with that of the server when the server's date and
time are beyond 12/31/1999 at 11:59:59pm.

CAUSE
=====

FPNW fails to provide the proper date and time information to the client for
synchronization when the server's date is past 12/31/1999 at 11:59:59pm.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


The English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted to the following
Internet locations.

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP3/y2k2-fix/

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell's NETX or VLM NetWare shells running on an MS-DOS-based client
synchronize the client's clock with that of the NetWare server being attached
to. Like Novell's Login.exe, FPNW's Login.exe also synchronizes the client's
clock with that of the server when run.

If one of these MS-DOS-based clients attaches or logs on to an FPNW server
anytime before 12/31/1999 at 11:59:59pm, the client's time and date will be
updated to match that of the server being attached or logged into. If the client
attaches or logs on to an FPNW server after 12/31/1999 at 11:59:59pm, the
client's time will be updated to the correct time, but the client's date will
not be updated.

NOTE: Microsoft Windows NT clients running Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or
Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW), and Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98
clients running the Microsoft Client for NetWare networks do not synchronize the
workstations' clocks when attaching or logging on to NetWare servers.
