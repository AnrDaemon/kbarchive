======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an APPC/CPI-C conversation is deallocated while a TEST_RTS_AND_POST command
is outstanding, the TEST_RTS_AND_POST may complete after the calling application
has deleted the post event, causing an application exception.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Issue the TEST_RTS_AND_POST verb synchronously.

2. End the application by issuing a DEALLOCATE command.

3. In the middle of the application's shutdown, TEST_RTS_AND_POST might set the
   event causing an application exception.

CAUSE
=====

The APPC library included in SNA Server was not designed to cancel an
outstanding TEST_RTS_AND_POST call when an APPC/CPI-C conversation was
deallocated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1. We are researching this problem in SNA
Server version 3.0 and will post more information here in the Knowledge Base as
it becomes available.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
