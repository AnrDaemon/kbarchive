TITLE   :SP4 Periodic Disk Access Interferes with Power Management
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) systems access the hard disk
approximately every five minutes. This access interferes with Power Management.
For example, if your hard disk spins-down after a few minutes of inactivity, the
hard disk will spin-up every five minutes.

CAUSE
=====

The Event Log service in Service Pack 4 maintains a time stamp on the hard disk.
This time stamp is used to approximate system shutdown time whenever Windows NT
is not properly shut down. By default, the time stamp is updated every five
minutes. This feature was intended to operate only on Windows NT Server systems.
Unfortunately, it is also enabled by default on Windows NT Workstation systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
