KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbvfp600 kbXBase KbDBFDBC kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using APPEND PROCEDURE FROM to import a procedure into a database with no
existing stored procedures does not show that procedure in the Stored Procedures
edit window of the database.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Ensure the first stored procedure code added in a database is entered through
   the editor.

2. Open and close/save the procedures editor window before appending the new
   procedure using the following two lines of code:

         KEYBOARD "{ctrl+w}"
         MODIFY PROCEDURES

         ******************Begin Working Code**********************
         #DEFINE CRLF CHR(13) + CHR(10)
         x="PROCEDURE TEST1" + CRLF + "X=1" + CRLF + "ENDPROC" + CRLF
         STRTOFILE(x,"TESTPROC.TXT")
         CREATE DATA TEST
         KEYBOARD "{ctrl+w}" && Added to close Procedure Editor.
         MODIFY PROCEDURES   && Opens the Procedures Editor Window for saving.
         APPEND PROCEDURE FROM TESTPROC.TXT
         LIST PROCEDURES
         MODIFY PROCEDURES
         MODIFY FILE TESTPROC.TXT
         *******************End Working Code************************

MORE INFORMATION
================


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code in a program file:

         #DEFINE CRLF CHR(13) + CHR(10)
         x="PROCEDURE TEST1" + CRLF + "X=1" + CRLF + "ENDPROC" + CRLF
         STRTOFILE(X,"TESTPROC.TXT")
         CREATE DATA TEST
         APPEND PROCEDURE FROM TESTPROC.TXT
         LIST PROCEDURES
         MODIFY PROCEDURES
         MODIFY FILE TESTPROC.TXT

2. Note that the procedure name is listed on the desktop, but there is nothing
   in the Stored Procedures window.

3. Close the Stored Procedures Window, and note that the procedure is displayed
   correctly in the TestProc.TXT window. The stored procedure is actually in the
   database container, and is able to be run, but does not show in the Stored
   Procedures editor.
