SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, when a document containing hidden text is saved in Text Only
format, text formatted as hidden text becomes visible.

CAUSE
=====

When you save a document in Text Only format, all character formatting is lost
from the document. Because hidden text is a character format, it is lost along
with the rest of the character formatting.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, delete the hidden text from the file
before saving the file in Text Only format. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the the Edit menu, click Replace.

2. Place the pointer in the Find What Box.

3. On the Format list under the Find What box, click Character (or Font).

4. Under Style, click to clear the Hidden check box.

5. Leave the Replace With box blank, and click Replace All.
