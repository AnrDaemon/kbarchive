TITLE   :XCON: Empty Subject Msg Can Cause NDR When Sent Through X.400
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When sending a message with an empty subject field through an X.400 connector to
ATLAS, the French X.400 provider, ATLAS generates a non-delivery-report (NDR)
back to the originator with the following message:

   diagnostic = Syntax- error

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server is encoding the empty subject field with:

 - length = 1

 - value = 00

In ITU Recommendation X.420, the subject field is defined as following:

   SubjectField ::= TeletexString (SIZE (0..128))

According to ITU Recommendation T0 to T63, the null character is not a valid T61
character.

==========
