TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Migration Wizard Fails to Migrate cc:Mail User
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Migration wizard will fail, and no mailbox is created on the Exchange Server
computer for the Lotus cc:Mail user if following condition met:

 - The Lotus cc:Mail user has a custom recipient existing in Exchange Server,
   and the cc:Mail user does not have any mail message in the cc:Mail post
   office.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Component: Migration Wizard

   File Name     Version
   ------------------------
   Mlmig32.dll   5.5.2419.0


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This should only be a problem with DB8, which does not create a MAILMESSAGE
section for users without mail. The same problem will occur if the user elects
to not migrate mail. The MAILMESSAGE section is used by the importer to convert
custom recipients to mailboxes. The fix is to create a MAILMESSAGE section for
each user, regardless of whether they have mail, or whether mail is being
migrated.
