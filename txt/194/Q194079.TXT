TITLE   :XCLN: ODK:Some Hex Values Not Accepted for DWORD Registry Entry
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:98
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When assigning a hexadecimal value to a DWORD registry entry using the Outlook
Deployment Kit (ODK), alpha characters are stripped from the entry. For example,
a value of "1E", which represents the decimal number 30, is added to the
registry as "1".

CAUSE
=====

This is currently a limitation of the Outlook Deployment Kit and the way
registry values are entered for DWORD data types.

WORKAROUND
==========

Hexadecimal values must be entered as all numeric values. In the example above,
hexadecimal values of 19 or 20 can be entered, representing the decimal values
of 25 and 32 respectively.
