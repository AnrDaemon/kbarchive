PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the Windows NT Option Pack and Internet Information
Server 4.0 (IIS) on Windows Terminal Server 4.0, the installation does not work
properly.

CAUSE
=====

By default, Windows Terminal Server installs software for the current logged-in
user only. Because IIS is a system service, this type of installation can cause
a variety of errors from setup failures to lost files or documentation.

This behavior is by design.
