SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, after you install
Microsoft Windows, you may receive connection errors. If you do connect to MSN,
you may be unable to view Web sites or receive e-mail messages.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if two Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. Click TCP/IP, and then click Remove.

   NOTE: If more than one network adapter is installed in your computer, the
   TCP/IP protocol is listed with each adapter. For example, if Dial-Up
   Networking is installed, "TCP/IP->Dial-Up Adapter" is listed.

4. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

If you continue to experience connection problems, remove and reinstall TCP/IP.
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. On the Configuration tab, click TCP/IP, and then click Remove. Repeat this
   step for each instance of TCP/IP listed on the Configuration tab, and then
   proceed to step 4.

4. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.
