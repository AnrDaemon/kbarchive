SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) on a laptop computer that
already has Insyde Software Inc. PowerProfiler power management software
installed, your computer may stop responding (hang) and display the following
error message when you restart the computer:

   STOP 0x0000000A: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

Or, this behavior may occur if you install PowerProfiler after you install SP4.

CAUSE
=====

The Advanced Power Management (APM) drivers included with PowerProfiler version
2.30.00 (or earlier) or PowerProfiler/SE version 2.30.01 are incompatible with
the newer power management files that are contained in SP4.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact Insyde Software Inc. Technical Support for an
updated version of the PowerProfiler APM drivers at:
