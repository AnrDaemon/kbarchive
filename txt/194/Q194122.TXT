SUMMARY
=======

After moving an Exchange Server computer out of a site, an administrator may
receive the following error message when trying to view properties on a public
folder in the original site.

   The contents of this public folder are currently unavailable. Either
   the Microsoft Exchange Server Computer servicing this public folder is
   down or the public folder has not been replicated to this site. See your
   administrator.

The public folder may also appear in distribution lists or in Microsoft Outlook,
but is not available. To make the public folder available, create a replica of
the public folder on an Exchange Server computer in the site where you want to
use the public folder. See the Move Server Wizard documentation for alternatives
for handling public folder contents.
