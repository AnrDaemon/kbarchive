KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdisplay

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 on a computer with a proprietary
3Dfx function library file (such as the 3dfxgl.dll file installed during the
installation of id Software's Quake II), you may not be able to access your
video adapter's support for 3Dfx graphics.

CAUSE
=====

The service pack Setup program overwrites the existing Opengl32.dll file in the
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

 - Reinstall the Quake II software and select the Full Install option.

 - Rename the Opengl32.dll file located in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.
   Copy the Quake II 3dfxgl.dll file to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder and
   rename it to Opengl32.dll.

   For information about how to rename a file, click Start, click Help, click the
   Index tab, type "rename" (without quotation marks), and then double-click the
   "Renaming files" topic. For information about how to copy a file, click
   Start, click Help, click the Index tab, type "copy" (without quotation
   marks), and then double-click the "Copying files" topic.

Note that when you use either of these methods, other programs making function
calls to the OpenGL API may not function properly. To provide support for Quake
II and other programs that use OpenGL functions, replace the Opengl32.dll file
in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder with a copy of the same file from Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 3.
