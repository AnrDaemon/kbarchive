Behavior as Loaded/Unloaded, the following error occurs:

   No Visual Basic Project was selected for reverse engineering.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic and open the project you want to reverse
   engineer.

2. If Visual Modeler is not listed as one of the Add-In items under Add-Ins
   menu, bring up Add-In Manager from Add-Ins menu.

3. From the Available Add-Ins list, find Visual Modeler Add-In and Visual
   Modeler Menus Add-In. Place a check next to Loaded/Unloaded as the Load
   Behavior for both.

4. Choose Reverse Engineering Wizard from the Visual Modeler submenu, found on
   the Add-Ins menu.

5. A dialog box, titled Reverse Engineering Wizard, is displayed. Click New to
   have Visual Modeler start with an empty model loaded.

   The following error message occurs:

   No Visual Basic project was selected for reverse engineering.

To work around the problem, do the following before launching Visual Modeler
Reverse Engineering:

1. From the Available Add-Ins list, find Visual Modeler Add-In and Visual
   Modeler Menus Add-In. Place a check next to Load on Startup for the Load
   Behavior.

2. Exit and launch Visual Basic again.
