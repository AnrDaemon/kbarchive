SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Server services, you receive the following
error message:

   Event ID:1234
   Source: MSexchangeDS
   Type: Error
   Category: Internal processing
   Description: The name of this computer [New computername] does not
   match the name recorded in the Microsoft Exchange Server directory
   database [old computername]. If you have renamed this computer, you
   must change the name back to [old computername]. If you have restored
   this database from a backup, it must be restored on the same computer
   that was used for the backup.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three workarounds for this issue:

 - If the computer name was changed, rename it to the original name.

   1. Double-click Network Neighborhood. On the File menu, click Properties,
      click the General tab, and click Change.

   2. Type the old computer name from the description of Event ID 1234 as shown
      above.

 - If you want to restore a backup, reinstall Exchange Server on the old
   computer and use the correct name, and the same organization and site name.

 - Rename the computer to the correct name, as outlined in the first workaround,
   and reinstall Exchange Server.
