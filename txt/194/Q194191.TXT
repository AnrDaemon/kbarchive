TITLE   :XFOR: Notes SMTP Addresses Are Truncated upon Reply
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Lotus Notes client replies to a message received through the Microsoft
Exchange Notes Connector originating from the Internet, the originator's e-mail
address is truncated. A reply to this message will arrive correctly at the
destination, however, recipients listed on the CC line who further Reply All to
this message do not have a valid Notes address to reply to.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is due to the Exchange Notes Connector's convention for
encapsulating one-off addresses (including SMTP) from Exchange Server into Notes
to allow Reply/ReplyAll. It uses the at sign (@) to delimit the RFC822
DisplayName, RFC822 address, and AddressType because that is what Notes uses as
a delimiter. Notes does not handle this convention as expected, and does not
build the reply addresses correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
