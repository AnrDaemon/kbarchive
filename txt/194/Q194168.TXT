delegating subzone:

   Access Violation (0xC0000005), Address: 0x0100bb78 or 0x0100c6c1 on
   DNS.exe.

You may also receive this error:

   Unable to register record <cached record>. Please correct the record
   data and try again.

Following these errors, the DNS server will stop and it will be necessary to
