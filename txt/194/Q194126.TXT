The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 allow you to import newsgroups for a particular news
feed through what is known as an active file, which can be provided by the
Usenet hub, or you can create one using Telnet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. To create an active file using Telnet, first connect to the NNTP Server on
   port 119 using Telnet by clicking Start, then Run, and typing the following
   command:

   telnet <newsvr> 119

2. If the NNTP server requires authentication you will need to authenticate
   yourself using the Authinfo command. See the following example:

   authinfo user <domainname\username> authinfo pass <Password>

3. In Telnet, turn on logging by selecting Start Logging from the Terminal menu
   option. Choose any file name you like. The new NewsFeed Wizard doesn't
   require a specific file name. Then type the following:

   list active

   This will dump the list of all of the newsgroups the server knows about.

4. When you are done, turn off the logging by selecting Stop Logging on the
   Terminal menu.

The newly created file will be an active list for you to use on the server. The
file can also be edited for your needs if necessary.

Additional query words: active list nntp creating
