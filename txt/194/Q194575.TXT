TITLE   :PRB: First Item of List Box or Combo Box Not Selectable
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot click to select the first item in a list box or combo box when its
text is wider than the control and its Itemtip is displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Some possible workarounds are:

1. Do not use Itemtips.

2. Make sure the list box or combo box is as wide as the first item in the list.
   Other items in the list can be longer than the width of the list box or combo
   box.

3. Click on the first item before the Itemtip appears. The problem only occurs
   once the Itemtip is displayed.

4. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to arrow up to the first item.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place the following code into a program file and run it:

         *** Beginning of code ***
         PUBLIC oform1
         USE HOME(2)+"data\customer"
         oform1=NEWOBJECT("form1")
         oform1.Show
         RETURN
         *
         DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form
              Top = 0
              Left = 15
              Height = 289
              Width = 232
              DoCreate = .T.
              Caption = "Form1"
              Name = "Form1"

              ADD OBJECT list1 AS listbox WITH ;
                   RowSourceType = 6, ;
                   RowSource = "customer.company", ;
                   Height = 169, ;
                   Left = 24, ;
                   Top = 24, ;
                   Width = 84, ;
                   ItemTips = .T., ;
                   Name = "List1"

              ADD OBJECT text1 AS textbox WITH ;
                   Height = 25, ;
                   Left = 12, ;
                   Top = 216, ;
                   Width = 192, ;
                   Name = "Text1"

              PROCEDURE list1.Click
                   Thisform.Text1.Value=This.Value
                   Thisform.Text1.Refresh
              ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE
         *** End of code ***

2. When running the form, place the mouse pointer over the first item in the
   list. Once the Itemtip appears, click on it. Note that the text of the item
   does not appear in the text box below.

3. Place the mouse pointer over any other item in the list until the Itemtip
   appears. Click on it. Note that it appears in the text box below.

4. Workarounds 3 and 4 in the Resolution section above can be tried while the
   form is still up. Try clicking on the first item in the list before the
   Itemtip appears; it will show up in the text box. Select the second or third
   item in the list, use the arrow keys to move to the first item. Note that it
   shows up in the text box.
