TITLE   :XADM: Server Missing Public IS after Move Server Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Exchange Server Move Server wizard to join an existing site,
you may be missing the public information store after the move.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run the Exchange Server Move Server wizard on a server that contains
public folders, you get a warning to re-home the public folders before you
continue. If you choose to Ignore and Continue, your public folders are not
moved, and whether you are creating a new site or joining an existing site
determines whether the wizard creates a blank public information store in the
destination site.

Creating a New Site
-------------------

The wizard creates a blank public store in the destination site. The public store
is created the same way that it is created during Microsoft Exchange Server
Setup.

Joining an Existing Site
------------------------

The wizard does not create a public store, and points the private information
store to the server specified on the Select Move Method window.

To view which server you point to as your public information store server:

1. Open the Private Information Store Properties on your server.

2. Select the General tab, and view the "Public folder server" entry.

Creating a Public Information Store on Your Server
--------------------------------------------------

1. On the File menu, click New Other, and then click Information Store.

2. Under "Type of information store", select Public.

3. Select your server, and click OK.

IMPORTANT: After you click OK, carefully read the informational message that
appears and follow the steps it outlines.
