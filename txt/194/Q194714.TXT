TITLE   :Noise Signals Interpreted As Keystroke During Boot Display

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT's boot option display has a feature whereby one can stop the
countdown timer by pressing a key on the keyboard other than the enter key. The
result of this action is that Windows NT will then wait indefinitely until the
user makes the preferred selection and presses the enter key to continue loading
an operating system.

Some keyboards, switch boxes, and BIOSs can mistakenly send random electronic
noise signals that NTLDR interprets as a keystroke and, thereby, determines that
the user has instructed it to not display or process the time-out countdown.

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows NT boots, it displays the boot options available in the boot.ini.

Normal function of this display is to offer options to the user while counting
down a preset number of seconds before loading a default operating system.

Occasionally, the display will not indicate a countdown in progress and will not
load an operating system by default but will wait indefinitely until a user
selects an operating system option and presses the enter key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, upgrade the offending BIOS or attach different
keyboards or switch boxes and test for symptom recurrence.
