TITLE   :FIX: Not All Setup Wizard Options Are Saved in Wzsetup.ini
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbAppSetup kbvfp600 kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard saves all user options in a file named
Wzsetup.ini. The Setup Wizard uses this file to initialize itself on subsequent
runs. However, the options for "Create a Web executable" and "Create a DEP file"
are not saved in the Wzsetup.ini file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because these two options are not persisted, you must select them each time you
run the Setup Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug has been fixed in the updated version of the Setup Wizard Vfp6swiz.exe
dated 10/08/1998. This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.
