TITLE   :X400: Message Not Delivered and Screen Becomes Corrupted

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a message using X.25 from a foreign system to Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, the message
may not be delivered successfully, the screen on the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
X.400 computer may become corrupted, and the X.400 log file may contain entries
similar to the following:

 - 09:40:06 Message file name: 00002523

 - 09:40:09 ERROR 3 (RTS): Association aborted

 - 09:40:09 Outgoing AB SPDU on connection 0: xm[ 5] 19031101 03

 - 09:40:09 Incoming AE SPDU on connection 0: rv[ 5] 29032A01 31

 - 09:40:09 ERROR 1 (RTS): protocol error occurred in state 8

 - 09:40:09 ERROR 3 (RTS): Association aborted

 - 09:40:13 Outgoing AB SPDU on Connection 0: xm[ 12] 190A1101 03C10531 03800104

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when a single transport service data unit (TSDU) contains
a category 0 session protocol data unit (SPDU) and a category 2 SPDU that are
not in the same transport protocol data unit (TPDU), and the second SPDU is the
data SPDU (DT SPDU). Under these conditions, the remainder of the message may be
processed before a TPDU with the EOT flag set is encountered. This may cause the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 to overwrite a portion of the buffer that is
used to combine the SPDUs. Then, when the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
attempts to decode the buffer, it is unable to do so and therefore is unable to
send the message.

==========
