SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set the diagnostics logging levels for the SNADS
Connector through the registry without using the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program.

This article applies to Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 with the WEB 2 release
version of the SNADS Connector or later. This version, or later versions of the
connector, are easily distinguished by the presence of the Diagnostic Logging
tab in the properties of the connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

The diagnostics logging information for the Microsoft Exchange SNADS Connector is
saved in the following location of the Windows NT registry (in the components
key):

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LMS-SNADS

The Diagnostics subkey contains values for each of the logging categories. Each
of these values has data of type REG_DWORD.

The following are the possible data values for each category:

   0   - None
   1   - Minimum Logging
   3   - Medium Logging
   5   - Maximum Logging

Each connector has a subkey named Diagnostics that holds the diagnostics logging
information. Entries 1 through 5 correspond with the above settings on the
Diagnostics Logging Tab in the properties of the connector.
