TITLE   :Extended Log File Format Always in GMT
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) administrators cannot change the time format
for the extended log file format to use a time zone other than Greenwich Mean
Time (GMT).

CAUSE
=====

The extended log file format is defined in the W3C Working Draft WD-
logfile-960323 specification by Phillip M. Hallam-Baker and Brian Behlendorf.
This document defines the Date and Time files to always be in GMT:

   Date
   <date> = 4<digit> "-" 2<digit> "-" 2<digit> Dates are
   recorded in the format YYYY-MM-DD where YYYY, MM and DD stand for the numeric
   year, month and day respectively. All dates are specified in GMT. This format
   is chosen to assist collation using sort.

   Time
   <time> = 2<digit> ":" 2<digit> [":" 2<digit> ["."
   *<digit>]

   Times are recorded in the form HH:MM, HH:MM:SS or HH:MM:SS.S where HH is the
   hour in 24 hour format, MM is minutes, and SS is seconds. All times are
   specified in GMT.

This behavior is by design.
