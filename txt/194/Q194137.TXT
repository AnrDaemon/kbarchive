SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to mail Public Folder URLs within a mail message.

This can be accomplished with the following syntax:

   news:<public folder name as defined through NNTP>

To be able to access these folders via the URL, the clients must have their mail
client(s) configured to use Exchange Server as a news server. For additional
information on how to do this, please consult the Exchange Server
Administrator's Guide and Operations Guide.
