SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) from
the Internet using a Web browser.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install Service Pack 4 from the Internet using a Web browser (such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 or later), visit either of the following Web
sites:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/ntserver/content/servicepacks/

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/downloads/

Click the Install Service Pack 4 link to begin the installation process on the
computer. These Web pages automatically detect which files need to be updated
and then copy the appropriate files to a temporary folder on the computer. Only
those files that are needed to update the computer are installed.

NOTE: If you use a Web browser other than Internet Explorer 3.02 or later, this
update method may not work properly. If you are unable to install the service
pack using this method, download the entire service pack from the Internet to
your computer, and then run the Update.exe installation program locally.

This installation method detects the version of the current service pack on your
computer by querying the registry with ActiveX components. A script, specific to
the version of the service pack detected, copies all appropriate files to be
updated from the Winnt folder to a randomly named folder on the volume with the
most available disk space.

The process then patches each of the appropriate files, running a cyclical
redundancy check (CRC) calculation, to update them to the new SP4 level. If the
CRC does not match what it expects (for example, if the file is a post- service
pack hotfix or third-party-provided file), the script copies the newer file from
a Microsoft Web server.

When all files have been patched, there is a complete image of the service pack
in the temporary folder. The installation program then runs as it would when it
is copied to a hard disk or from a CD-ROM.

NOTE: To obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0,
