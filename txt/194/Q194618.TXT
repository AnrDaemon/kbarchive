TITLE   :INFO: Fast Get Only Works When Compare = Checksum
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe

KEYWORDS:kbSSafe600 kbSSExplorer

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Visual SourceSafe version 6.0 database format has a new Fast Get feature,
but this feature only works when files are compared by Checksum.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, you can set "Compare files by" (go to the
Tools menu, click Options, and click the Local Files tab) to Checksum, Contents,
or Time. If "Compare files By" is set to Checksum, the fast Get uses a mechanism
that speeds up comparing files by checksum. It stores the checksum for every
file in a directory in the VssVer.scc file in that directory and compares it
with the checksum information stored in the Crcs.dat file in the Visual
SourceSafe data directory. If "Compare files By" is set to Contents or Time, the
fast Get does not work.

If you are not using the new database format, comparing by Checksum might not be
the fastest method for comparing files. For more information on comparing files
with the old 5.0 database format, see the following articles in the Knowledge
