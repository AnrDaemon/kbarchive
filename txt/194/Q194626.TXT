TITLE   :Shared Folders Unable to Copy Files With Compression Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Shared Folders is unable to copy files to an AS/400 folder with compression
enabled. In addition, files greater than 6 KB are unable to be copied to the
AS/400.

CAUSE
=====

The compression header is not getting inserted into the compressed Request Unit
(RU) properly if the first element in the RU to be compressed contains no data.

If the Length-checked Compression Indicator (LCCI) bit is set in the Request
Header (RH), the first 3 bytes in the RU makes up the compression header. The
bytes should look like the following:

 - Byte 1 = 0x11 if using RLE compression or 0x21 if using LZ compression

 - Bytes 2 & 3 = length of the uncompressed RU

In the case where there is no data, these bytes are all zeros (000000).

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0 and 4.0
Service Pack 1 for Windows NT. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA
Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compression can be enabled in the following places within SNA Manager for an
AS/400 connection:

 - In the connection properties, under the System Identification tab
