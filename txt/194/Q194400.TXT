SUMMARY
=======

FrontPage Server Administrator is available in two forms:

 - The first form is Fpsrvwin.exe, which is a Windows application.

   -and-

 - The second form is Fpsrvadm.exe, which is a command-line only version of the
   server administrator.

To view the command-line options for Fpsrvadm.exe, point to Programs on the
Windows Start menu, and then click MS-DOS prompt. At the MS-DOS prompt, go to
the \Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\Bin folder, and then type the following:

   " Fpsrvadm -h " (without the quotation marks)

This article describes the command-line arguments available to both forms of the
FrontPage Server Administrator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Fpsrvadm.exe
------------

Fpsrvadm.exe is an MS-DOS and UNIX application, which supports the following
command-line arguments:

Usage: fpsrvadm [-help]
                [-operation <install | upgrade | uninstall | check |
                  security |enable | disable | recalc | putfile |
                  recalcfile>]
                [-port <nnnn>]
                [-web <web name>]
                [-root <frontpage root directory>]
                [-type <ncsa | ncsa-manual-restart
                        | apache | apache-manual-restart
                        | cern | cern-manual-restart
                        | netscape | netscape-manual-restart>]
                [-servconf <server config file>]
                [-multihost <hostname>]
                [-username <username>]
                [-password <password>]
                [-ipaddress <IP address>]
                [-destination <destination Url>]
                [-filename <file name>]

                [-xUser <UNIX username>]
                [-xGroup <UNIX group>]
                [-noChownContent Yes]

You can shorten the command-line arguments by using the first letter of each
command, with the exception of Password, which uses "-pw", xUser, which uses
"-xu", and xGroup, which uses "-xg".

Examples of command-line arguments for Fpsrvadm.exe
---------------------------------------------------

   fpsrvadm -o install -r "c:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage"
            -t frontpage  -u user -pw password
            -s "c:\FrontPage Webs\server\conf\httpd.cnf" -m ""
   fpsrvadm -o install -p 80 -w webname (sub web)
   fpsrvadm -o upgrade -p 80
   fpsrvadm -o uninstall -p 80
   fpsrvadm -o check -p 80
   fpsrvadm -o check -p all
   fpsrvadm -o disable -p 80
   fpsrvadm -o security -p 80 -w webname -u username -pw password
            -i ipaddress
   fpsrvadm -o recalc -p 80 -w webname
   fpsrvadm -o putfile -p 80 -w webname -d url -f filename
   fpsrvadm -o recalcfile -p 80 -w webname -d url

If Fpsrvadm needs additional information, you will be prompted to enter this
information at the MS-DOS prompt.

NOTE: The following server types are not documented in the Fpsrvadm Help file.
The FrontPage Server Administrator retrieves these server types from DLLs
installed on the server system when you install the FrontPage Server
Extensions:

   Microsoft Internet Information Server      msiis
   Microsoft Personal Web Server              msiis
   Microsoft Peer Web Services                msiis
   O'Reilly & Associates WebSite              website
   Netscape Commerce                          netscape-commerce
   Netscape Communications                    netscape-communications
   Netscape FastTrack                         netscape-fasttrack
   Netscape Enterprise                        netscape-enterprise
   FrontPage Personal Web Server              frontpage

Of the supported Web servers on Windows NT or Windows 95 operating systems, the
only servers that require configuration files are Netscape and the FrontPage
Personal Web Server. When you install extensions with Fpsrvadm or Fpsrvwin to
other servers on these operating systems, you may omit the configuration file
option.

Paths that contain spaces must be enclosed within quotation marks (""). For
example, assuming FrontPage is installed in the c:\Microsoft FrontPage folder,
the following command will fail:

   fpsrvadm -r c:\microsoft frontpage

but this command will not fail:

   fpsrvadm -r "c:\microsoft frontpage"

The destination and filename arguments are only used with the putfile and
recalcfile options. These arguments are used when you place content into a
FrontPage Web without using FrontPage Explorer. The filename argument accepts
the name of the file you want to place into the Web. The destination file
accepts the destination URL or the Web for which you want to recalculate links.

The recalcfile option recalculates the Web links going to or from a given file.
You can use this as a substitute for recalculating an entire Web if only one or
a few files have changed. The putfile option places a file into a FrontPage Web
using Fpsrvadm.

The ipaddress argument limits access to the web server based on the IP address.
This feature of FrontPage Server Administrator is not available on Microsoft
Internet Information Servers (IIS).

Fpsrvwin.exe
------------


Fpsrvwin.exe takes only a subset of the arguments available to Fpsrvadm.exe. The
reason is that Fpsrvwin functionality was intended to support the setup program.
Microsoft recommends using Fpsrvadm for batch mode server administrator
operation. Future versions of Fpsrvwin may not support command-line arguments.

Fpsrvwin command-line functionality only supports install, upgrade, and uninstall
because these are the operations necessary from FrontPage setup. The command
line options for Fpsrvwin.exe are:

   -o   -operation <install | upgrade | uninstall>
   -p   -port <nnnn>
   -m   -multihost <hostname>
   -ma   -multihost-all
   -w   -webname <web name>
   -t   -type <frontpage | microsoft | website | netscape |
           netscape-enterprise ...>
   -s   -servconf

If Fpsrvwin needs additional information not provided by its command-line
options, it will prompt you for the information.
