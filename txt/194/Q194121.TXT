KEYWORDS:exc55

SUMMARY
=======

If you have distribution lists (DLs) defined for a site, and the expansion
server for those distribution lists is moved out of the site, you need to
specify a new expansion server for those distribution lists. The distribution
lists continue to work, but the lists cannot be modified until the expansion
server value is updated.

To update the expansion server value:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click Site, then Recipients,
   and select the distribution list.

2. From the File menu, choose Properties.

3. On the General tab, select a new value in the Expansion Server list, and then
   click Apply.
