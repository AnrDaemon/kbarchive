SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the SuperMover Foundation Class that shipped
with Visual FoxPro. The SuperMover class is located in the _movers.vcx class
library.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to set up a SuperMover Foundation Class in an application, here are
some basic properties and methods that you need to understand:

 - aChoices[1,0] array property - This array property contains available choices
   that is in the left list box.

 - aSelections[1,0] array property - This array property contains selected items
   in the right list box.

 - UseArray property - This property specifies whether to use arrays for the
   left list box. When the UseArray property is set to .T., a property array is
   created and the property array can be reference from any object on the form.
   However, when UseArray is set to .F., it basically using the list box's
   AddItem method to add the items to the list box. The default value for this
   property is .T.

 - SortLeft property - This property sorts items in the left list box, the
   default value is .F.

 - InitChoices method - This method initializes the aChoices array and populate
   the initial content of the aChoices array into the list box. The syntax for
   this method is:

         Object.InitChoices(@choicearrayname)

 - choicearrayname specifies the array of initial choices. When the UserArray
   property is set to .F., the choicearrayname array will use as the source for
   the list box Additem method to add the item to the list box and no aChoices
   array will be created.

 - InitSelections method - This method initializes the aSelections array. The
   syntax for this method is:

         Object.InitSelections(@selectionarrayname)

 - Selectionarrayname specifics the array of initial selections.

 - GetSelections method - The method retrieves the selected items. The syntax
   for this method is:

         Object.GetSelections(@targetarrayname)

 - Targetarrayname specifies the name of the array containing the target
   selections.

Example:
--------

1. Create a form, name mymover.scx.

2. Add the SuperMover class, located in _movers.vcx in \Ffc directory, to the
   form.

3. In the Init event of the form, put in the following code:

         DIMENSION aMyChoice[6]
         LOCAL iCount
         FOR iCount = ALEN(aMyChoice) to 1 STEP -1
            aMyChoice[(ALEN(aMyChoice)+1)-iCount] = CHR(64+iCount)

         ENDFOR

         && To initialize the aChoice array property and populate
         && the left list box
         Thisform._supermover1.InitChoices(@aMyChoice)

4. Add two command buttons to the form and change the following properties as
   shown:

         Command1.Caption = "Display selected items"
         Command2.Caption = "Display aChoice array"

5. In the Click event of Command1, place the following code:

         DIMENSION aMySelection[1]
         Thisform._supermover1.GetSelections(@aMySelection)
         LOCAL iCount
         FOR iCount = 1 TO ALEN(aMySelection)
            WAIT WINDOW aMySelection[iCount]
         ENDFOR

6. In the Click event of Command2, place the following code:

         FOR I = 1 to ALEN(Thisform._supermover1.aChoices)
            WAIT WINDOW thisform._supermover1.aChoices[i]
         ENDFOR

7. Save and run the form.

   The left list box displays F,E,D,C,B,A. Click on the right arrow button to
   move a few items to the right list box. Click the "Display selected items"
   button and the selected items will display in the Wait Window. Now, click the
   "Display aChoice array" button, only the items left in the left list box will
   display in the Wait Window.

8. Modify the mymover form again, change the _supermover's SortLeft property to
   .T.

9. Save and run the form again. The left list box now displays A,B,C,D,E,F.
