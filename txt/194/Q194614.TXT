The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you install Microsoft SDKs that were not provided with Microsoft Visual
C++, you might have build problems. The resulting build errors are typically the
result of problems where a symbol is not defined, and therefore a compiler error
such as the following is issued:

   [source filename](line number) : error C2065: 'symbol name' : undeclared
   identifier

A linker error such as the following may also be issued:

   [object filename] : error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol "[undecorated
   symbol name]" (decorated symbol name)

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Microsoft SDKs, compare the header and library dates in the SDK
files with the files that were provided with Visual C++. If the SDK files are
newer, you should place the SDK directories before the default Visual C++
INCLUDE and LIB directories listed in the Directories tab of the Options dialog
box (accessed from the Tools menu).
