The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you right-click a flag in a Facts and Figures article in Encarta Virtual
Globe 99, and then click About Shockwave Flash 3.0, you may be connected
directly to the Macromedia Web site on the Internet.

The Connect To The Web dialog box warning you that Internet content is outside of
the Encarta Virtual Globe product and not under the control of Microsoft is not
displayed on the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The flags in Facts and Figures articles in Encarta Virtual Globe 99 are
Macromedia Shockwave objects.

The About Shockwave Flash 3.0 command on the shortcut menu links you directly to
the Macromedia Web site. This command bypasses the Encarta Virtual Globe warning
message that informs you that you are about to leave Encarta Virtual Globe and
go to the World Wide Web.

If you are already connected to the Internet, no warning message is displayed on
the screen. If you are not connected to the Internet, you may be prompted to
connect by your Internet service provider.
