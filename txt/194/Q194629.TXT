SUMMARY
=======

When you create a new phonebook entry in Dial-Up Networking, you are guided by
the New Phonebook Entry Wizard. However, if you click to select the "I know all
about phonebook entries and would rather edit the properties directly" check
box, you do not see the New Phonebook Entry Wizard again when you create a new
phonebook entry. Instead, you must enter the phonebook entry information
manually.

This article describes how to restore the New Phonebook Entry Wizard so you can
use it when you create new phonebook entries.
