======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

At times, you may want to have a Visual FoxPro application install without user
intervention. You can accomplish this by using the Quiet install mode with the
Setup.exe command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup.exe has several switches that you can use to facilitate different types of
Quiet mode setup options. To install a Visual FoxPro application with Setup.exe
that requires no user intervention, use the /QT switch following the Setup.exe
command. By using this switch, the user has no indication that setup has started
or completed.

You can use the following switches with Setup.exe to install a Visual FoxPro for
Windows generated application:

   

      /Q[0|1|T]     Quiet install mode (0 shows exit, 1 hides exit, T hides
                    all display)
      /QN[1|T]      Quiet install mode with reboot suppressed

Following is a synopsis of what the user will see when you execute Setup with the
appropriate switch:

Setup.exe /Q or /Q0
-------------------

When you execute using either of these switches, Setup opens a dialog box with
"Initializing Setup..." and the user sees the progress bar of the current file
copy status. When the setup completes, another dialog box displays indicating
whether Setup completed successfully. This dialog box requires the user to click
an OK button to close the dialog box and complete setup.

Setup.exe /Q1 or /QN1
---------------------

Using these options displays the dialog box "Initializing Setup..." and then the
progress bar displays. However, the completed dialog box does not display.

Setup.exe /QT
-------------

This setup option does not display any dialog boxes, whether the installation
succeeds or not.

Setup.exe /QNT
--------------

This switch causes the "Initializing Setup..." dialog box to display but no other
dialog boxes display.

You can generate a full list of the options by starting the Setup.exe from the
Run command on the Start menu with the "/" switch (the forward slash character)
as in the following example:

   

      C:\MyVFPApp\SETUP.EXE /
