-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the SNA Client 3270 emulator is configured to use the Greek() code page,
certain font sizes may result in the underscore from underlined characters not
being removed when the screen display is refreshed.

CAUSE
=====

Greek and eastern European code pages which use the "Courier New" font do not
leave room for an underline in certain font sizes. In these circumstances, the
underline appears beneath the actual character cell in the emulator display.

This results in the underline not getting cleared properly when the screen is
refreshed.

To correct this problem, the font size selected is forced to be one line shorter
than needed by the character cell to leave room for the underscore.

RESOLUTION
==========
