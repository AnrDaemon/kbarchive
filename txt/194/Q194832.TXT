PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMiscTools kbvfp600 kbvfp600fix kbXBase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you place a memo field name into the Debugger Watch Window, the value that
displays may contain extra characters appended to the end of the memo field's
actual contents.

This behavior does not occur in Visual FoxPro 6.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

         _CLIPTEXT = 'mymemo'
         CREATE CURSOR CTEMP(MYMEMO M(4))
         APPEND BLANK
         REPLACE MYMEMO WITH 'Junk'
         CLEAR DEBUG
         KEYBOARD '{alt+3}{ctrl+v}{enter}'

2. Look at the value of mymemo in the Watch Window.

   The value for mymemo in the Watch window contains something like the
   following:

         "Junk|", or "JunkW       TTOOLBAR    Debugger                L ST
          "

The extra characters vary depending on what you were doing in Visual FoxPro
before you look at the value in the Watch Window.
