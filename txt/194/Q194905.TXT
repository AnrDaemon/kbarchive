KEYWORDS:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open attachments sent from a cc:Mail version 7 client, the
attachments may appear corrupt. For example, when opening Excel 97 attachments,
the user may receive the following Excel warning:

   ! This file is not in a recognizable format.

Likewise, when you attempt to open Word 97 documents, the files do not appear to
be formatted properly and to the user these files appear corrupt.


CAUSE
=====

The attachments are not being converted properly by Export.exe file version
6.01.00.5 of Lotus cc:Mail.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, upgrade the Lotus cc:Mail Export.exe program used
on the Exchange Server Connector for Lotus cc:Mail (CCMC) to version 8.01 or
later.

MORE INFORMATION
================
