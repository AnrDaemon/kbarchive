SYMPTOMS
========

If you have an Windows NT DHCP server with two network interfaces, one on a
segment with DHCP clients and the other on a segment where you can receive the
same DHCP client packets that have been forwarded by a DHCP Relay Agent, the
DHCP server may hand out addresses to the clients but fail to record them in the
database.

Network Traces will show that the client successfully receives a lease.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
