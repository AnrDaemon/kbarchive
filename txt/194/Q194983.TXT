TITLE   :PRB: Round Function Different in VBA 6 and Excel Spreadsheet
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB kbExcel97 kbVBA600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Round() function in Visual Basic 6.0, a different result may be
returned than when using it in a cell formula of an Excel spreadsheet.

CAUSE
=====

The VBA Round() function uses Banker's rounding while the spreadsheet cell
function uses arithmetic rounding.

RESOLUTION
==========

Write a custom function to get the desired results.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Round() function in an Excel spreadsheet uses Arithmetic rounding, which
always rounds .5 up (away from 0). The Round() function in Visual Basic for
Applications 6, uses Banker's rounding, which rounds .5 either up or down,
whichever will result in an even number.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Excel, open a new spreadsheet and type the following formula into one of
   the cells:

          =Round(2.5, 0)

2. The result is 3.

3. In Visual Basic 6.0 or other applications using VBA 6, open a new project and
   type the following expression into the Debug or Immediate window:

         ? Round(2.5, 0)

4. The result is 2.
