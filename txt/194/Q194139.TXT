KEYWORDS:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========


The Total Transaction Bytes counter for the SNADS to Exchange Service does not
update its count, and remains at zero. In addition, the Non-delivery Reports
From SNADS counter in Performance Monitor (Perfmon) also reads a zero count.

The Total Transaction Bytes counter for SNADS in the Perfmon is a counter meant
to monitor the number of bytes that have been handled by the SNADS to Exchange
Transform Service. It complements the Transaction Count counter which monitors
the number of messages that have been handled by the Service going from SNADS to
Exchange Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
