The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send an attachment with a message using the Outlook Web
Access client, the following error may occur:

   HTTP Proxy Reports: The proxy server has encountered an error (software
   caused connection to abort).

CAUSE
=====

By default, the option "Do not use proxy server for local addresses" is not
selected in Internet Explorer. This causes the browser to use the proxy server
for the local Outlook Web Access server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, when you set up the proxy configuration for
Internet Explorer, select the "Do not use Proxy Server for local addresses"
option on the Connection settings tab.
