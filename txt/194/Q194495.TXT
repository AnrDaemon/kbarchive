The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Word will not convert a password-protected WordPerfect file. When you
try to open a password-protected WordPerfect file in Word, you will receive one
of the following error messages:

 - File cannot be opened because of password protection.

 - Cannot Open File.

 - Converter not installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To convert a password-protected WordPerfect document in Word, you must first
remove the password from the document in WordPerfect, and then resave the
document in WordPerfect without a password.

In WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS and Windows, open the file, press CTRL+F5 (Text
In/Out), press 2 (Password), then press 2 again (Remove). After removing the
password, save the file and quit WordPerfect.

In WordPerfect 5.2 for Windows, click Password on the File menu, click the Remove
button, and then save the file so the change can take effect.

In WordPerfect 6.x for Windows, click Save As on the File menu. Clear the
Password Protect check box, and then resave the document without a password.


MORE INFORMATION
================

WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS and Windows contains an option to lock a document
with a password. To lock a WordPerfect document, select Text In/Out (CTRL+F5),
Password, Add/Change, and enter your password twice.

In WordPerfect 5.2 for Windows, click Password on the File menu, type a password,
click the Set button, retype the password, and click the Set button again.

In WordPerfect 6.x for Windows, click Save As on the File menu. Click to select
the Password Protect check box and save the document. You will be prompted to
enter and verify the password.

Microsoft Word cannot parse the unpublished password encryption employed by
WordPerfect. This WordPerfect feature is by design.
