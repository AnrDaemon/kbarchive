TITLE   :PC MMTA: External Fails when Run as an Idle Process of Dispatch
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Swedish or Italian versions of External 3.5 as an idle process
of Dispatch with the '-tu02' command line option, External fails when started
and logs the following entry in the session log:

   external -BR 0:0:2 terminated with exit code 165,

CAUSE
=====

When you run the Swedish or Italian version of External.exe as an idle process
of Dispatch.exe, and no .ini files are present, External.exe is run using
'external -br00:00:02'. This is invalid, so External.exe fails.

The time separator is correct for all other instances within Dispatch but fails
only when calling External.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
