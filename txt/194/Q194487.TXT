SUMMARY
=======

Two file formats with similar abbreviations (RFT and RTF) are commonly
confused.

The difference between these two formats is as follows:

 - RFT-DCA (commonly referred to as RFT) represents IBM Corporation's
   Revisable-Form Text Document Content Architecture format. This format was
   developed by IBM for transfer of documents between its word- processing
   systems and other systems.

 - RTF represents Microsoft Corporation's Rich Text Format. The Rich Text Format
   standard is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for easy
   transfer between MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2, and Apple Macintosh applications.
