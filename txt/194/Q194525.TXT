   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access a client mailbox using Outlook Web Access (OWA), the
following error message may appear:

   VBScript Runtime Error '800A01A8' Object Required: 'Application (...)'
   \exchange\USA\logon.asp, Line 12

CAUSE
=====

The error in the "Symptoms" section can be caused by incorrect permissions on
required files for the OWA client, registry changes, or damaged files. This
article covers these areas and lists ways to correct the above error.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
When you attempt to resolve this problem, check the following items:

1. Verify that permissions on Cdohtml.dll are correct. Users must have READ
   permissions to this .dll. This file is responsible for doing all the
   rendering of the ASP pages with OWA. To check the permissions:

   a. Right-click on the filename, and click Properties.

   b. Click the Security tab, and then click Permissions. Cdohtml.dll should be
      located in the Exchsrvr\Bin directory. Ensure that all users have at least
      READ permissions to this directory.

2. Check the registry. It is possible you have a problem with a registry key
   value for:

OWA 5.5 and OWA 5.5 SP1:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{BC00F700-31AC-11D0-B5F1-00AA00BF3382}

-and-

OWA 5.5 SP2:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f780-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f781-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f782-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{BC00F700-31AC-11D0-B5F1-00AA00BF3382}

This is the key for Cdohtml.dll. You can export this key, and then run
Regsvr32.exe on the .dll to register the key back correctly into the registry.
The following steps describe how to export and remove the registry value.

   a. Click Start , click Run, type "regedit " (without the quotation marks) to
      start the Registry Editor, and then Click OK.

   b. In the Registry Editor, select the key you want to back up.

   c. From the Registry menu, choose Export Registry File.

   d. In the Save In list, select the folder where you want to save the backup.

   e. In the File Name box, type a name for your backup file, such as"Options"
      or "Backup."

   f. In the Export Range check box, ensure that "Selected branch" is selected.

   g. Click Save. The file is saved with a .reg extension.

   h. Select the key you want to remove:

OWA 5.5 and OWA 5.5 SP1:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{BC00F700-31AC-11D0-B5F1-00AA00BF3382}

-and-

OWA 5.5 SP2:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f780-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f781-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f782-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{BC00F700-31AC-11D0-B5F1-00AA00BF3382}

   i. Press the DELETE key, or click the right mouse button, and then click
      Delete.

   j. Exit Registry Editor.

      After this has been completed, stop the WWW service either through Control
      Panel, Services, or through the Internet Information Service (IIS)
      manager. Reregister Cdohtml.dll by typing the following syntax at a
      command prompt, or by clicking Start, Run, and typing the following
      command in the text box:

   " regsvr32 c:\exchsrvr\bin\cdohtml.dll " (without the quotation marks)

   k. After you re-register the Cdohtml.dll file, it may be necessary to verify
      the permissions on the registry entries. To verify the permissions,
      perform the following steps, in the order in which they appear:

       - Open regedt32.

       - Locate the following registry keys:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f780-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f781-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{bc00f782-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382}
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{BC00F700-31AC-11D0-B5F1-00AA00BF3382}

       - Highlight each key, click Security and then click Permissions.

       - Assign the Everyone group Full Control of the registry keys.

       - Assign the IUSR_<ServerName> account Full Control of the registry
         keys.

   l. Restart the WWW service.

3. An apostrophe in the directory name into which OWA has been installed can
   cause the error message in the "Symptoms" section to appear. If this is the
   case, remove the OWA component and reinstall to a different directory.

4. If you still have problems after following steps one, two, and three earlier,
   it may be necessary to remove and reinstall the OWA component by using
   Exchange Server Setup. The following steps describe removal and
   reinstallation of the OWA component.

   a. Start the Exchange Server Setup program from the Exchange Server CD-ROM.

   b. Select Add/Remove from the Installation screen.

   c. From the next Setup screen, click to clear the checkbox for Outlook Web
      Access. Continue with the Setup program to enable OWA to be removed.

   d. To reinstall the components, start the Exchange Server Setup program
      again.

   e. Select Add/Remove from the Installation screen.

   f. From the next setup screen, click to select the Outlook Web Access check
      box, and continue with the installation.

   NOTE: Occasionally when you try to remove the Outlook Web Access component
   from the Exchange Server Setup Add/Remove selection, the check box for this
   option cannot be cleared. You may not be able to remove only the OWA
   component option by using Add/Remove. Removing the related registry key
   enables the OWA component to be reinstalled. To do so, follow these steps:

   a. Run the Registry Editor (Regedit or Regedt32.exe).

   b. Select the following registry key:

   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup

   c. Remove the string value "Web Connector" from this key. This clears the OWA
      component check box option from the Exchange Server CD-ROM Setup program.

   d. Close the Registry Editor, and reinstall the OWA component using the
      Exchange Server Setup program.
