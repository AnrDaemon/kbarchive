======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build a project created with a Custom AppWizard that was based on
another project, the following link errors might occur:

   

   mfcs42d.lib(dllmodul.obj) : error LNK2005: _DllMain@12 already defined
   in <projname>.obj

   

   mfcs42d.lib(dllmodul.obj) : error LNK2005: __pRawDllMain already defined
   in <projname>.obj

   

   Debug/<projname>.dll : fatal error LNK1169: one or more multiply defined
   symbols found

   

   LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file "mfcapwzd.lib"

CAUSE
=====

The Custom AppWizard project creation wizard does not carry over build
configurations of base projects. Instead, it generates standard Release and
Debug configurations. It ignores any custom settings in the original project,
such as preprocessor defines, additional libraries, custom build steps, and so
on.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the project settings in the CustomizeProject function of your Custom
AppWizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Starting with Visual C++ 6.0, the object model supports adding new
configurations and modifying build settings for single files. Use these methods
to create appropriate configurations during the CustomizeProject phase of your
custom AppWizard. For more information, please see the following topics in the
Visual C++ Documentation:

   Visual C++ Documentation: What's New in Visual C++ 6.0 ?;
   What's New in Visual C++ Version 6.0 ?; Object Model

   Visual C++ Documentation: Using Visual C++; Visual C++ Programmer's
   Guide; Beginning Your Program; Details; AppWizard Programming Reference;
   CCustomAppWiz; CCustomAppWiz::CustomizeProject

In Visual C++ 5.0, you may create custom build steps for an entire project, and
modify project settings for the two standard configurations the Custom AppWizard
generates. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q181503 PRB: Custom AppWizards Can't Make Per-File Settings/Build Steps


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual C++ 6.0, on the File menu, click New, and then click the Projects
   tab.

2. Select Custom AppWizard from the Projects list; give it a name and click OK.
   In this example, the name is Cstm1.

3. Click Finish on the next dialog box, Step 1, then click OK on the
   confirmation dialog box.

4. Press F7 to build Cstm1. It should build without errors.

5. Now, follow steps 1 through 4 again, with the following changes:

   a. Name the Custom AppWizard Cstm2.

   b. In step 3, click Next instead of Finish, browse for Cstm1.dsp as the base
      project, then click Finish.

Continue with the following steps:

6. From the File menu, click New, and then click the Projects tab.

7. Select Cstm2 AppWizard from the Projects list; give it a name and click OK.
   In this example, the name is Cstm2Proj.

8. Click OK on the confirmation dialog box. The Cstm2Proj project loads.

9. Press F7 to build Cstm2Proj.

RESULT: The results are as described in SYMPTOMS. The Cstm2Proj project does not
build a Custom AppWizard identical to Cstm1, as you might expect.
