 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the default value of the "Cancel the call if not connected
within <XX> secs" check box on the Connection tab in the Modem tool in
Control Panel, the Modemlog.txt file still shows the modem's S7 register set to
55 seconds. Regardless of the value you enter, the value is still set to 55
seconds.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum value for this field is 55 seconds. Any number less than that
results in the modem's S7 register being set to 55 seconds. To set the register
to a value greater than 55 seconds, apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to the
computer before changing the default value.
