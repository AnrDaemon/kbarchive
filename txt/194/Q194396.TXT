SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Windows NT Option Pack 4.0 on Windows Terminal Server 4.0
and clients try to use the Internet Explorer 4.0 Web browser, it will appear to
stop responding. The following message is displayed in a dialog box on the
server:

   MDM.EXE - DLL Initialization Failed
   Initialization of the dynamic link library
   c:\wtsrv\system32\kernel32.dll failed. The process is terminating
   abnormally.

In addition, you may see occurrences of event ID 10010 from DCOM in the Event
Viewer with the following description:

   The server {0C0A3666-30C9-11D0-8F20-00805F2CD064} did not register with DCOM
   within the required timeout.

CAUSE
=====

Mdm.exe is the Machine Debug Manager, which is used by the Windows NT Option
Pack and Microsoft Developer Studio to provide application debugging. When
Script Debugging is enabled for Internet Explorer 4.0, the debug manager is
initialized whenever Internet Explorer 4.0 is started. In a Windows Terminal
Server session, however, the debug manager cannot be initialized properly in the
Interactive User's context and returns the errors listed above.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Rename the MDM.exe found in the system root\system32 directory.

-OR-

 - Remove all registry entries related to "MDM" and Machine Debug Manager.

-OR-

 - For each client that will use Internet Explorer 4.0, disable Internet
   Explorer 4.0 Script Debugging by performing the following steps:

   1. Open Control Panel.

   2. Double-click the Internet icon.

   3. Click the Advanced tab.

   4. Click the check box next to "Disable Script Debugging" to enable it.

   5. Click OK.

   6. Close Control Panel.

   -OR-

 - If script debugging is required on a development server, it is possible to
   change the user context that Mdm.exe runs by editing the registry.

   NOTE: The following solution should only be used on a development or test
   server.

   WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious
   problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
   cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry
   Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

   1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

   2. Locate the RunAs value under the following keys in the registry (presented
      here as a list for readability):

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
  \AppID
    \{0C0A3666-30C9-11D0-8F20-00805F2CD064}
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \Software
    \Microsoft
      \Windows NT
        \CurrentVersion
          \Terminal Server
            \Install
              \Software
                \Classes
                  \AppId
                    \{0C0A3666-30C9-11D0-8F20-00805F2CD064}

   3. Double-click the value to change it, and enter "administrator" (without
      the quotation marks).

   4. Click OK.

   5. Quit Registry Editor.

   -OR-

 - Register the Class ID as System Global.
