SUMMARY
=======

When connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server using a DSN, an option or checkbox
(depending on the version of the ODBC Driver) is available to use a Trusted
Connection (or Integrated Security).

This option is not available as a parameter for DSNLESS connections.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To make a DSNLESS connection using a trusted connection to SQL Server, set the
UID and PWD parameters equal to NULL. This will force the ODBC driver to connect
using a trusted connection instead of SQL Server Authentication.

Below is an example of the connection string needed to create a Trusted
Connection:

     Dim Connect As String
     Connect="Driver={SQL Server};Server=TestServer;Database=Pubs;UID=;PWD="
