The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to install a Microsoft
Visual Basic 6.0 application on a Microsoft Windows-based Terminal Server
Client, the following error message may occur:

   Cannot start main setup program!
   (CreateProcess() returned error code 0x00000002H)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition is not a supported
platform for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, an application that is created in
Visual Basic 6.0 may be installed and may work on Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server
Edition. It may be necessary to modify path information before installing a
Visual Basic 6.0 application using the Terminal Server client.

NOTE: Visual Basic 6.0 is supported on Windows 2000 Server with terminal services
installed.

The error above can be avoided by modifying the path environment variable on the
Terminal Server client to contain the exact path of the \Windows and
\Windows\System directories. The following is an example of what the path should
be set to:

   C:\WTSVR\Profiles\[User]\Windows

and:

   C:\WTSVR\Profiles\[User]\System32

where [User] is the username name for the user logged on to the Terminal Server
client. The information would be entered into the path as a single line
separated by a semicolon (;). The following steps demonstrate how to modify the
path environment:

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Open the Windows Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon, and click the Environment tab.

3. In the System Variables list, click Path.

4. In the Value box, add the necessary path information, as shown above, for
   both the \Windows and \Windows\System32 directories for the given user, and
   separate these two entries with a semicolon (;).

5. Click OK to exit the System Properties dialog box. The Visual Basic
   application should now install without the error message listed above.
