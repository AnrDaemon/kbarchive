TITLE   :DNS Fails with Error 1201 If Secondary Zone File Not Specified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a secondary zone is specified in a DNS boot file and does not contain a file
name, DNS will not start and Event 7023 is logged stating that the DNS server
failed to start. Also, an error 1201 is logged in the event log.

CAUSE
=====

Bind implementation of the DNS boot file states that the file name of a
secondary zone can be optional. However, Microsoft's DNS treats this as a
required field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
