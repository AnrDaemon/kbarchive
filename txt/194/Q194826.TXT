TITLE   :HOWTO: Designate a Visual SourceSafe Project as a Web Project
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600 kbSSExplorer kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When creating a Web site from a Visual SourceSafe project, some of the
information that is asked for is not fully explained.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a description of what each box on the Web Project tab expects:

This Project represents a Web Site
----------------------------------

This is the project that is going to be made into a Web project.

URL
---

This is the server location where the Web site will be located. This should
include:

   <LINK TYPE="GENERIC" VALUE="http://"">http://"</LINK>

in front of it. It should be the entire path to the Web site. For example:

   http://MyServer/MyDivision/MyProject

Virtual Root
------------

If the project will be accessed from a different, shorter path, add that path
here. In IIS, these are known as Virtual Directories; other Web Servers may have
something similar that this might work with. You do not add the first "/" for
the directory. For example, "MySite" would make this Web site's location be

   "<LINK TYPE="GENERIC"
   VALUE="http://MyServer/MySite".">http://MyServer/MySite".</LINK>

Site map filename
-----------------

Change the default name of the site map you can create for this site. The default
name is SiteMap.htm.

Deployment path
---------------

This is where the Web site should be sent. It can contain multiple locations, all
separated by commas. They should be ftp addresses or directory paths. Please see
the following examples:

   C:\InetPub\Wwwroot\mysite

   \\Server\Wwwroot\mysite

   ftp://username:password@www.microsoft.com/mysite

  
   \\Server\Wwwroot\mysite, 

   ftp://username:password@Myserver

Set Another
-----------

This commits the changes for this project and then clears the boxes so that you
can set another if you choose. If you click OK, you commit the changes.
