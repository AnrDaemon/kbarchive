SUMMARY
=======

To create and test an ActiveX Control in Visual Basic 5.0, it was necessary to
create two projects: one for the control and one to test it. Similarly, in order
to test a UserDocument in Visual Basic 5.0, you had to run the document in the
IDE, then start the Web browser and point the browser to the location of the
temporary VBD file. This is no longer true in Visual Basic 6.0. Testing a
UserControl or UserDocument inside the Visual Basic 6.0 IDE has become much
simpler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to debug a UserControl within a single project:

1. Create a new ActiveX Control project. UserControl1 is created by default.

2. Start the project. When the dialog containing the Debugging tab is displayed,
   click OK. Your Web browser will start and the control will be activated
   inside the browser.

Steps to debug a UserDocument:

1. Create an ActiveX Document DLL project. UserDocument1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton to the document.

3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of UserDocument1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            MsgBox "See, this really does work!!"
         End Sub

4. Start the project. When the dialog containing the Debugging tab is displayed,
   click OK. Your Web browser will start and the UserDocument will be activated
   inside the browser. Click the CommandButton and the message box will appear.
