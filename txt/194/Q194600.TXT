TITLE   :PC Ext: Some *SPECIAL Mssgs. Cause WinNT & OS/2 MMTAs to Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2,3.5

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The OS/2 multitasking message transfer agent (MMTA) stops responding (hangs)
with SYS 3175 memory allocation errors when the External program processes
*SPECIAL messages.

The Windows NT MMTA hangs with a General Protection Fault on Async.ovl. An OS/2
program caused a protection violation.

At this point, the OS/2 and the Windows NT MMTA stops processing mail, and
continue to produce errors even after re-starting.

The MS-DOS version of the External program does not produce the error.
