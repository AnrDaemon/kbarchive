-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Resource Kit application Timezone.exe was left out of the
resource kit even though the documentation for it was included.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Timezone.exe is a command-line utility that updates the daylight savings
information for a time zone in the registry. The start and end of daylight
savings time in some countries is not static -- it changes from year to year.

This tool works on computers running Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows
95. (The Msvcrt.dll file must be installed in the Winnt35\system32 directory
under Windows NT 3.51 for the utility to function in that operating system.)

The TIMEZONE application may be found at:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/i386/

Download the Timezon1.exe file to your resource kit directory and run it either
by either double-clicking it or from the command line. The executable is
self-extracting and contains two files: timezone.exe and readme.txt.
