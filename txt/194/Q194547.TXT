TITLE   :X400: ISO 6937 Message with Attachment Is Not Delivered
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message with a message body that is encoded as an ISO 6937 body
part through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, and the message contains an
attachment, the message may not be delivered successfully, and the following
entry may appear in the X.400 log file:

   ERROR 3 (AttachP2): ISO6937 conversion failed.

Note that this problem typically occurs after 10 or more messages of this type
are sent through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400. In addition, note that
messages sent through the gateway after this problem occurs may never be
delivered.

CAUSE
=====

When the body of a message is encoded as an ISO 6937 body part, and the message
contains an attachment, the attachment name body part is also encoded using ISO
6937. The Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 does not properly convert the
attachment name body part to ISO 6937, which may limit the amount of free memory
available on the computer. After this problem occurs repeatedly, the lack of
free memory may prevent the gateway from successfully delivering the message.

==========
