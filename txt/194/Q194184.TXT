TITLE   :INFO: General Protection Fault Error Handling in VFP 6.0 and 7.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::6.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMiscTools kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro versions 6.0 and 7.0 offer improved error reporting for General
Protection Faults (GPF) and Fatal Errors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In earlier versions of Visual FoxPro, a General Protection Fault (GPF) or Fatal
Error result in the display of one of two dialog boxes: either a Dr. Watson
dialog box or a dialog box stating that a GPF has occurred.

In Visual FoxPro 6.0 and 7.0, when a GPF or Fatal Error occurs, a dialog box
appears with the program call stack. With the call stack information, you are
able to trace the problem code more easily than in earlier versions.

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before
you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

This enhanced error reporting can be disabled by editing the registry; to do so,
follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, and then enter REGEDIT.

2. Locate the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key, click to select it, and then click New Key
   on the Edit menu.

3. For the new key name, type VisualFoxpro.6.

4. With this new key selected, clicking New Key on the Edit menu to create
   another new key beneath it.

5. Name the new key Exceptions.

6. With the new Exceptions key selected, you will see an entry in the right-hand
   pane of RegEdit that resembles the following:

(Default)                REG_SZ                      (value not set)

7. Double-click the (Default) entry and enter 0 in the Value data box in the
   window that appears.

   A value of 0 in the new key created here will disable the enhanced error
   reporting in VFP 6.0. To do this for VFP 7.0, perform the same steps again,
   but in step 3 name the new key VisualFoxpro.7.

Note that this only affects the development versions of VFP 6.0 and 7.0. The
run-time versions report the errors described in the first paragraph of the
"More Information" section.
