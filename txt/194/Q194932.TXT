======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An implicit incoming Remote logical unit (LU) cannot be reset to "None" with
SNACFG, once it has been set to another value.

To reproduce this behavior, submit the following command in a command-line
shell:

   SNACFG APPCLLU servername:local LU name /IMPREMOTELU:None

This will cause the following error message to appear:

   Error - Implicit Remote LU NONE not found

Leaving the /IMPREMOTELU parameter blank causes the same error message.

CAUSE
=====

Instead of removing the previous associated implicit remote LU, SNACFG tries to
resolve the Name, which of course does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

--------------

3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
