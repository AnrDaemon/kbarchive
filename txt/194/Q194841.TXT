SYMPTOMS
========

After editing the project IDL file by hand, you may receive the following error
when trying to add a method or property to an interface using the ClassView
shortcuts Add Method and Add Property:

   Unable to create the function because the header or the implementation file
   could not be found.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the IDL file before using the ClassView shortcuts Add Method and Add
Property.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

CASE 1:

1. Create a default ATL COM AppWizard project.

2. In ClassView, right-click on the root node and select New Class. Add a new
   ATL Class Interface pair.

3. Open the project's IDL file in the Source editor.

4. Add five blank lines anywhere above the interface you added as part of step
   2.

   NOTE: Do not save anything at this point. The unsaved change is key to causing
   the problem.

5. In ClassView, right-click on the interface created in step 2 and select Add
   Method. Complete the Add Method dialog box and click OK.

   RESULT: The error described in the SYMPTOMS section is displayed. Click OK to
   dismiss the error dialog box and click Cancel to dismiss the Add Method
   dialog box.

6. Manually save the project's IDL file and repeat step 5.

   RESULT: The error does not occur.

CASE 2:

1. In the project's IDL file, add a source file comment above or below any
   method or property in any declared interface.

   NOTE: Do not save anything at this point. The unsaved change is key to causing
   the problem.

2. Repeat steps 5 and 6 from CASE 1.
