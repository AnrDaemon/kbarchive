TITLE   :WD97: IF Fields Not Visible in Mail Merge Documents
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbfield winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Microsoft Word for the Macintosh version 5.1 print merge
document in Word 97, and the document contains IF and ENDIF fields, a blank line
appears in place of the IF fields.

CAUSE
=====

Word97 converts these fields to IF fields, which do not require ENDIF fields.
The conditional fields are still part of the document; however, by default, they
may not be visible.

RESOLUTION
==========

View the conditional IF fields by showing field codes. To turn on display of
field codes, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the View tab.

3. Click to select (put a check in) the Field Codes check box.

4. Click OK.

The conditional statements should now be visible in the document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

================
