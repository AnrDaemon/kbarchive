SUMMARY
=======

When users log on to a Terminal Server and Internet Explorer 4.x is installed,
Internet Explorer 4.x creates personalized settings for each user who logs on to
the same Terminal Server after the logon process occurs.

MORE INFORMATION

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: When you remove this key, make sure that you back it up first. Removal of
this key may stop Microsoft Outlook 2000 from recognizing that Microsoft Outlook
Express is installed.

To prevent the personalized settings from being created, follow these steps:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \Software\Microsoft\Active Setup

3. Delete the Installed Components key and the personalized settings are not
   created.
