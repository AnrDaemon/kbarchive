SYMPTOMS
========

Outlook 98 and Outlook 97
-------------------------

When Outlook is configured for Internet mail, sending mail with this service you
will receive a non-delivery report (NDR) stating, "No transport provider was
available for delivery to this recipient. The service is installed but doesn't
show up in Tools/Check for new mail on..."

CAUSE
=====

Outlook clients need to create an RHC file in the %systemroot%\system32
directory. The complete filename for the RHC file is:

   MSIN****RHC

where **** is going to be a different number for each user.

The default permission on the System32 directory is:

   Everyone Read (RX)

Change this to:

   Everyone Change

and uncheck:

   Replace permissions on Subdirectories and Replace permissions on
   existing files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Changing the permissions on the System32 directory to Everyone Change (RWX)(RWX)
will allow users when running Outlook to create these files.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
