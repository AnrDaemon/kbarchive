======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Unregistering an ATL DLL or .exe file that was built with a version of Visual
C++ prior to 6.0 might result in an access violation when Atl.dll (version
3.00.8168) that ships with Visual C++6.0 is installed on the machine.

Running "REGSVR32.EXE /U" to unregister an ATL DLL might display the following
error message:

   DllUnregisterServer in <component.dll> failed. Return code was:
   0xc0000005

Running an ATL .exe file with the "/Unregserver" switch may display a dialog box
titled "OleMainThreadWndName: <server.exe> - Application Error", with the
following error message:

   The instruction at 0x00000000 referenced memory at 0x00000000. The memory
   could not be read.

The ATL server has to be of build type Release MinSize or Unicode Release
MinSize.

CAUSE
=====

In the version of Atl.dll that comes with Visual C++ 6.0, the _ATL_OBJMAP_ENTRY
structure has an additional member called "pfnGetCategoryMap". During
unregistration, AtlModuleUnregisterServerEx() tries to access this member, which
does not exist for ATL servers built prior to Visual C++ 6.0, and the access
violation occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following options:

 - Rebuild your server with Release MinDependency. This statically links in all
   the code that was in Atl.dll, so your server isn't dependent on it. Even for
   a 'Release MinDependency' atl.dll may need to be shipped.
