SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to extract files from the Nt4sp3_i.exe or
Nt4sp3_a.exe file. The Nt4sp3_i.exe file contains Service Pack 3 for the Intel
platform; the Nt4sp3_a.exe file contains Service Pack 3 for the Alpha platform.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To extract the Service Pack 3 files, download the Nt4sp3_i.exe or Nt4sp3_a.exe
file. You can download Service Pack 3 from the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver

NOTE: If you double-click the Nt4sp3_i.exe or Nt4sp3_a.exe file after you
download it, Setup begins the Service Pack installation. If you want only to
extract the files, do not double-click the Service Pack file after you download
it.

To extract the Service Pack files without starting the installation program:

1. Type "nt4sp3_i /x" or "ntsp3_a /x" (without quotation marks) at a command
   prompt.

2. In the Choose Directory For Extracted Files box, type the full path of the
   folder into which you want to extract the files.

   NOTE: Do not extract the files into the %SystemRoot% or %SystemRoot%\System32
   folder.

3. Click OK, and then click OK.

Note that the extracted files require substantial disk space:

   File           Required space

   Nt4sp3_i.exe   56,441,868 bytes
   Nt4sp4_a.exe   84,701,624 bytes
