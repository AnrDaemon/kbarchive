======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194972.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions from the FrontPage
Server Administrator or by running the Setup program from the FrontPage compact
disc, the following error occurs:

   Unknown HTTP server type msiis

   -OR-

   When you try to install Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions from the
   FrontPage Server Administrator and try to select a server, the only choice
   available is the FrontPage Personal Web Server.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by one of the following:

 - A corrupted or empty Servers.cnf file in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft
   FrontPage\Version3.0\Servsupp directory.

 - A corrupted download of the server extensions.

 - A corrupted [Ports] section in the C:\Winnt\Frontpg.ini directory.

 - Permissions on the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Frontpage\Version3.0\Servsupp
   directory are incorrect.

 - You are not logged on as an administrator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use any or all of the following methods:

Method 1 (Corrupt or empty Servers.cnf file)
--------------------------------------------

In the %Program Files%\Microsoft FrontPage\Version3.0\Servsupp folder locate the
file named Servers.cnf. If this file is empty, ensure that the administrator has
Full Control set on the Servsupp directory and all the files in the directory.
Run the FrontPage Server Administrator, and if the Servers.cnf file is still
empty, remove and reinstall the FrontPage Server Extensions.

Method 2 (Corrupted download of the FrontPage Server Extensions)
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run the FrontPage Server Administrator to remove the extensions.

2. Click the Start button, choose Settings, and then select Control Panel.

3. Double-click Add/Remove Programs and remove the extensions.

4. Ensure that the %Program Files%\Microsoft FrontPage\Version3.0\Servsupp
   directory has been removed by the Uninstall operation. If it has not, delete
   that directory through the Windows file system. If access is denied when you
   attempt to do this, stop the Web server running on the system and delete the
   folder. Restart the Web server when you have successfully deleted the folder.

5. Go to http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/wpp/license.htm and download the new
   FrontPage Server Extensions.

6. Reinstall the new extensions per the Readme.txt file.

Method 3
--------

1. Open your %Windows Dir%\Frontpg.ini file in Notepad. In that file, there is a
   parameter block labeled [Ports]; this is the list of IP/port combinations
   that you currently have extensions installed for. If you see your base IP, or
   if you are not multihoming and you see Port80= and Port 443=, delete those
   lines.

2. Reinstall the new extensions per the Readme.txt file.
