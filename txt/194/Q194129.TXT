TITLE   :Microsoft DNS Fails to Acquire Zone Transfer from BIND Primary
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changes made to a BIND primary DNS zone file are not being seen by a Microsoft
DNS server configured as a secondary.

CAUSE
=====

BIND does not automatically update the serial number in the SOA record. DNS
secondaries determine if a zone transfer (AXFR) is required by querying for the
SOA from the primary zone. If the serial number in the primary's SOA is
identical to the serial number in the secondary, the zone data is assumed not to
have changed and a zone transfer is not requested.

RESOLUTION
==========

With a BIND primary, it will be necessary to manually update the SOA serial
number (sometimes called the magic number) so that automatic zone transfers can
be performed between the BIND server and a Microsoft DNS server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information, see RFC1034 paragraph 4.3.5: Zone Maintenance and
Transfers.
