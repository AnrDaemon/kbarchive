TITLE   :XADM: Unable to Post a Reply to Exchange 5.5 Newsgroup Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5,5.5 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc55 exc55sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some Internet News readers may be unable to post a reply to a newsgroup folder
hosted on an Exchange Server 5.5 computer if the server has been configured to
not allow anonymous access.


CAUSE
=====

When anonymous access has been disabled on an Exchange Server 5.5 computer, the
server responds to a client connection with a 201 banner (no posting allowed).

Here is an example of the banner received by the client:

   201 Microsoft Exchange Internet News Service Version 5.5.1960.6 (no
   posting)

Because posting is allowed (as long as the client authenticates), the banner
returned should be a 200 (posting allowed):

   200 Microsoft Exchange Internet News Service Version 5.5.1960.6 (posting
   allowed)

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
