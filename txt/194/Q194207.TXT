SUMMARY
=======

When using the OLE DB Templates with an Access database, it is often necessary
to add records to a table that contains an autonumber column.

Enabling the autonumber column to increment properly with the Microsoft OLE DB
Provider for Jet 3.51 requires some care. To accomplish the task, two accessors
are required:

 - one, for inserting new records, that contains the autonumber column so it can
   be retrieved and used in the application.

 - one that does not contain the autonumber column.

How to use Multiple Accessors with the OLE DB Templates is documented in the MSDN
in the FAQ for the Consumer Templates inside the Visual C++ documentation.

The following sample code displays how to define multiple accessors:

      BEGIN_ACCESSOR_MAP(CProductsAccessor, 2)   // Pass number of accessors

        BEGIN_ACCESSOR(0, true)         // true = an auto accessor
          COLUMN_ENTRY(2, m_ProductName)
          COLUMN_ENTRY(3, m_UnitPrice)
          COLUMN_ENTRY(4, m_UnitsInStock)
          COLUMN_ENTRY(5, m_UnitsOnOrder)
          COLUMN_ENTRY(6, m_ReorderLevel)
        END_ACCESSOR()
        BEGIN_ACCESSOR(1, false)       // false = not an autoaccessor
          COLUMN_ENTRY(1, m_ProductID)
        END_ACCESSOR()

      END_ACCESSOR_MAP()

Code to add a new record to the table would resemble the following:

      CProducts rs;

      rs.Open();
      rs.ClearRecord();
      strcpy(rs.ProductName,"New product name");
      rs.UnitPrice = 10;
      rs.UnitsInStock = 0;
      rs.UnitsOnOrder = 100;
      rs.ReorderLevel = 25;
      rs.Insert();

This code inserts the new record using the auto accessor; the ProductId column,
which is defined as an autonumber column, will be automatically updated by Jet.
If we had included the autonumber column in the auto accessor, the OLE DB
Provider for Jet 3.51 would have used whatever value we had assigned to
m_ProductID when it updated the column and not used an autoincrement value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To retrieve the values for the autoincrement column in the second accessor, an
explicit call to GetData() is required specifying the accessor containing the
autoincrement column:

      rs.MoveNext(); //Move to next record retrieving values for auto accessor
      rs.GetData(1); //Retrieve values for accessor 1

When changing data via SetData(), the accessor containing the columns you want
updated (that is, not the autoincrement column) should be specified; otherwise,
SetData() will loop though each accessor, including the accessor that contains
the autonumber column.

      rs.UnitsInStock--;  // Decrement units in stock
      rs.SetData(0);      // Update columns in accessor 0

NOTE: Jet 4.0 provider will not have this limitation. To use autoincrement
columns with it, you need to use COLUMN_ENTRY_STATUS(1, m_id, m_id_status) and
set rs.m_id_status = DBSTATUS_S_IGNORE; before calling Insert().
