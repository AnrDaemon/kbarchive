SYMPTOMS
========

The following message may appear in the Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 2510, Source: Server, Type: Error
   Description: The server service was unable to map error code 1909.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the following conditions exist:

 - Account lockout policies are in effect.

 - A user logging on to a computer running either Windows 95 or Windows 98
   attempts to change his or her domain password but is unsuccessful because he
   or she typed the "old password" incorrectly at the Change Password dialog
   screen.

 - The user locks the account by entering a wrong "old password" and clicking OK
   more times than the number of allotted "bad logon attempts" in the Windows NT
   domain's account policy.

If all of these items are satisfied, the 2510 error code will appear in the
System Event Log of the Windows NT domain's primary domain controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enter a correct "old password" when attempting to change passwords from Windows
95 or Windows 98.
