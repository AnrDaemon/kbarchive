The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Outlook client for the Macintosh to open a PowerPoint
attachment created using Microsoft Office 98 for the Macintosh, the file will
not open and you receive the following error message:

   The document <filename> could not be opened, because the application
   program that created it could not be found. Could not find a
   translation extension with appropriate translators.

Also, the icon of the attachment is a generic file icon rather than the normal
PowerPoint presentation icon.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Office 98 for the Macintosh introduced a new file type for PowerPoint
98 that was not previously mapped by the Outlook Macintosh clients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, apply the latest U.S. service pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 1, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
