======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ASTERISK (*) key does not expand the complete class information for a class
selected in ClassView. On its first usage, the ASTERISK (*) key expands to a
single level, much like the PLUS SIGN (+). Subsequently, it expands all levels
with the exception of Globals, or it fails to display Globals and some
interfaces in ActiveX projects.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the PLUS SIGN (+) or click the PLUS box with the mouse pointer first, then
press the ASTERISK (*) key. You must still expand the Globals branch in a
separate step.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.


MORE INFORMATION
================

ClassView supports the cursor keys for navigation from the keyboard. It supports
the PLUS SIGN (+) to expand a branch, and the MINUS SIGN (-) to collapse a
branch. The ASTERISK (*) key has the special meaning "expand all."

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On the Visual C++ File menu, click New and then click the Projects tab.

2. Select MFC ActiveX ControlWizard; name the project Active, and click OK.

3. Click Finish, and then click OK to create the project.

   In the new project, ClassView displays the following:

   + Active classes.

4. Click once on the phrase "Active classes" in ClassView.

5. Press the ASTERISK (*) key. Note that class names appear, but they are not
   expanded to display class information. Also, note that the interface
   _DActiveEvents appears.

6. Press the ASTERISK (*) key again. Note that all classes are fully expanded,
   but the Globals branch remains collapsed.

7. Press the MINUS SIGN (-)to collapse the class information.

8. Press the ASTERISK (*) key again.

RESULT: After step 7, ClassView displays the entire class information tree fully
expanded. However, the interface _DActiveEvents and the Globals branch are
missing.
