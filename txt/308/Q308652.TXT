TITLE   :IDBSchemaRowset::GetSchema Fails to Return List of Rowsets
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an application that is using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 or
Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 calls the GetSchemaRowset command to retrieve a
list of stored procedures from a host system that is running DB2 UDB for OS/390
version 6.1, no stored procedures will be listed. The GetSchemaRowset command
works properly when run against DB2 UDB for OS/390 version 5.1 systems, but not
6.1.

CAUSE
=====

DB2 UDB for OS/390 version 5.1 and earlier defined stored procedures by using
the SYSIBM.SYSPROCEDURES table. In DB2 UDB for OS/390 version 6.1, stored
procedures are defined in the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES and SYSIBM.SYSPARMS tables. The
Microsoft OLEDB Provider for DB2 and Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 are not aware
of this difference and continue to check the SYSIBM.SYSPROCEDURES table when
they access host systems that are running DB2 UDB for OS/390 version 6.1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.
