SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to add alternate text to different hot spots on the
same image map.

A hot spot is an area on a Web-page object that contains a hyperlink. A picture
or other graphic object that contains a hot spot is called an image map.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add alternate text for different hot spots on the same image map, follow
these steps:

1. With the hot spots already created on your image map, click HTML to view the
   source code.

2. Locate the tag that contains the following text

   area href

   for the image map that you want to edit.

3. After the shape tag for each hotspot, type the following:

   alt="<text>"

   For example:

   <area href="page.htm" shape="rect" alt="alternate text" coords="39,53,170,137">

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each hot spot that you have created.

NOTE: The "alt" portion of the area href tag actually designates a ScreenTip, not
alternate text, but the effect is that of alternate text.
