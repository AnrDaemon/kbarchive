PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMiscTools kbvfp kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700 _IK283

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Immersion Desktop 2.1 software that comes with the IFeel Logitech mouse
is running, Visual FoxPro 7.0 may stop responding upon starting or soon
thereafter.

Earlier versions of Visual FoxPro do not have a problem with the Immersion
Desktop 2.1 software.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro 7.0 does not run properly if the Immersion software is already
running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

To work around this problem, turn off the Immersion software.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Logitech IFeel mouse comes with software created by Immersion Software. This
software makes the mouse vibrate when the cursor passes over an object that
performs an action when clicked; for example, a hyperlink or a button object.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install the Immersion software that comes with the Logitech IFeel mouse. You
   can also download this software from the Logitech Web site:

   http://www.logitech.com (http://www.logitech.com)

   Follow the links to the IFeel mouse and select the Download Software link. The
   file name is IMMDESKTOP21_ALL.MSI.

2. After the software is installed, you will see an icon on the Windows Taskbar
   that looks like a hand. (An Immersion Desktop tool tip appears when you move
   the mouse over it.)

3. Click Start, point to Programs, and click Microsoft Visual FoxPro 7.0. Note
   that Visual FoxPro stops responding upon starting or shortly thereafter.
