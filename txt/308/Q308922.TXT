SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft Streets and Trips, Microsoft Internet
Explorer Setup stops responding.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there are too many empty INF files on your hard disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

To resolve this issue, run the Disk Cleanup utility, delete all of the empty
OEM*.inf files, and then reinstall Internet Explorer and Streets and Trips. To
do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
   and then click Disk Cleanup.

2. In the Select Drive dialog box, click C.

3. Click to select the following check boxes:

    - Temporary files

    - Downloaded Program Files

    - Temporary Internet Files

4. When the Cleanup process is complete, restart your computer.

5. Click Start, point to Search, and then click "For Files or Folders".

6. In the Named box, type "OEM*.inf" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click Search Now.

7. When the search process is complete, note the size of each file (located to
   the right of the file name).

8. Press and hold down the SHIFT key, select each file that has a size of 0
   bytes, and then press DELETE.

   When the confirmation message appears, click Yes.

9. Click Start, and then click Run.

10. In the Run box, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

11. On the General tab, click "Selective startup", and then click to clear each
   check box.
