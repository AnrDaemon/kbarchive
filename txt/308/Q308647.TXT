TITLE   :Local TP Entries Not Deleted from TP Table After Process Ends
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Entries for local Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) transaction
programs (TPs) may remain in the internal Host Integration Server 2000 (HIS
2000) TP table even after the TP has completed execution. Ending the process for
the TP also does not remove the entry in the TP table.

CAUSE
=====

A race condition in Host Integration Server 2000 is preventing shared memory
from being updated with a list of TPs that have been terminated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The local TP table contains entries for each local TP that is running in Host
Integration Server 2000. The contents of the local TP table can be viewed by
using the utility SNASHMEM.exe that is included with HIS 2000 as follows.

1. Open a command prompt and set the window with the following screen attributes
   so that the SNASHMEM utility display does not scroll:

   screen window size: Width = "80" (without the quotation marks), Height = "50"
   (without the quotation marks)
   font selection: Font = Raster Fonts, Size = 6x8

2. Click "OK" (without the quotation marks) and then maximize the command prompt
   window.

3. Type "SNASHMEM.EXE" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

4. On the main screen:

    - select T(Display TP Entries) to display all local TP entries.

-or-

    - select Z(Dump TP Entries) to dump the contents of the local TP table to a
      file named "SHOWMEM.txt".

NOTE: Pressing ESC from the main screen will exit the utility.
