   continue, as Internet Explorer 5.0 is not installed.

This problem is not seen on Windows 2000 systems.

CAUSE
=====

During installation, the End-User Client checks the Internet Explorer registry
key for version information. In this case, it only checks for version 5.0; any
other version information causes setup to fail.


WORKAROUND
==========

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Version value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer

3. On the Edit menu, click String, replace the first numeric value with the
   value 5, and then click OK.

   For example, if the version says 6.0.2600.0000, change it to 5.0.2600.0000.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: After installing the End-User Client, this registry value should be changed
back to its original value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.
