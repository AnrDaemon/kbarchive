TITLE   :Can't Use AppGetStatus in a Script to Administer IIS 5.1
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot use the AppGetStatus method in a script to administer Internet
Information Services (IIS) 5.1.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

AppGetStatus is an IIS Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) method call
that you can use to check the current status of a Web site. The IIS method call
AppGetStatus is still available through ADSI, but you cannot use it in scripts.
The AppGetStatus method can still be called from a program that is written in
C++.

The IIS ADSI method call AppGetStatus2 has replaced AppGetStatus and you can run
this from a script. AppGetStatus2 supplies identical functionality as
AppGetStatus.

The following code is a scripting sample using AppGetStatus2:

   <% 
     Dim DirObj, vStatus 
     Set DirObj = GetObject("IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC/1/ROOT/MyAppDir") 
     'Get the status of the application. 
     vReturn = DirObj.AppGetStatus2 
   %>
