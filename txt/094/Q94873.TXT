SUMMARY
=======

When running the Full Page Color display driver for Windows that ships with More
Windows by Aristosoft, you may receive the following error message:

   [Application] has caused a General Protection Fault in module VGACLR.DRV.

Where [Application] is the Windows application that is currently running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Aristosoft Technical Support has confirmed that you may get GP faults in Windows
when using the Full Page Color display driver, VGACLR.DRV, that ships with More
Windows.

More Windows is a Windows application that eliminates the need for scroll bars in
Windows. For example, with More Windows you are able to scroll to Windows or
icons not shown in Program Manager by moving your mouse to the edge of the
Program Manager window.

More Windows ships several different display drivers, but Aristosoft has
confirmed that the problem only occurs with the Full Page Color driver.

As a workaround, you can change your display driver to one of the other More
Windows display drivers, or you can use one of the display drivers that shipped
with Windows. However, using a Windows display driver will not allow More
Windows to work correctly.

For more information, call Aristosoft Technical Support.

More Windows is manufactured by Aristosoft, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
