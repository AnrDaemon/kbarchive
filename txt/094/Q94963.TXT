SUMMARY
=======

File Manager can format a hard disk drive partition only if the hard disk drive
geometry supports 512 bytes per sector. You cannot use File Manager to format
other hard disk drive metrics (such as 1024 bytes per sector).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are unsure what your hard disk drive geometry is, you can find out by
using the Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) utility, which ships with Windows. To do
this, type "msd" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt and then
choose Disk Drives from the Main menu.

NOTE: File Manager does not rely on the MS-DOS FORMAT command to perform its disk
formats. (It does not rely on any MS-DOS command to perform disk functions.)
