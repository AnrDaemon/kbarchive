TITLE   :FIX: ORG Behavior Different with Span-Dependent Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b, if the offset
for an ORG directive depends on the difference between two labels (a
span-dependent value), the assembled code differs from that produces by previous
versions of MASM.

CAUSE
=====

The offset for the ORG directive depends on label values that are not yet
determined in the first assembly pass.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the code to remove span-dependent values in an ORG directive in code
assembled with MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, or 6.0b.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b
for MS-DOS and OS/2. This problem was corrected in MASM version 6.1 for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem usually occurs when a forward reference occurs between the two
labels. The assembler adds padding bytes for the forward reference and
eliminates these bytes during a subsequent assembly pass. When this occurs, the
second label has a larger value during the first assembly pass than it does in
subsequent passes.

The sample code below demonstrates this behavior.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   tst1 SEGMENT para public
   ASSUME cs:tst1
   start:
        jmp SHORT forward
   forward:
        mov ax, 4C00h
        int 21h
   tst1 ENDS

   count = offset forward - offset start

   tst2 SEGMENT para public
        DB 1
        ORG count  ; This assembles as ORG 10 in MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and
                   ; 6.0b. It assembles as ORG 2 in MASM versions 5.1 and 6.1.
   xxx  DB 1
   tst2 ENDS

   END start
