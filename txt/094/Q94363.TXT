-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may occur during startup if the SMC_ARC.DOS driver
is being used:

   SMC Arcnet Mac Driver 10/01/91 Version 2.05 PS110,PS210 Board in a PS/2
   System

   \dev\smc_arc Error:POR failure or Adapter not found

This error indicates that the system board is being detected as a PS/2 board even
though it is an ISA or EISA board.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, edit the MAC driver section (example: [MS$SMC270])of
the Windows for Workgroups PROTOCOL.INI file adding the following line:

   Micro_Channel=0

Here is an example of how the section reads:

   [MS$SMC270]
   DriverName=SMC_ARC$
   interrupt=2
   iobase=0x2E0
   memorybase=0xD000
   MICRO_CHANNEL=0

WARNING: When editing the PROTOCOL.INI file manually, always remember that
modifications made with the Network settings in Control Panel may result in the
loss of any manual editing. Therefore, it may be necessary to add this entry
again after modifying settings through Control Panel.
