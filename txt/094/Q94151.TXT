SUMMARY
=======

When you use the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M
(HPPCL5E.DRV) version 1.03 or 1.04 and Adobe Type Manager (ATM) versions earlier
than 2.5, text formatted for ATM fonts may not be aligned correctly. The text
may not print in the font for which it was formatted and gray bands may also
appear behind the text.

This problem has been reported to Hewlett-Packard for all version of ATM earlier
than 2.5. Upgrading to ATM 2.5 seems to correct the problem.
