PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when attempting to run either MS-DOS
Prompt or an MS-DOS-based application in Windows 386 enhanced mode while the
Norton Desktop for Windows screen saver Sleeper is activated:

   Cannot write to device aux

This error can occur with either NDW.EXE or PROGMAN.EXE as the shell.

CAUSE
=====

According to Symantec, this problem is caused by a problem in Sleeper.

This problem can also be caused by a bad sound driver in the [drivers] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file. If the driver identified in the "Aux=<filename>" line
is bad or not in the path, this message may be displayed when Windows 3.1 is
booted.

WORKAROUND
==========

A patch is available on Symantec's BBS that corrects the problem with the
Sleeper screen saver. This patch (COMPAT.EXE) allows Sleeper to work with
Windows in 386 enhanced mode. For additional information, contact Symantec
Technical Support.

If the problem is caused by a bad sound driver, use Windows Control Panel to
remove the driver from the installed drivers section.
