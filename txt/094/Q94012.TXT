SUMMARY
=======

The Multimedia Device Control (MCI.VBX) TimeFormat property does not support all
format settings with all device types. When you assign a value to TimeFormat
that is not supported by the device, the TimeFormat retains its previous
setting.

This article also describes MCI_FORMAT_MSF (2) and shows how to separate the four
bytes of a time value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if the current device supports a particular TimeFormat setting,
assign the value to TimeFormat. Then check TimeFormat to see if it returns the
value assigned. For example:

      For i = 0 To 10
         MMControl1.TimeFormat = i
         If MMControl1.TimeFormat = i Then
            MsgBox Format$(i) + " supported"
         Else
            MsgBox Format$(i) + " not supported"
         End If
      Next

Some of the time formats, such as MCI_FORMAT_TMSF, provide four separate byte
size numbers packed into one four byte long integer. The following sample
statements show how you can extract the four bytes into separate variables:

      byte1 =  MMControl1.Position And       &HFF&
      byte2 = (MMControl1.Position And     &HFF00&) \     &H100
      byte3 = (MMControl1.Position And   &HFF0000)  \   &H10000
      byte4 = (MMControl1.Position And &H7F000000)  \ &H1000000
      If (MMControl1.Position And &H80000000) <> 0 Then
         ' put sign bit back into byte4
         byte4 = byte4 + &H80
      End If

The least significant byte is stored in byte1 and the most significant byte is
stored in byte4.

The following list shows all possible settings for TimeFormat:

   0 MCI_FORMAT_MILLISECONDS
   1 MCI_FORMAT_HMS
   2 MCI_FORMAT_MSF
   3 MCI_FORMAT_FRAMES
   4 MCI_FORMAT_SMPTE_24
   5 MCI_FORMAT_SMPTE_25
   6 MCI_FORMAT_SMPTE_30
   7 MCI_FORMAT_SMPTE_30DROP
   8 MCI_FORMAT_BYTES
   9 MCI_FORMAT_SAMPLES
   10 MCI_FORMAT_TMSF

The TimeFormat setting MCI_FORMAT_MSF is described in the README.TXT file but is
missing from the "Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Features Custom Control
Reference" for version 2.0. The following description of MCI_FORMAT_MSF appears
in the README.TXT file:

   2 MCI_FORMAT_MSF Minutes, seconds, and frames are packed into a
   four-byte integer. From least significant byte to
   most significant byte, the individual data values
   follow:

   Minutes (least significant byte)
   Seconds
   Frames
   Unused (most significant byte)

The TimeFormat property affects the following properties.

   Position
   From
   To
   Start
   Length
   TrackLength
   TrackPosition

Microsoft has confirmed that this information should be included in the
"Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Features Custom Control Reference" for
version 2.0. We will post new information here when the documentation has been
updated with this additional information.
