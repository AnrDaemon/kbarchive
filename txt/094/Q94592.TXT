-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Microsoft Windows
with third-party products or configurations that have not been tested and
are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

Novell NetWare Lite version 1.1 is a peer-to-peer network operating system for 2
to 25 users. This means that any node on the network has the potential to be
used both as client and as a server for all other machines attached to the
network.

NetWare Lite is not a supported network for Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and
3.1, and there is no option available for this network when installing Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article contains information about using NetWare Lite with Windows. Follow
the suggestions outlined below to operate your Windows environment. For further
information on integrating Windows 3.1 and NetWare Lite, contact Novell.

Network vs. Local Installation of Windows
-----------------------------------------

It is recommended that you install Windows locally. If you want to install to a
network directory, contact Novell to receive documentation on this process.

Follow the regular installation procedures using Windows disks. Windows Setup may
indicate the presence of a "Microsoft Network (or 100% compatible)" network.
Change this selection to "No Network Installed."

Before Entering Windows
-----------------------

It is suggested that you run STARTNET.BAT before entering Windows. You also
should map drives and capture ports before entering Windows.

Mapping Drives
--------------

If a server to which you have mapped a drive goes down, Windows displays a
message indicating that the drive does not contain any files. Any attempt to
access that drive fails. With MS-DOS, this error is trapped and the client saves
enough information to automatically restore the connection to that network
directory when the downed server returns to the network. Windows prevents MS-DOS
from trapping this error. To restore connection to your mapped drive, exit
Windows, and reissue the Net Map command when the server is back on the
network.

Network Printing
----------------

Use the Net Capture command described in your NetWare Lite documentation to
redirect printing from your LPT1 or LPT2 ports to a network printer before you
enter Windows. Configure your printer in Windows to either the LPT1.OS2 or
LPT2.OS2 ports, depending on which port you captured before entering Windows.
Workstations that are configured as both server and client should use LPT1.OS2
or LPT2.OS2 to print from Windows.

You also need to disable Fast Printing Direct To Port in the Printer Connect
dialog box. Having this setting enabled bypasses any MS-DOS calls and therefore
is not able to print to any network printers

To disable the Fast Printing Direct To Port option:

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Printers icon.

2. In the Printers dialog box, choose the Connect button.

3. Clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box.

Local Printing
--------------

Once a printer is assigned as a network printer, you should only access that
printer through the network. You may have a printer attached to your workstation
that has been defined as a Network Printer. In this case, you should capture a
port when you want to print to it. If you print to it directly (not using
capture), you may cause print job corruption.

Changes to the SYSTEM.INI
-------------------------

For Windows 3.1, make sure that the following lines are in the [386Enh] section
if the SYSTEM.INI file.

      [386Enh]
      UniqueDOSPSP=ON
      PSPIncrement=5
      TimerCriticalSection=10000
      ReflectDOSInt2A=ON
      OverlappedIO=OFF

If you do not have these options included in the SYSTEM.INI file, you may not be
able to get into Windows once NetWare Lite is loaded.

NetWare Lite Messages
---------------------

Messages sent to network users through NetWare Lite only appear when you are at
the command prompt or when you exit Windows.

More information on the use of Windows and NetWare Lite can be found in Novell's
README.TXT file that is included with NetWare Lite. In addition, Novell has set
up an automated fax system to provide information about using NetWare Lite. This
service can be accessed by calling (800) 638-9273 and then pressing the ASTERISK
key (*) on your touch-tone telephone.
