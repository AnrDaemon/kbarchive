TITLE   :Using Etherlink II TP Network Card with Synoptics Hubs
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When using Synoptics Hubs with 10-Base-T network cards such as the Etherlink II
TP, the switch settings on the card need to be modified from their factory
default settings to enable the card to work properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Synoptics Hubs such as LattisNet models 3030 and 3305, the 2500 family of
Workgroup Concentrators (models 2500, 2510, and 2530) date back to the pre-
10-Base-T standard days. However, they are found in many Ethernet installations
and thus need to be integrated into a 10-Base-T LAN.

If you are using one of these hubs with an Etherlink II TP card, modify the
following jumpers from their factory defaults to the setting indicated:

                   Jumper    Factory      Synoptics
Jumper            area      setting      setting
---------------------------------------------------

DC SIG           J4         OFF          ON

LINK BEAT        J1         ON           OFF

RX TH            J2         NORM         LOW

XMIT             J3         NORM         LOW

This will enable the TP card to transmit successfully using the Synoptics Hubs.
