-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, or Windows SYSTEM.INI file is marked as
read-only, MemMaker displays the following error message:

   MemMaker cannot continue because it cannot gain access to the AUTOEXEC.BAT,
   CONFIG.SYS, or Windows SYSTEM.INI file. Make sure the read-only attribute for
   those files is not set.

   To undo MemMaker's changes, press ENTER.

If your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or SYSTEM.INI file is marked read-only but the
CONFIG.SYS file is not, MemMaker does not undo the changes it made to the
CONFIG.SYS file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the read-only attribute on the AUTOEXEC.BAT
and/or SYSTEM.INI file and restart MemMaker. To remove the read-only attribute
on the AUTOEXEC.BAT and/or SYSTEM.INI files, use the ATTRIB command as follows:

   attrib c:\autoexec.bat -r

   -and/or-

   attrib c:\windows\system.ini -r
