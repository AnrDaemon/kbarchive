SUMMARY
=======

When you are using the MediaVision 16-bit Pro-Audio sound card, Golf may appear
to stop responding (hang) when short sounds are being played.

The problem only occurs when sounds are enabled, and when drivers dated 11/06/92
or earlier are being used for the card.

The version 1.46 of the MediaVision drivers, corrects the problem. You can find
the latest drivers in the following places:

   MediaVision BBS: (510) 770-0968 (WIN144.ZIP)
   MediaVision technical support: (510) 770-9905

This problem does not occur using the 8-bit drivers provided with the card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Further experimentation using the Microsoft Windows Media Player, narrows the
problem down to five waveform files: CHIP.WAV, PINHIT.WAV, PUTT.WAV,
SHORSWG.WAV, and SPLASH.WAV. When playing these files with the Media Player, the
files never stop, and remain playing indefinitely. This is what causes Golf to
appear to hang.
