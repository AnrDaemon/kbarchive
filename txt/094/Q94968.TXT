TITLE   :3COM: Gateway Won't Run -- Validate GATEWAY.INI Entries
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Gateway to 3Com 3+Mail, version 1.00,
sometimes does not run after a successful installation, or the gateway stops
working even though nothing seems to have changed since the last time it was
run.

CAUSE
=====

You may have an invalid installation configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

Validate the installation configuration by validating the contents and location
of the GATEWAY.INI file. The GATEWAY.INI file must reside in the same directory
as the GATEWAY.EXE file (the executable file).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample GATEWAY.INI File
-----------------------

[3+Mail_PCMail]

   MSMailDrive = M:\MAILDAT\
   FFAPIPath = M:\3GATEWAY\
   3ComGateDomain = MSMAIL:CORP
   3ComDefaultDomain = HQ:CORP
   MSNotifyUser = MAIN/P01/ADMIN
   3ComNotifyUser = ADMIN:HQ:CORP
   GatewayPath = M:\3GATEWAY\
   AuditFile = M:\3GATEWAY\LOGS\AUDIT.LOG
   ErrorFile = M:\3\GATEWAY\ERROR.LOG
   BadMessageFile = M:\3GATEWAY\LOGS\BADMSG.LOG
   MFFSendFile = MMFF.PUT
   MFFRetrvFile = MMFF.GET
   ImmFireKey = F10
   ShutdownKey = F3
   Max3ComMsgSize = 20232
   MaxPCMailMsgSize = 4000000
   DefaultShutdownInt = 0
   FireInterval = 240
   Pass3ComAtch = YES
   Break3ComMsg = YES
   BreakPCMailMsg = YES
   3ComProperty = 5001

Here is a list of items to check:

 - The path statements for MSMailDrive, FFAPIPath, and GatewayPath must all end
   with a backslash (\). Other path statements must end with a filename.

 - The directory listed for MSMailDrive must be the current MS-DOS directory. In
   other words, for the example above, if you type DIR M:, the directory listing
   should list the subdirectories for the logical root of the Microsoft Mail
   database (ATT, GLB, NME, MAI, P1, and so on).

 - The location listed in FFAPIPath must contain the two spawned executables,
   COURGET.EXE and COURPUT.EXE.

 - All the directories listed must have Read/Write/Create/Delete permissions for
   temporary files used by the gateway.

 - The property number listed for the XNS name service must be correct. You can
   use the 3Com 3N utility and issue a 3N DIR PROP 5001 (or whatever is listed)
   command to validate the entries for that property.

 - 3ComGateDomain must not be the same as 3ComDefaultDomain.

 - The PC running GATEWAY.EXE must be logged in to the XNS name service as the
   _GATEWAY user in the 3ComGateDomain.

Additional query words: 1.00 gateway 3Com INI install
