SUMMARY
=======

3Com 3Servers have a 3Com 3SCSI Plus card with an external port that can be used
to connect 3Com external SCSI disk drives. To get the server to recognize the
drive, do the following steps:

1. Make a console connection to the 3Server (see Chapter 2 in the "Installation
   and Configuration Guide for 3Servers" manual).

2. Run 3fdisk from the 3Server Utility Diskette (the same one you used to make
   the console connection).

3. From the 3fdisk Main menu, choose option 2, Configuration Menu.

4. From the Configuration Menu, choose option b, "Add drive".

5. Enter SCSI ID for the expansion drive (this is probably 3).

6. Enter the SCSI LUN number (probably 0).

7. Choose the controller type (probably Adaptec ACB 4525).

Note: Make sure that the SCSI disks are terminated properly.
