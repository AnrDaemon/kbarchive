======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you use the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M
(HPPCL5E.DRV) version 1.03 or 1.04 and Adobe Type Manager (ATM) version 2.5,
text formatted for Adobe Type Manager fonts may not print at the correct size if
the Adobe Type Manager check box option Resident Or Pre- Built Fonts is selected
and several mixed sizes of the same font are formatted on the same page.

This problem can be corrected by selecting the Print Fonts As Graphics check box
in Adobe Type Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adobe Type Manager does not assign new font ID values based on point size as
well as font name. Thus, when the driver sends the characters needed to print
the output, only new characters are sent if the font name has changed for those
characters. Changing the point size does not trigger the driver to send Adobe
Type Manager characters for this new point size. When the printer places the
characters on the page, it chooses the characters based on the Font IDs. For
example, if character "A" is sent in Times Roman at 10 point and there is
another Times Roman character "A" at a different size, both will print at 10
point.
