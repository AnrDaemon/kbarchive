-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the MS-DOS MemMaker utility on a system with a Periscope board, the
following error message may be displayed:

   SIZER: UMB's overran list buffer.

CAUSE
=====

MemMaker detects the first 24 kilobytes (K) of protected memory used by the
Periscope board, but does not detect the last 8K. Therefore, when MemMaker adds
the x= parameter, it does not exclude a large enough range.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the x= switch to the device= line for EMM386 to
exclude the C800-CFFF range. For example:

   device=c:\dos\emm386.exe x=c800-cfff

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20
