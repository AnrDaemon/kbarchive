SUMMARY
=======

While troubleshooting problems with Microsoft Windows, you may need to disable
Carbon Copy for Windows. The following information explains how to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Carbon Copy for Windows is a remote communications program that replaces several
key Windows drivers, and modifies the SYSTEM.INI file during its installation.

It may be necessary to disable the Carbon Copy drivers while troubleshooting some
problems in Windows.

The following changes are made to the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file by
Carbon Copy for Windows:

      keyboard.drv=cckbd.drv
      mouse.drv=ccmouse.drv
      sound.drv=ccsound.drv
      display.drv=ccvga.drv
      comm.drv=cccom.drv

The following changes must be made to the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
to disable Carbon Copy for Windows:

      keyboard.drv=keyboard.drv
      mouse.drv=mouse.drv
      sound.drv=mmsound.drv
      display.drv=vga.drv
      comm.drv=comm.drv

Make sure that these files exist in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

These changes to the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file assume Windows has
been set up to run with a 101- or 102-key keyboard, Microsoft Mouse, and
standard VGA display. If a different hardware configuration is in use:

1. Run Windows Setup from the MS-DOS command prompt by exiting Windows and
   typing "setup" (without the quotation marks).

2. Reinstall the correct drivers.

To obtain further information on running Carbon Copy for Windows, contact
Microcom technical support.
