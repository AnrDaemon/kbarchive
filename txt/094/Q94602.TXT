SYMPTOMS
========

The sample application, WMFDCODE, supplied in the Windows 3.1 Software
Development Kit (SDK) can only read metafiles that are less than 64K in size.

To work around this 64K limitation, add one line and modify two lines. In the
file, WMFMETA.C, in the function RenderPlaceableMeta, add this line:

      long      lBytesRead;  // Number of bytes read.

Change the _lread function to _hread to allow the function to use HUGE pointers
to read the file. Also, change the return value to lBytesRead so that it can
accept a long value:

      /* read metafile bits */ 
      lBytesRead = _hread(fh, lpMem, (LONG)(mfHeader.mtSize * 2));

Next, change the if statement that compares the value returned from:

      if ( lBytesRead with -1 ) {

to the following line, which uses long values:

      /* if there was an error */ 
      if ( lBytesRead == -1L )  {

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
