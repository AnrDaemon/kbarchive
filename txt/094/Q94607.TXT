SYMPTOMS
========

The MULTIPAD sample that ships with the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 SDK allows
only one print job to be sent to the printer. Any further attempts to print
result in the following error:

   Cannot print <document name>!

The document is not printed, and you must re-start MULTIPAD to do any printing.

CAUSE
=====

The PRINTDLG data structure used for printing is a global variable, and two
members of this structure are invalid after the first print job is sent. These
members are not properly initialized for subsequent print jobs.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the MPPRINT.C file, in the GetPrinterDC() routine, the following lines:

      if (pd.hDevNames)

      GlobalFree(pd.hDevNames);

      if (pd.hDevMode)

      GlobalFree(pd.hDevMode);

should be changed to:

      if (pd.hDevNames)
      {

       GlobalFree(pd.hDevNames);
       pd.hDevNames=NULL;

      }
      if (pd.hDevMode)
      {

       GlobalFree(pd.hDevMode);
       pd.hDevMode=NULL;

      }

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
