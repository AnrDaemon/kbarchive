SUMMARY
=======

When using the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M
(HPPCL5E.DRV) versions 1.03 and 1.04, and Micrografx Designer 3.1, line ends
will always print rounded and line joins are always mitered regardless of how
they show on the screen if the graphics mode is set to HP-GL/2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is corrected in the Micrografx Designer 3.1 December maintenance
release. Also, the problem does not occur if the graphics mode is set to
Raster.
