SUMMARY
=======

If you want to only change the 32-Bit Disk Access entry in the 386 Enhanced
section of the Control Panel, it may be necessary to reset the settings for the
swap file size and type.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When editing the virtual memory settings to change the 32-Bit Disk Access entry,
the virtual memory settings may also change.

If you want to retain the previous settings, you must enter the virtual memory
settings as well as change the setting for the 32-Bit Disk Access entry. Once
all settings are changed, choose OK. Accept the changes and restart Windows when
the selection appears.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent the virtual memory settings from changing, you may also change the
32-Bit Disk Access setting from outside of the Control Panel.

To do this:

1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file and add the following line to the [386ENH] section:

   32BitDiskAccess= (ON or OFF)

2. Restart Windows.
