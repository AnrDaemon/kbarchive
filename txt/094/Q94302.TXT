======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If InDOSPolling=Yes is present in the SYSTEM.INI file and an Intel EtherExpress
16 network interface card (NIC) is being used in the machine, Windows for
Workgroups may stop responding (hang) for several minutes or may lock up when
trying to access network drives from any program.


CAUSE
=====

InDOSPolling prevents Windows for Workgroups from running other applications
when memory-resident software has the InDOS flag set.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only workaround for this problem is to remove the line from the [386Enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to delete
the line.
