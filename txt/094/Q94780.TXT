TITLE   :ISAMCVT Problems Converting BTRIEVE Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.0; :7.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic for MS-DOS 1.0 
 - Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) for MS-DOS, version 7.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ISAMCVT may have problems converting BTRIEVE data files to the Basic ISAM
format. Some specific instances are:

 - Converting files with multiple string fields greater than 255 characters
   loses the data after the first 256-byte column.

 - Using ISAMCVT to convert a BTRIEVE file requires the use of a SPECFILE which
   is simply a description of the columns and their length. An incorrect
   SPECFILE can lead to memory corruption and cause errors.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
