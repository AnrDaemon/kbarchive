======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When MemMaker reports values in the Change column for conventional memory and
upper memory, the values may not be the same. For example, MemMaker may report
you have 58K more conventional memory and 62K less memory in the upper memory
area (UMA).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under ideal conditions, these two numbers are the same. If one of the following
conditions exist, the values for the change in conventional and upper memory
don't match:

 - A program that loads itself into the UMA changes size (for example,
   SMARTDRV.EXE)

 - The expanded memory manager (EMM) that MemMaker loads (EMM386.EXE) utilizes
   the UMA differently from the current EMM

 - A program that MemMaker configured to load into the UMA did not because of an
   unanticipated problem.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.0 not memory maker 6.20
