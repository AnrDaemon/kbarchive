The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some third-party command shells (such as NDOS or 4DOS) do not require the /P
switch (which specifies the command shell is permanent). As a result, if you use
a third-party shell without the /P switch, and set environment variables from
your CONFIG.SYS file or use MS-DOS 6 or later startup menus, your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file is not processed when you start your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Third-party command shells that do not require the /P switch check to see if an
environment has been created. If it has, they do not call the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
If you use the MS-DOS 6 startup menu feature or you set environment variables
(such as PATH or PROMPT) in your CONFIG.SYS file, an environment is created and
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is not processed.
