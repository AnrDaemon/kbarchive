The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Library Manager Utility for MS-DOS, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 698 of the Microsoft C/C++ "Environment and Tools" manual for version
7.0 includes the following statement to document the Microsoft Library
Manager Utility (LIB):

   The following example instructs LIB to combine the object file FIRST.OBJ and
   SECOND.OBJ and to name the combined library THIRD.LIB:

   LIB FIRST +SECOND, , THIRD

 
This statement, which is incorrect, also appears on page 582 of the
Environment and Tools manual of the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)
version 6.1.

The command line in the example attempts to open the FIRST.LIB library. If
FIRST.LIB exists, LIB adds the object modules in SECOND.OBJ to it and
stores the result as THIRD.LIB. If FIRST.LIB does not exist, LIB creates
FIRST.LIB with the object modules in SECOND.OBJ and ignores THIRD.

The correct command to build a THIRD.LIB library as described in the
documentation is as follows:

   LIB THIRD +FIRST +SECOND;

Additional query words: 3.20 6.10 7.00 7.00a
