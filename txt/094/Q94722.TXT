SUMMARY
=======

When you run MemMaker to optimize a startup (boot) floppy disk, it incorrectly
prompts you to "Remove all floppy disks from your floppy-disk drives and then
press Enter." Although MemMaker specifically supports the optimization of a
startup floppy disk, it displays a generic prompt that assumes you are
optimizing drive C.

To work around this problem, ignore the message to remove all floppy disks, and
press ENTER to restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To optimize a startup floppy disk, you must run MemMaker from drive A. If you do
not, MemMaker optimizes the startup files on your hard disk drive.

To start MemMaker from drive A:

1. Change to drive A.

2. Start MemMaker. (To do this, type "memmaker" (without the quotation marks)
   and then press ENTER.

Note: When you run MemMaker to optimize a startup floppy disk, you must have the
following five files on the floppy disk in drive A.

   CHKSTATE.SYS
   EMM386.EXE
   HIMEM.SYS
   MEMMAKER.EXE
   SIZER.EXE
