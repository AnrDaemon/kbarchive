SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine the number of data groups in a .FRX
report file without using a user-defined function (UDF).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once the .FRX report file layout is complete and the data groups have been
added, the following steps can be used to obtain a report expression that
returns the number of data groups in the .FRX report file:

1. Choose Variable from the Report menu and create a random variable. For
   example, call the variable "GRPCOUNT".

2. For VALUE TO STORE, enter GRPCOUNT+1 . Leave INITIAL VALUE as 0. Set RESET to
   the field name used as DATA GROUP EXPRESSION, instead of END OF REPORT or END
   OF PAGE.

3. Create the report expression IIF(GRPCOUNT=1,1,0) and place it in the page
   footer. Check the CALCULATE option to display the CALCULATE dialog box. Set
   RESET to END OF REPORT and select the SUM option.

4. Place the newly created report expression in either the Group Footer or the
   Page Footer sections.
