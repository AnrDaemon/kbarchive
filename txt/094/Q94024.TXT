SUMMARY
=======

When you run MemMaker on an IBM PS/2, you should run it in the Custom
installation mode and exclude the following device driver:

   DASDDRVR.SYS

MORE INFORMATION
================

DASDDRVR.SYS is an IBM system patch recommended by IBM for all PS/2s
manufactured prior to June 1991. DASDDRVR.SYS stays resident only if it detects
that your PS/2 needs the patch. If this is the case, it should install before
other drivers that may make calls to the ROM BIOS (such as HIMEM.SYS and
EMM386.EXE). DASDDRVR.SYS cannot be loaded high (especially if you are running
Windows).

To work around this problem:

1. Run MemMaker in Custom mode and exclude DASDDRVR.SYS.

   For more information on running MemMaker in Custom mode, see Chapter 6,
   "Making More Memory Available," in the "MS-DOS 6 User's Guide."

2. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file with a text editor and make the DASDDRVR.SYS line
   the first line in the file.
