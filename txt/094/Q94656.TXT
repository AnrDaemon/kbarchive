SUMMARY
=======

When running Windows for Workgroups (WFWG), Workgroup Connections, or Workgroup
Add-On for MS-DOS the MS-DOS version 5.0 MEM/C command or other memory viewing
utility may report MS-DOS to be using excessive amounts (75K or more) of
conventional memory if the NET START command has not yet been executed.

Microsoft recommends that the NET START command be issued before any other
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs are loaded. Loading TSRs before the
NET START command may prevent the protocol manager, PROTMAN.DOS, from returning
its memory to the system pool, or may cause other unpredictable system behavior.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows for Workgroups protocol manager, PROTMAN.DOS, allocates memory
containing data that is a parsed version of PROTOCOL.INI. Other drivers (for
network cards and protocols) need to use the data during the initialization
process, so PROTMAN.DOS holds the data until the binding (NET START) is
complete. Once the binding has occurred, the memory allocated by PROTMAN.DOS is
freed.
