-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run DBLSPACE /RATIO before the NET command is used in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file, you may receive an insufficient memory error message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the network has not released the memory used during
loading because network binding has not yet occurred.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is not necessary to run DBLSPACE /RATIO from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file since
DoubleSpace reliably reports the amount of free disk space. However, if you want
to run DBLSPACE /RATIO from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, place the NET START command
before the DBLSPACE /RATIO command, as in the following example:

   c:\windows\net start
   c:\dos\dblspace /ratio

Additional query words: 6.00 6.20
