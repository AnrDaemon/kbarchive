TITLE   :Unable to Share Printer when SUBST Is Used for TEMP Directory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears if a Windows for Workgroups server is
attempting to share a printer in Print Manager and the TEMP directory is set to
a drive that was created using the MS-DOS SUBST command:

   The specified drive letter or device is invalid. If you specified a drive, it
   may be past the value specified by the LASTDRIVE command in the CONFIG.SYS
   file.

CAUSE
=====

The SUBST command allows specifying a drive letter for a PATH, which enables
easier access to programs and data files. In Windows for Workgroups, these
virtual drives cannot be shared, and because the TEMP directory is used during
printing, TEMP also cannot be shared.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, assign the TEMP variable to a valid (not virtual)
directory. For example, if Windows is installed on the local drive C in the
WINDOWS directory, add the following line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP (or any other valid directory)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Add the following lines to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

         SUBST X: C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
         SET TEMP=X:

2. Add the following command to the CONFIG.SYS file if it is not already
   present:

   LASTDRIVE=Z

3. Restart the computer and then start Windows for Workgroups.

4. From the Main Group, run Print Manager.

5. Select the printer to be shared.

6. From the Printer menu, choose Share Printer As.

7. Choose the OK button.

8. The above error message appears.
