TITLE   :WFWG: Schedule+ May Not Print Entire Appointment Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print with version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ or Windows for Workgroups
Schedule+, the text in the appointment fields may be truncated. There is no
method to customize the printout so that all information is displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only way to work around this limitation is to export the data to a text file
and then import it to another application, such as Notepad or another word
processor, to be printed.

Schedule+ prints approximately 29 characters of the appointment field when
printing the Pocket size page, 96 characters when printing the Junior size, and
116 characters when printing the Standard size. Schedule+ indicates that there
is more information by adding ellipsis (...) to the end of the line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a limitation of Windows for Workgroups
Schedule+ included with versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 plus schedplus 1.0
