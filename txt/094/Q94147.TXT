SUMMARY
=======

When you use the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M
(HPPCL5E.DRV) and the TrueType Screen Fonts Installed check box located in the
driver's setup dialog box is selected, the driver will not enumerate the
internal Intellifont fonts for an application's font list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This option is provided in the driver so that if equivalent TrueType fonts are
installed, the fonts do not show up twice in the font list. If the equivalent
TrueType fonts are not installed and the TrueType Screen Fonts check box is
selected, no Intellifont fonts will be displayed in the font list.

The HP product included here is manufactured by HP, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
