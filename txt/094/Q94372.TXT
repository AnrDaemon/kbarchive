SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Golf for Windows issues the error statement "Machine is too slow to
play sounds" in the Current Sound Driver portion of the System Info dialog box
if the machine fails Golf's internal timing test. Golf performs this test as
Golf is launched, so you may not always receive this message every time Golf is
started.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This test is a series of instructions designed to benchmark the speed of the
particular system. Among the instructions in the series are instructions
representative of those necessary to play the sounds. Through testing, we have
determined that any machine that is unable to perform this series of
instructions less than 3200 times per second is also unable to play the sounds
effectively. We found that machines that were unable to satisfy the 3200 loops
per second requirement produced broken and garbled sound.

Machines such as the 386DX, 486SX, and 486DX should have no problem playing the
sounds. The dominant factors in this benchmark are the CPU speed, speed of
memory chips, and the time spent servicing the resident interrupts, following
the CLI (clear interrupt) instruction.

Anything that reduces the amount of time spent accessing memory, servicing
interrupts, or time in other applications will increase the likelihood of
playing sounds. Other than obtaining a new computer or a sound card, things you
can try to resolve the problem include the following:

1. If the computer has a Turbo switch, make sure that it is on.

2. Eliminate all unnecessary terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs.

3. Run Windows in standard mode.
