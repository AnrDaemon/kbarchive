-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

MemMaker always modifies the CONFIG.SYS file so that the entries are in the
following order:

   DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
   DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE <settings>
   buffers=<setting>
   files=<setting>
   dos=umb
   lastdrive=<setting>
   FCBS=<setting>
   [Everything else in the same order it was already in]

The <setting> and <settings> are determined by MemMaker for each you
specific installation and configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MemMaker does not have a feature that allows drivers load before any of those
listed above. If there is a problem with a specific driver that needs to be
loaded before the above lines, that driver may not function until you manually
edit the CONFIG.SYS file and move the driver to where it belongs.

To work around this problem:

1. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and comment out (REM) the device driver you are
   having problems with.

2. Run MemMaker.

3. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and remove "REM" from the device driver.

4. Return the device driver to its previous location.

NOTE: If the memory configuration that MemMaker created changes when you follow
this procedure, you must manually optimize your configuration.
