   "Call VxD Functions and VMM Services Easily Using Our Generic VxD" by Andrew
   Schulman, page 17.

   Many useful functions can be accessed only from a VxD, but it's a royal pain
   to write your own. Our generic VxD is not a skeleton that you customize; it's
   a complete facility that allows you to call VxD functions and VMM services on
   behalf of your application.
