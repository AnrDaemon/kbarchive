MORE INFORMATION
================

Voice Pilot comes with 17 vocabulary files to help you access application menus
faster and without the use of your mouse in many cases. Each vocabulary file has
a limit of 4000 words. After you have exceeded this limit, the application you
are using may behave erratically and Windows may perform slowly. Some of the
larger vocabulary files included with Voice Pilot have close to 1000 words. The
following is a list of some of the larger predefined vocabularies included with
Voice Pilot and the applications to which they apply:
