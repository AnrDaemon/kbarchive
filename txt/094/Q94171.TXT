======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Lotus Notes with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and running Novell
NetWare connectivity, Notes may stop responding (hang) when trying to access the
network.

CAUSE
=====

By default, Lotus Notes uses LAN0 (Microsoft LANA0) to communicate over a LAN.
When using Novell NetWare connectivity, MSIPX must always use LAN0 (Microsoft
LANA0). Setting Lotus Notes to use LAN1 eliminates this conflict.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, set Notes to LAN1, as outlined below.

1. Start Lotus Notes, but do not try to access anything.

2. From the Options menu, choose Network Ports.

3. Select LAN0 and disable it by clearing the Enable check box.

4. Select LAN1 and select the Enable box.

5. Exit and restart Lotus Notes.

NOTE: This procedure works only if Lotus Notes is running on a Windows for
Workgroups or a LAN Manager server using the NETBEUI protocol.

For information about configuring Lotus Notes to run on Novell servers, query on
the following in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
