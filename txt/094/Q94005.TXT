The Microsoft Windows Notepad application does not save margin settings.
There is no workaround for this behavior; this is a limitation of Notepad.

The Microsoft Windows Notepad has an option for margin settings; however,
the changes made affect the current open file only. When you exit Notepad,
the margins return to their default values. Saving the file does not save
the margin settings.
