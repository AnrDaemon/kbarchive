SYMPTOMS
========

If your CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, or SYSTEM.INI file has 512 or more lines,
MemMaker displays the following error message:

   MemMaker cannot continue because the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, or Windows
   SYSTEM.INI file is too long. The file must be less than 512 lines long

   * To undo MemMaker's changes, press ENTER.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, exit MemMaker, reduce the size of the file that is
causing the error, and restart MemMaker.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use MS-DOS Editor to determine the length of a text file. For example:

1. Start MS-DOS Editor and load a text file such as AUTOEXEC.BAT. For example,
   type the following and press ENTER:

   " EDIT \AUTOEXEC.BAT " (without the quotation marks)

2. Press CTRL+END.

   The number of lines in the text file is displayed in the lower-right corner of
   the screen.
