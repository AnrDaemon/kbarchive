TITLE   :Zenith MasterSport SL/SLE BIOS Update Required
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows for Workgroups with a Xircom Pocket Ethernet I adapter on a
Zenith Mastersport SL/SLE using MFM-300 Monitor BIOS versions earlier than 4.1c,
you may receive the following error:

   Pocket Ethernet Adapter missing, not powered or malfunctioned.
   Press any key to continue...

CAUSE
=====

According to Xircom technical support, you may encounter problems initializing
the Pocket Ethernet I on Zenith Mastersport SL and SLE computers with Windows
for Workgroups if the BIOS version is earlier than 4.1c and NDIS driver version
1.27 (PENDIS.DOS) is being used.

Other drivers (such as Artisoft's Lantastic AI drivers) initialize the adapter
without error using this BIOS revision, but the NDIS driver version 1.27 fails
to recognize the card.

RESOLUTION
==========

To obtain an update to version 4.1c of the Zenith MFM-300 Monitor BIOS, contact
Zenith technical support. This BIOS update may also be downloaded from the
Zenith forum on CompuServe.
