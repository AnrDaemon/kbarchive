SYMPTOMS
========

ASPI2DOS.SYS is an Adaptec driver for the Adaptec AHA 1520 and AHA 1522 SCSI
controllers. If SMARTDrive is used to cache a drive when ASPI2DOS.SYS is
installed, you may receive the following error message from the Adaptec
controller:

   A serious disk error has occurred while writing to drive C.

When you run Microsoft Anti-Virus (MSAV.EXE), you receive the following error
message:

   Not ready reading (or writing) drive C:

Similar errors may also occur while running Microsoft Defragmenter (DEFRAG.EXE)
and Microsoft Undelete (UNDELETE.EXE).

NOTE: The SMARTDrive double-buffer driver does not prevent these errors.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you use the ASPI2DOS drivers shipped with EZSCSI versions
2.02 and 2.03.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem was corrected in EZSCSI versions 2.04, 3.0, and later. These are
available for free from Adaptec.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem usually occurs during frequent alternating reads and writes by
programs such as Microsoft Anti-Virus and SMARTDrive.
