The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Mail and Schedule+ programs packaged with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) have
the option to play a sound when mail is received or when you have scheduled a
reminder. The chime is the system default sound. It is not possible to change
the chime without changing the system default sound unless the appropriate entry
is added to the WIN.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To customize the sound, proceed as follows:

1. Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to open the WIN.INI file.

2. To customize the Mail chime, add the following entry to the [Sounds] section
   of the WIN.INI file:

   MailBeep=<wavefilename>,MailBeep

   where <wavefilename> is the name of the wave (.WAV) file you wish to
   play.

3. To customize the Schedule+ Reminders sounds, add the following entry to the
   [Sounds] section of the WIN.INI file:

   SchdplusReminder=<wavefilename>,SchedulePlusReminders

   where <wavefilename> is the name of the wave (.WAV) file you wish to
   play.

4. Save your changes, then restart Windows for the changes to take effect.

You can replace the wave file name with any playable wave (.WAV) file either by
using the Control Panel Sound option or by editing the WIN.INI file. To play
wave files that aren't in the Windows directory, add a valid path to the file.

The Mail chime is active by default. To change this setting:

1. Run Mail.

2. From the Mail menu, choose Options and clear the Sound Chime check box.

NOTE: The computer must be configured with either a sound card or the PC speaker
driver to use this feature.
