SUMMARY
=======

When you use the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M
(HPPCL5E.DRV), if the TrueType Screen Fonts Installed check box located in the
driver's setup dialog box is NOT selected, but the Intellifont equivalent
TrueType fonts for the printer are installed into Windows, the font list in an
application will appear to have two copies of the same font listed.

To display only one copy of each font, use Control Panel to access the Setup
dialog box of the HPPCL5E driver and select the TrueType Screen Fonts Installed
check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Enumeration of TrueType fonts is handled by Windows rather than the driver. If
equivalent TrueType fonts for the internal Intellifont fonts of the printer are
installed, Windows enumerates these fonts regardless of whether the driver
enumerates the internal Intellifont fonts. Selecting the TrueType Screen Fonts
Installed check box causes the driver not to enumerate the internal Intellifont
fonts.
