SUMMARY
=======

To ensure the integrity of your files that have been copied from your CD-ROM
drive to your hard drive, it is possible to use the MS-DOS File Compare program
(FC.EXE) to compare the files. This test can be used to determine if the CD-ROM
subsystem is functioning properly at the device driver or hardware level(s). It
is a useful method for testing problems related to general protection (GP)
faults or other critical errors that may occur while running a CD-ROM
application with Windows such as read errors or out of memory messages.

To ensure the most accurate test, use the /B (binary) switch. For example:

   fc /b [drive1:][path1]filename1 [drive2:][path]filename2

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the files are corrupt, check the following:

 - Minimize the configuration by simplifying the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
   files then reinstall.

 - Make sure Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX.EXE) version 2.2 or later is
   being used. Check the file date of the CD-ROM device driver. Check with your
   CD-ROM drive manufacturer to see if the manufacturer has an updated device
   driver (the *.SYS file that loads in the CONFIG.SYS file).

 - If you are using Windows 95 in MS-DOS mode, make sure that Mscdex.exe is
   dated newer than 7/11/95

 - In Windows 95, if possible, use a protect-mode CD-ROM driver instead of
   Mscdex. For more information, search your online help for How to Set Up
   Hardware.

 - Try using the Xcopy (binary) command to copy the files from the source
   location to the destination location then use the FC command to compare the
   files. To use the Xcopy command, type the following at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and press ENTER

      xcopy [source] [destination]

   where [source] is the path of the file you want to copy and [destination] is
   the path to where you want to copy the file.
