The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

You can use MemMaker with multiple configurations, but doing so requires that
you create separate configuration files to run MemMaker. The "MS-DOS User's
Guide" for version 6.0 and 6.2 explains this procedure in detail in Chapter 6
(pages 151 to 154).

This article explains why these separate configuration files are necessary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MemMaker removes all references to memory managers, the FILES= statement, the
BUFFERS= statement, and the DOS= statement. It then adds the following
statements at the top of the CONFIG.SYS file:

         DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
      DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE <settings>
      buffers=<setting>
      files=<setting>
      dos=umb
      lastdrive=<setting>
      FCBS=<setting>
      [Everything else remains in the same order]

NOTE: The <setting> and <settings> are determined by MemMaker for
your specific installation and configuration.

Because of this design, MemMaker cannot work with configuration files containing
Multi-Config sections that reference multiple memory managers or have different
memory configurations.

MemMaker also uses a program called SIZER.EXE to determine memory requirements
for device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs. MemMaker
analyzes the contents of the entire CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
(regardless of Multi-Config headings) to calculate the optimum memory
configuration for your system. Because the files are viewed as a single unit,
each individual configuration will not be optimized after you run MemMaker.
