KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install FastBack Plus for Windows, version 1.0, using Windows for
Workgroups, the following warning message appears:

   SYSTEM.INI Includes Non-Standard Drivers!

   Some other application (possibly a backup product from a different
   manufacturer) has modified your SYSTEM.INI file to use incompatible,
   non-standard VDMAD and/or VFD drivers. These drivers may cause failures in
   many applications, including FastBack Plus Windows.

   Install will first backup your SYSTEM.INI as SYSTEM.FBP, and then restore it
   to use the Microsoft standard drivers. This change is necessary for correct
   operation.

FastBack Plus Windows continues installation and changes the virtual DMA device
entry in the SYSTEM.INI file to device=*VDMAD.

CAUSE
=====

The warning message is the result of a change in the name of the virtual DMA
device driver in Windows for Workgroups. Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1 specify
this device in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file as follows:

        device=*VDMAD

With Windows for Workgroups, this entry is changed to:

        device=VDMAD.386

WORKAROUND
==========

To allow Windows for Workgroups to function properly, you need to restore the
default Windows for Workgroups entry. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) and
change the virtual DMA device entry in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file to:

        device=VDMAD.386

STATUS
======

Fifth Generation Systems has confirmed that FastBack Plus Windows operates
properly with the default Windows for Workgroups setting for the virtual DMA
device driver. Future versions of FastBack Plus Windows should recognize this
change with Windows for Workgroups.

FastBack Plus Windows is manufactured by Fifth Generation Systems, Inc., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
