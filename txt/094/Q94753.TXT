The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0

SUMMARY
=======

WinLogin does not recognize a space in a user's login name when using the
"/U:USERNAME" command switch to start WinLogin. Some networks support a user
name that contains a space (example: Banyan Vines). If the user name contains a
space, you cannot use the /U:USERNAME" command switch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "/U:USERNAME" option specifies a name of the user logging on, and if the
name matches that of the last user logged on, the user's backup files are used
to start Windows. This decreases the time needed to start Windows because
WinLogin does not have to build the configuration files; instead, it uses the
backup .INI files stored in the Windows directory.

On a Banyan Vines network, it's possible to have a space in a user's login name.
It is also possible, when setting up the WinLogin database file, to also add a
space for the user name. When WinLogin is started, it looks at who is logged in
and loads that user's files. However, if the /U:USERNAME switch is used with a
name that contains a space (example JOHN <SPACE.> SMITH) it will not work
properly.

In the example above, WinLogin will try to find the user "JOHN"; it will not find
"JOHN" and will prompt you with the following choices before entering Windows:

 - Use the last user's settings

   -or-

 - Use the default user's settings

   -or-

 - Exit
