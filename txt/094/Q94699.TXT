TITLE   :WinLogin Err Msg: Out of Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11; :1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Configuration Manager of WinLogin, you can add files to the listings of
Users, Groups, Workstations, and Administrators. When you add files to this
"file list," a file named WLMERGE.INI is created and/or updated with this
information. If this file reaches 971 bytes in size, the Configuration Manager
closes and displays the error message:

   Out of Memory

CAUSE
=====

When the WLMERGE.INI file exceeds 971 bytes in size, no error message occurs and
no files are displayed in the file list of the Configuration Manager. No matter
what the size of the WLMERGE.INI file, WinLogin continues to work normally. This
limitation of the Configuration Manager does not affect the performance of
WinLogin.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in WinLogin version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
