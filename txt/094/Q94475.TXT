SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to play back Audio-Video Interleaved (.AVI) files from the
Microsoft Video for Windows CD-ROM, the error message

   Can't Read From Drive <CD ROM Drive>

may appear (where <CD ROM Drive> represents the drive letter assigned to
the CD-ROM drive).

This message may appear if the wrong version of the MSCDEX CD-ROM extender is in
use. MSCDEX (usually supplied by the CD-ROM manufacturer) is the file that
allows MS-DOS to access the CD-ROM drive. If the incorrect version of this file
is being used, data transferred from the CD-ROM may be corrupted. If you are
receiving the above error message (or one of a similar nature), try to play the
sample file WINDSURF.AVI (installed during the setup of Video for Windows) from
the hard drive. If this file plays back correctly, contact your CD-ROM drive
manufacturer for help in installing the correct MSCDEX version.

NOTE: In most cases, you will not be able to successfully copy the .AVI file from
the CD-ROM to the local hard drive because the data transferred from the CD-ROM
will be corrupted during this process as well.

Additional query words: 1.00 audio video
