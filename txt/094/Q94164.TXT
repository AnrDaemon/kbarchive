-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Printing from the Microsoft Windows Accessories applications (Notepad, Calendar,
Cardfile) to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 printer using the HP LaserJet
4/4M printer driver (HPPCL5E.DRV) version 31.1.03 may cause incorrect output,
such as inconsistent margins.

A general protection (GP) fault may also occur when printing from these
accessories.


CAUSE
=====

Notepad, Cardfile, and Calendar do not support a resolution setting of 600 dpi.
Therefore, the LaserJet 4 printer may fail to print correctly if the resolution
is set to 600 dpi.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - Select 300 dpi printer as the resolution in the Printer Setup.

-or-

 - Use the HP LaserJet III printer driver. (This is the least-desired method
   because of the absence of the resolution enhancement option built into the
   newer HP LJ4 driver.)

 - Change the left and right margin each to 1 inch.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
