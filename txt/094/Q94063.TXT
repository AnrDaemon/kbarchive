TITLE   :LAN Man Setup Hangs with Two [tcpip_node] Sections
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

After the upgrade from LAN Manager 2.1a to 2.2 has completed, LANMAN.INI has two
sections of [tcpip_node]--the first one is left blank and the original one is
appended to the end of the file.

CAUSE
=====

The LAN Manager 2.1a Setup program does not fully recognize the section
[tcpip_node] in LANMAN.INI.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must remove the blank, first [tcpip_node] section for two reasons:

 - Because it is blank, [tcpip_node] may not initialize correctly due to blank
   parameters.

 - Two [tcpip_node] sections in LANMAN.INI will hang the Setup program during
   upgrade after copying all the files from the Drivers 1 disk. The dialog box
   "Please Wait..." will not disappear.

Additional query words: install tcp/ip 2.20 2.2 2.10a 2.1a
