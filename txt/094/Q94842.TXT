SUMMARY
=======

An attempt to use of the audit functions in the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax
fails and the following error occurs:

   Notice 153: Error reading CDR file

This error indicates that the log directory of the Microsoft Mail Postoffice does
not contain a FAXCDR.LOG file. The fax gateway automatically creates this file
and adds an entry for each outgoing message.

The CDR (Call Detail Record in the LOG\FAXCDR.LOG file) contains accounting
information for each transmission of a fax item by users on the LAN.

For more information, please refer to the section titled "The Call Detail Record
File" in the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax Administrator's Guide" for version
3.0.
