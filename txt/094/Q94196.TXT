SUMMARY
=======

There may be situations in which you need to reinstall Microsoft Windows to
troubleshoot a problem possibly related to file corruption or accidental
deletion of files from the Windows directory or the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
In most cases, it is not advisable to simply reinstall over an existing Windows
installation because with that procedure, some files may not be properly
updated.

Installing Windows to a new directory ensures a "clean" installation; however,
any modifications to Windows initialization (.INI) files or the registration
database (REG.DAT) are lost with such an installation. Also, programs that
install files into the Windows directory, such as Microsoft Word for Windows and
Microsoft Excel, cannot run from the new copy of Windows. Any Windows-based
applications must be reinstalled under the new installation of Windows.
Furthermore, any customization of Program Manager groups, desktop colors and
wallpaper, screen-saver settings, and other user-defined environment settings
must be re-created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following steps to reinstall Windows 3.1 without losing current
settings, such as .INI and REG.DAT file modifications, customized Program
Manager groups (.GRPs), and other desktop settings.

1. Install Windows into a new directory, such as C:\WIN. Verify that Windows
   runs from this new directory.

   If Windows ran during installation but does not run from this new directory,
   something has changed on the computer, or file corruption has occurred since
   Windows was installed. The following causes should be considered:

    - Changes to the path

    - Deletion of files from the Windows directory

    - Low conventional memory

    - File corruption

    - Hardware failures

2. In this new installation, rename the .GRP files using .GRN, the .INI files
   using .INN, and the .FOT files (located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory)
   using .FOZ. Rename the REG.DAT file using REG.DAN. To do this, quit Windows
   and type the following commands at an MS-DOS command prompt:

   rename c:\win\*.grp *.grn
   rename c:\win\*.ini *.inn
   rename c:\win\reg.dat reg.dan
   rename c:\win\system\*.fot *.foz

   NOTE: The *.FOT files have an internal direct path to the *.TTF files, which
   if copied to the old C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, can create problems with
   the fonts after the C:\WIN directory is removed.

3. Remove the Read-Only attribute from any files in the C:\WINDOWS and
   C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories. Copy all the files from the new installation
   into the original Windows directory (C:\WINDOWS) by typing the following at
   an MS-DOS command prompt:

   attrib -s -h c:\windows\*.* /s
   attrib -r c:\windows\*.* /s
   xcopy c:\win c:\windows /s

   If Windows now runs from the C:\WINDOWS directory, the reinstallation has been
   successful, and no settings were lost. To save disk space, delete the C:\WIN
   directory from File Manager or from MS-DOS version 6.0 or later using the
   DELTREE command. Also, delete files with the extensions .INN, .GRN, and the
   file REG.DAN in the C:\WINDOWS directory, and the files ending with .FOZ in
   the C:WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

   If Windows does not run, continue with the following steps.

4. Rename the original .INI files using .INO, and rename the .INN files using
   .INI as follows:

   rename c:\windows\*.ini *.ino
   rename c:\windows\*.inn *.ini

   Edit the PROGMAN.INI file and replace all occurrences of C:\WIN with
   C:\WINDOWS.

   If Windows runs now, the problem is being caused by a corruption or improper
   setting in one of the original .INI files. The best solution is to back up
   all data files from Windows-based applications and then reinstall the
   applications. This ensures the correct WIN.INI, SYSTEM.INI, and directory
   settings for each application. Note that you must re-create any customization
   of Program Manager groups and desktop settings.

   To free up disk space, delete excess files as shown in step 3 above.

5. If Windows does not run now, back up all application data files and reinstall
   the applications under the new Windows installation after renaming the .INN,
   .GRN, .FOZ, and REG.DAN files as follows:

   rename c:\win\*.inn *.ini
   rename c:\win\*.grn *.grp
   rename c:\win\reg.dan reg.dat
   rename c:\win\system\*.foz *.fot
