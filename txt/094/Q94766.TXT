TITLE   :Workstation Not Showing Status w/Print Mgr Minimized on Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Print Manager is minimized on a Windows for Workgroups server that is
sharing a printer, the Print Manager on another workstation that sends print
jobs becomes idle as soon as the job is sent (not when the job is finished
printing). Usually, the Print Manager on the workstation would display the
current status of the print job and of the printer.

CAUSE
=====

The Print Manager on the workstation checks and displays the network printer
status when it is first loaded; however, if the Print Manager on the printer
server is minimized, the network printer's status is not updated.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run the Print Manager on the server maximized so
that Windows for Workgroups workstations can monitor their print jobs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups versions
3.1 and 3.11.
