TITLE   :BUG: Redirected CodeView Output Yields Unexpected Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.05,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.05, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the CodeView debugger command line specifies the output redirection
operator (>) and the user invokes an MS-DOS shell in CodeView, the output
from any commands executed in the MS-DOS shell is included in the file created
by the output redirection.

RESOLUTION
==========

Command line output redirection works without problem if the user does not
invoke an MS-DOS shell. If the user invokes an MS-DOS shell, operation occurs
"in the dark" because application prompts and your responses do not appear on
the screen. The redirection places this information in the output file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView versions 4.0, 4.01,
4.05, and 4.1 for MS-DOS. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A redirection operator on the MS-DOS command line captures into a file all
output to the standard output device (stdout). Output to the standard error
device (stderr) is not affected.
