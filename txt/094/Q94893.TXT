SUMMARY
=======

The archive attribute (a) on the MS-DOS Shell file DOSSHELL.INI is not set when
modifications are made to the MS-DOS Shell that require rewriting the
DOSSHELL.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The archive attribute is used to mark files that have changed. The MS-DOS
commands BACKUP, RESTORE and XCOPY can use the archive attribute.

Configuration information is written to DOSSHELL.INI when changes are made to the
MS-DOS Shell.

WORKAROUND
==========

To set the archive attribute on the DOSSHELL.INI, type the following at the
MS-DOS command prompt

   " attrib +a <path>\dosshell.ini" (without the quotation marks)

where <path> is the drive and directory where your MS-DOS files currently
reside. For example, if your MS-DOS files are on drive C in the DOS directory,
type the following:

   " attrib +a c:\dos\dosshell.ini" (without the quotation marks)
