-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

MS-DOS-based programs run in monochrome on older 8514/a video cards.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a design limitation of the original IBM 8514/a video
cards.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you have an 8514/a card installed, it uses the VGA card for pass- through
video. When you connect your monitor to the 8514/a output jack, the VGA port is
left empty. Some applications read this open port as a monochrome monitor and
switch to two-color mode when running VGA. Newer VGA cards default to color when
the port is open. The same applications run in color on these 8514/a video
cards.

If you run a Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) report on one of these machines, you see
the current mode listed as VGA Monochrome (two color). The only way to get the
applications to run in color is to plug the monitor into the VGA port while you
boot the machine so that it initializes as color and then plug the monitor into
the 8514/a port. VGA mode remains in color until the machine is rebooted. This
change should be reflected in virtually all the MS-DOS-based applications.

NOTE: This does work on the 8514/a emulator cards because they are the only video
card in the system and no port is left open.
