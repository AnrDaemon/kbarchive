SUMMARY
=======

You can't use the On Error Goto and On Event Gosub statements in a form because
they require an event handler at the module level, and you can't enter code at
the module level of a form.

Attempting to enter code at the module level of a form results in an error:

   Executable code not allowed in module level of a form

Line labels and line numbers are allowed in the module level of a form module,
but they are useless.

To work around this limitation, use On Error and On Event statements only in code
(.BAS) modules or use the On Local Error statement for error trapping.

MORE INFORMATION
================

   On Error       On Com
   On Key         On Pen
   On Play        On Strig
