SUMMARY
=======

An application developed with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) can define a
macro that controls the code generated for the procedure prologue and epilogue.
The prologue macro must return a value.

Page 206 of the Microsoft Macro Assembler "Programmer's Guide" for MASM 6.0, and
page 202 of the same manual for MASM 6.1 includes the following statement
regarding the return value for the prologue macro:

   Your macro function must return the parmbytes parameter.

This statement is incorrect and should be corrected to read as follows:

   Your macro function should return the localbytes parameter.

The sample prologue macro provided on page 207 for MASM 6.0 and page 203 for MASM
6.1 also contains an error because it returns the %bytecount parameter instead
of the %numlocals parameter. Correct the EXITM statement in the macro to read as
follows:

   EXITM %numlocals

Additional query words: 6.00 6.00a 6.00b 6.10 6.10a
