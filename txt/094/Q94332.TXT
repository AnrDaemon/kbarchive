======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If DBLSPACE /RATIO or other DoubleSpace commands cause the system to restart,
load DBLSPACE.SYS before your network drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup installs DBLSPACE.SYS before any network drivers, so this problem should
not occur unless you have moved the DBLSPACE.SYS driver in the CONFIG.SYS file.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.20 Autoreboot reboot warmboot coldboot cold warm boot re-boot re-start
