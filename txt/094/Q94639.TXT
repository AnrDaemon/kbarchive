Troubleshooting Microsoft Backup for Windows and Microsoft Backup
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Microsoft does not recommend or support running the MS-DOS-based version of
   Microsoft Backup (MSBACKUP.EXE) with Windows. If you choose to do this, you
   should create a program information file (PIF) with the following settings
   for Microsoft Backup:

       Display Usage: Full Screen
       Execution:  Exclusive

2. Your CONFIG.SYS file should include the following settings (the values shown
   are minimums):

       FILES=30
       BUFFERS=30
       STACKS=9,256

3. The DMABufferSize= line should be set to at least 32 in the [386Enh] section
   of the SYSTEM.INI file. In some situations, the DMA buffer size needs to be
   set to 40 (either in the SYSTEM.INI file, or using EMM386.EXE, or both).

4. If you are using MSBACKUP.EXE in Windows or the Windows version of Microsoft
   Backup (MWBACKUP.EXE), you should place the following line in your SYSTEM.INI
   file if Setup did not install it:

      device=c:\dos\vfintd.386

   If you omit this line, Backup displays the following error message:

   Microsoft Backup is not properly installed on this system.

   Please reinstall Microsoft Backup, or make the following changes to your
   SYSTEM.INI file:

   [386Enh]
   DEVICE=[ms-dos path]VFINTD.386
