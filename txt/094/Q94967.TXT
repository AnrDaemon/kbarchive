SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax may experience "Connection Error" problems
when it is used with the Intel SatisFAXtion/200 fax board.

Intel Corporation has created a new driver for its SatisFAXtion/200 board, called
DOWNLOAD.200. To install this driver, copy it to the root directory of the boot
disk.

The driver corrects problems if you use the SatisFAXtion software, even if you do
not use the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax. The README.TXT file, also available
from Intel, lists the problems that it resolves.

In the United States, you can obtain the driver directly from Intel Corporation
through its FAXBack Service. To use the FAXBack Service, you must have a
Touch-Tone telephone and a SatisFAXtion board. To obtain the driver, perform
these six steps:

1. Boot your computer that contains the fax board and start the SatisFAXtion
   software.

2. Use a Touch-Tone telephone to call the FAXBack service at (800) 525-3019.

3. Follow the voice directions for the download service. The document identifier
   is 0028. The system prompts for the telephone number to which the
   SatisFAXtion board is connected.

4. Hang up the phone and the FAXBack service downloads the driver to the
   SatisFAXtion board. (The status indicator in the SatisFAXtion software
   indicates when the download is complete.)

5. Select the Receive attachment option to read the README.TXT file.

6. Copy the new DOWNLOAD.200 file to the root directory of the boot disk.
