-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During installation of MS-DOS Upgrade Setup does not delete IBM PC-DOS, Digital
DR DOS, or Novell DOS system files; instead, it leaves them in the root of the
startup drive (usually drive C). Their existence can cause a variety of
unexpected behavior including the following:

 - The system stops responding (hangs)

 - Keyboard problems

 - File Manager problems

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid these and other problems, delete the IBM, DR DOS, or Novell DOS system
files. To do this, you need to first remove the files' hidden, system, and
read-only file attributes by typing the following at the root directory MS-DOS
command prompt:

   " attrib -r -s -h ibm*.com " (without the quotation marks)

After you remove these attributes, you can delete the files with the MS-DOS
DELETE command by typing the following at the root directory MS-DOS command
prompt:

   " del ibm*.com " (without the quotation marks)

If you are using MS-DOS 6.0 or later, you can delete the IBM, DR DOS, or Novell
DOS system files using the DELTREE program without having to use the ATTRIB
program. For example, type "deltree /y c:\ibm*.com" (without the quotation
marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

WARNING: Do not remove the IBM, DR DOS, or Novell DOS system files if you think
you might remove your current version of MS-DOS. After you delete the IBM, DR
DOS, or Novell DOS system files, you cannot remove your current version of
MS-DOS using the Uninstall disk.
