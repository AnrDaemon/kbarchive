The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using VidEdit to combine several files, you can avoid unnecessary
additional compression by choosing No Change from the Video Compression Method
under the Compression Option when saving the file, or when setting the
Compression Options under the Video menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An example of recompression is the combining of two files created using the
ActionMedia II card and Indeo Compression into a single Indeo file (or even
after just editing an Indeo file) and choosing Save As from the Edit menu with
Indeo selected as the compression method. This recompresses the file(s) using
the Indeo compression again, which in turn can cause a greater degradation of
the data.

By choosing the No Change option under Video Compression Method, you continue to
use the compression scheme of the original file loaded without a recompression.

Recompression could also take place when combining two files of one compression
scheme and saving the file using a different compression scheme.
