SUMMARY
=======

If you run MemMaker with a third-party disk compression program, such as Stacker
or SuperStor, MemMaker cannot undo the changes in the CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files after a failed boot attempt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a reboot attempt fails, MemMaker provides a Cancel button to undo changes.
MemMaker attempts to undo all changes to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
on the host drive but cannot because the compressed drive in no longer mounted.

Although MemMaker correctly detects compression on the system and verifies that
the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files match, the problem still occurs because
CHKSTATE.SYS is loaded before the disk-compression software. MemMaker is able to
restore the files on the host drive, but not on the compressed volume (which is
swapped with the host AFTER the disk- compression software is loaded).

To restore your computer to its previous state, copy and rename the AUTOEXEC.UMB
and CONFIG.UMB files from the host drive to the compressed volume after you
choose the MemMaker Cancel option. For example, if drive D is the uncompressed
host drive and drive C is the compressed volume, use the following commands:

   copy d:\autoexec.umb c:\autoexec.bat
   copy d:\config.umb c:\config.sys
