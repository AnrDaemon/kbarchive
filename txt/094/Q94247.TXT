 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you are using Windows Sound System and a SNDSYS.DRV entry is not present in
the [DRIVERS] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, the following error may occur:

   Cannot find the SNDSYS Driver

Correctly setting up the [DRIVERS] section in the SYSTEM.INI file may correct
this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can be caused if the [Drivers] section in the SYSTEM.INI file is
not set up correctly.

This section should be configured in the following manner:

   [DRIVERS]
   MIDIMAPPER=MIDIMAP.DRV
   TIMER=TIMER.DRV
   WAVE=SNDSYS.DRV
   AUX=SNDSYS.DRV
   MIDI=SNDSYS.DRV
   WAVEMAPPER=MSACM.DRV

If WAVE=SNDSYS.DRV is not present, Volume Control, Recording Control, Voice
Pilot, Quick Recorder, and Sound Finder will not load. Also, if AUX=SNDSYS.DRV
is not present, Volume Control, Recording Control, Voice Pilot, and Sound Finder
will also not load.

NOTE: This message can also occur if in the "drivers=" line is missing from the
[boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI, This line usually reads as follows:

   drivers=mmsystem.dll

If this line is missing, use a text editor (such as Notepad) to edit your
SYSTEM.INI file, and re-enter the line.
