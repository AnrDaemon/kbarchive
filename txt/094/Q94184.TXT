The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For security reasons, users' online calendar files for version 1.0 and 1.0a
of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows are not named with each user's name. To
locate a specific user's online calendar file (for example, if the file is
damaged), use the MVCAL utility by typing the following command:

   mvcal <username> -d<drive letter> -p<password>

This utility finds the calendar file for the user name specified and
renames it <username>.BAD. The -d option specifies the postoffice drive and
the -p option specifies the Schedule+ administrator's password.

After the calendar file is renamed, a new file will be created the next
time the user signs in.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MVCAL utility is included with Application Note WA0641, "Database
Maintenance Utilities." You can have this Application Note mailed or faxed to
you by contacting Microsoft Product Support Services.
