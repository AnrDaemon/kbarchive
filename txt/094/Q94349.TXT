The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Documents developed with the Text Merge feature can use fields from two or more
databases. The example below uses customer names and addresses from the FoxPro
2.x CUSTOMER.DBF sample database merged with form letters contained in memo
fields from a second database (INVOICE.DBF).

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This example only works using the FoxPro 2.x sample files.

The memo field contains all text to be merged. Page spacing (top, bottom, and
side margins) is controlled within the memo field. A memo field can appear
similar to the following example:

   <<DATE()>>

   <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(CONTACT))>>
   <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(COMPANY))>>
   <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(ADDRESS))>>
   <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(CITY))>>, <<ALLTRIM(STATE)>> <<ALLTRIM(ZIP)>>

   Dear <<ALLTRIM(PROPER(CONTACT))>>:

   This area includes the body of a letter to be
   sent to the contact.

   Sincerely,

   Name

   ENDTEXT

The following program connects the information from the two databases. Work area
1 includes the database (INVOICE) with memo fields that contain form letters.
Work area 2 includes a database (CUSTOMER) that contains names and addresses
that should receive the letter. The program will execute from work area 2.

This example assumes that you have a customer database (CUSTOMER) with account
status information and a database (INVOICE) with multiple form letters for
different account statuses.

      SELECT 1
      USE INVOICE
      SELECT 2
      USE CUSTOMER
      CLEAR                               && Clear screen.
      SET TEXTMERGE ON                    && Enable evaluation of components.
      SET TALK OFF                        && Prevent printing of commands.
      SET TEXTMERGE DELIMITERS TO         && Set default delimiters.
      SET MEMOWIDTH TO 80                 && Set memo width for 80 columns.
      SCAN                                && Force top-down processing.
        FOR J=1 TO MEMLINES(invoice.memo)
           X="\"+MLINE(invoice.memo,J)  && Process each line in memo field.
           &X                        && Macro substitution.
        ENDFOR
      ENDSCAN
