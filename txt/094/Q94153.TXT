SUMMARY
=======

If you use the printer driver for the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M
(HPPCL5E.DRV) version 1.03 or 1.04 and any version of Adobe Type Manager (ATM),
colors assigned to objects (text and graphics) may be remapped incorrectly if
you are printing in HP-GL/2 graphics mode.

To work around this problem, use one of the following workarounds:

1. Change the graphics mode to Raster.

2. If you want HP-GL/2 graphics and ATM fonts are not needed for the output,
   turn off ATM temporarily and print the file.

3. If the problem concerns a graphics object only and ATM fonts are needed but
   only in black, try changing the colors of the graphics object until an
   acceptable output is achieved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For graphics objects, this problem occurs because the color remapping is being
performed twice for the same object. When you print the document, ATM remaps the
colors based on its remapping criteria, then the HPPCL5E driver remaps the
colors chosen by ATM based on its own criteria. This increases the chance of
error in what gray scale color is sent to the printer.

All ATM text prints as black in HP-GL/2 graphics mode because of a mismatch
between raster operations (ROPs) and HP-GL/2 graphics mode.

For more information, contact Hewlett-Packard Technical Support.
