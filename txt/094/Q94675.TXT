SYMPTOMS
========

When printing to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4/4M, horizontal and vertical
lines (black or white) may appear throughout the image if the printer has low
memory. This problem occurs when W1 Image Adapt (LOSSY) compression mode is
engaged with an application that performs its own banding (such as Microsoft
Paintbrush).

WORKAROUND
==========

Use any of the following three methods to avoid this problem.

 - Try printing the file at a lower resolution. Selecting a lower resolution
   requires less printer memory.

 - Make the image smaller.

 - Add more memory to the printer.
