The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a table, the error message

   "Memo File is Missing/Invalid"

appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy a valid memo file over the corrupt memo file to access the database again.

NOTE: The original memo field information will be lost unless the valid memo file
was an exact backup of the corrupt file. All memo field backup files have an
extension of .TBK.

The corrupt memo file will have an .FPT extension, such as OLD.FPT. In the
following example, assume NEW.FPT is a valid memo file. To bypass the error
message and access the database again, type the following command at the MS- DOS
command prompt:

   

      copy new.fpt old.fpt

The new memo file being used can be from any database that has a valid memo field
associated with it. This allows the database to be opened in FoxPro again.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
