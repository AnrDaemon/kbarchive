-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a device= statement for SMARTDRV.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS file, but
you are not using the /DOUBLE_BUFFER switch, MemMaker may change the device=
statement to devicehigh=. If so, you receive the following error message:

   Double-buffering driver cannot be loaded into a UMB. Do not use the
   devicehigh command or other load-high utilities to load Smartdrv.exe

CAUSE
=====

MemMaker recognizes and ignores the device= statement for SMARTDRV.EXE only if
you are using the /DOUBLE_BUFFER switch.

A device= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file does not load the SMARTDrive cache; it
loads only the double-buffering device driver embedded in the SMARTDRV.EXE file.
This device driver cannot be loaded into upper memory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, in the CONFIG.SYS file, change the devicehigh=
statement for SMARTDRV.EXE to device= and add the /DOUBLE_BUFFER switch, then
run MemMaker again.
