SUMMARY
=======

If you modify a printer description in the CONTROL.INF file or the
[PrinterPorts] section of the WIN.INI file, an incorrect printer name may appear
in the Setup dialog box of the Control Panel. The name that appears in the Setup
dialog box varies depending on the printer driver you are using.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The name of the printer listed in the Installed Printers box is derived from the
[PrinterPorts] section of WIN.INI. You may want to customize this name to
provide information about the printer. If you do so, the customized name appears
in the Installed Printers box; however, customizing the name may cause an
incorrect printer name to be displayed in the Setup dialog box.

This problem only occurs if you are using either the UNIDRV.DLL or the
PSCRIPT.DRV driver; it does not occur if you are using the HPPCL5A.DRV driver.
If you use either UNIDRV.DLL or PSCRIPT.DRV, the customized printer name is
compared to an internal list of printers. If a match is not found, a default
printer name is assigned based on the printer driver you are using.

For example, the EPSON9.DRV driver defaults to the printer name Epson MX-80,
whereas the PSCRIPT.DRV driver defaults to the printer name Apple LaserWriter
Plus. If a printer name is customized and the printer driver's default printer
name matches the installed printer, the change works properly.

Another way to customize a printer name is to change the name in the CONTROL.INF
file. This causes the new name to appear in the "List of Printers" box that you
get when you choose Add in the "Printers" dialog box. When installed, the
customized printer name is written to the WIN.INI file and the above problem may
exist.

The following is a list of printer drivers and the default printer name with
which they are associated:
