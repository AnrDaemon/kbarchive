SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Golf issues the error statement "Bad or missing RealSound driver
[vrsd.386]" in the Current Sound Driver portion of the System Info dialog box
if:

1. VRSD.386 was not installed properly in the SYSTEM subdirectory of the WINDOWS
   directory.

2. The line DEVICE=VRSD.386 is not under the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file.

3. The VRSD.386 file is corrupt.

Solution
--------

1. If the VRSD.386 file is corrupt or does not exist in the SYSTEM subdirectory
   of Windows, you must expand it from the Setup Disk 1. Also, make sure it is
   not in the WINDOWS directory or the MSGOLF directory. If you find it in
   either place, you need to delete it.

2. Exit Windows and switch to the SYSTEM subdirectory of the WINDOWS directory.

3. Insert Golf Disk 1 in your floppy disk drive.

4. Type the following

   expand <drive>:\vrsd.38_ vrsd.386.

   where <drive> is the name of your floppy disk drive.

5. Restart Windows and run Golf.
