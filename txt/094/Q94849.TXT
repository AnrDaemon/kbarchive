The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using any video driver with a resolution higher than 640 x 480, the Main
View in Microsoft Golf doesn't seem to correctly maximize. The Main View doesn't
utilize the whole screen. This is by design and it is maximizing correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The courses used in Golf are taken from video tapes that are digitized into the
computer. You can only display the courses in the two sizes. You can changed the
screen resolution, but this doesn't affect the displayed sizes of the courses.

The screen shots in the manual and on the packaging are taken using 640 x 480
screen resolution with 256 colors.
