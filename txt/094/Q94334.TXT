TITLE   :Using MS-DOS Upgrade Fdisk Program with EXTDISK.SYS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If were using COMPAQ MS-DOS version 4.0 or later before you upgraded to MS-DOS
6.0 or later, and you are using EXTDISK.SYS, you should use the COMPAQ version
of the Fdisk program. If you were using COMPAQ MS-DOS version 3.31 or earlier
before you upgraded to MS-DOS 6.0 or later, and you are using EXTDISK.SYS, you
should contact Compaq for an updated version of EXTDISK.SYS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some COMPAQ systems use a driver called EXTDISK.SYS to access secondary disk
drives. This driver is MS-DOS version-dependent. If you use the MS-DOS version
of Fdisk when EXTDISK.SYS is loaded, Fdisk displays incorrect drive letters for
the hard disks attached to the second controller.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by using the COMPAQ version of Fdisk. To
install the old version of Fdisk:

1. Delete FDISK.EXE from the DOS directory.

2. Copy FDISK.* from your COMPAQ MS-DOS disks to your DOS directory. For
   example:

      copy a:\fdisk.* c:\dos

3. Add Fdisk to the SETVER.EXE version table for your version of COMPAQ MS-DOS.
   For example:

      setver fdisk.exe 4.0

4. Restart your computer.

NOTE: You must use SETVER to tell EXTDISK.SYS that you are using a previous
version of MS-DOS. For more information, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " MS-DOS and SETVER and EXTDISK.SYS " (without the quotation marks)
