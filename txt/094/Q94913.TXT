SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to assemble an application fails and the assembler generates the
following message:

   error A2156: constant value out of range

If you assemble the application and request a listing file, the assembler
generates a very large listing file or it generates the following message:

   DOSXNT : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception:

   General protection fault;

   contact Microsoft Support Services

CAUSE
=====

The application contains a PAGE directive and the length or width values are
outside the range of valid values.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the PAGE directive so that the length parameter is between 10 and 255
lines and the width parameter is between 60 and 255 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b,
6.1, and 6.1a. This problem was corrected in MASM for MS-DOS version 6.11.
