The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Tandy 1000TX 286 computers have a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive that can be
configured as a 360K drive. If the drive has been reconfigured, the MS-DOS 6.x
OEM 720K Disk 1 will not start (boot) the computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Modify or create the CONFIG.SYS file on Disk 1, and add the following line:

      DRIVPARM=/d:0 /f:2

2. Boot the system using this disk.

Setup should now run normally.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 6.20
