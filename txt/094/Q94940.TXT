SUMMARY
=======

Interlnk cannot access CD-ROM drives or network drives.

Interlnk accesses drives using a block device driver. This means that Interlnk
can recognize standard drives, but not network drives. Because CD-ROM drives use
a network interface, Interlnk cannot be used to access them.

NOTE: The MS-DOS SUBST utility uses the redirector hooks introduced in MS-DOS
version 3.3 and later; therefore, SUBST drives are treated (in most respects) as
network drives, and Interlnk cannot access them.

Additional query words: 6.22 6.00 interlink inter link 6.20
