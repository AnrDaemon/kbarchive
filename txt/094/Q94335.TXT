TITLE   :DoubleSpace Installation Fails to Update SYSTEM.INI File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you have multiple installations of Windows on your hard drive, DoubleSpace may
not correctly update the SYSTEM.INI file.

CAUSE
=====

Windows stores the location of the permanent swapfile in the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file. When you install DoubleSpace, it must find the SYSTEM.INI
file and update the PermSwapDosDrive= setting to point to the correct drive. If
you have multiple copies of Windows installed, or Windows is not in the path,
DoubleSpace cannot find the SYSTEM.INI file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, edit the SYSTEM.INI file and change the drive
letter for the PermSwapDosDrive= setting to the DoubleSpace host drive. For
example, if Windows is installed on drive C: and you installed DoubleSpace,
creating drive H:, you would need to edit you SYSTEM.INI file and change the
PermSwapDosDrive=c to PermSwapDosDrive=h.
