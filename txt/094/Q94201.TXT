The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The TopDesk program included with the Windows Resource Kit for Windows version
3.1 prevents many of the Sound Events included with Microsoft SoundBits from
functioning correctly. Closing TopDesk allows all of the Sound Events to operate
normally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft SoundBits includes a Sound Events "hook," which allows Windows' users
to attach sounds to specific system events, such as minimizing and maximizing
Windows, opening and closing applications, and starting and exiting Windows.
Under normal circumstances, this "hook" plays whatever sound is assigned to a
system event when that event occurs.

If TopDesk is running, however, sounds will not play when certain system events
occur. Among the Sound Events that DO NOT function with TopDesk are the
following:

   Application Maximize
   Application Minimize
   Application Open
   Application Restore Down
   Application Restore Up
   Control Panel Minimize
   Control Panel Open
   Control Panel Restore Up
   File Manager Minimize
   File Manager Open
   File Manager Restore Up
   MBrowser Minimize
   MBrowser Open
   MBrowser Restore Up
   Program Manager Minimize
   Program Manager Restore Up
   Sound Recorder Open
   WinHelp Minimize
   WinHelp Open
   WinHelp Restore Up

The only way to allow these Sound Events to operate correctly is to close
TopDesk.
