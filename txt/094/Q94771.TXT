SUMMARY
=======

Although the Star Micronics model SG-10 printer is not a supported printer in
Windows 3.1, it is possible to configure this printer so it prints correctly.
Setting the printer to use the IBM character set and using the Epson FX-80
printer driver allows this printer to print correctly in Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting the IBM Character Set
-----------------------------

The print modes of the SG-10 are changed, with DIP switches located on the right
side of the printer. There are two banks of switches. The rear bank contains
eight switches, designated 1-1 through 1-8, from back to front. The forward bank
contains four switches, designated 2-1 through 2-4, from back to front.

The SG-10 prints correctly when all switches excluding switch 2-2 are in the up
position. Switch 2-2 must be down. White horizontal bands will appear through
text and graphics if switch 2-2 is left in the up position.

The Star Micronics products included here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
