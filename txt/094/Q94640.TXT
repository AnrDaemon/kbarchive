SUMMARY
=======

If you receive an invalid password error when accessing a shared ClipBook page
on another machine, the password may not have been entered from the user
interface provided in ClipBook. The standard user interface automatically
converts all entries to uppercase characters, and the programmable interface
NDDEShareAdd does not. If the password was not entered in uppercase characters,
the passwords, though identical in all other respects, do not match.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All passwords must be in uppercase characters before calling NDDEShareAdd. The
application program interface (API) does not change the password characters to
uppercase automatically. The API encrypts the passwords in lowercase characters.
On the server, the password characters entered in the password dialog box are
automatically changed to uppercase. The encrypted versions of both passwords are
compared as binary, and if different strings are encrypted, the comparison
fails.

Tests that use a user interface to have the user enter the password always work
because that user interface changes the password characters to uppercase before
calling NDDEShareAdd.

NOTE: Only applications with mixed-case strings in their data or resources
exhibit this problem.

NDDEShareAdd is a NetDDE command. This only affects users that have created their
own NetDDE applications, are using a third-party NetDDE application, or are
accessing the NetDDE interface by using an applications DDE interface.
