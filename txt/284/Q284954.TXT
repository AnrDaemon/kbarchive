TITLE   :XADM: Extra Read Receipt May Be Sent from Delegate
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send mail with a request for a read receipt to a recipient who has an
autoforward rule set up for a delegate, if the mail recipient and the delegate
are on different servers, an additional read receipt is generated from the
delegate to the mail recipient. You receive a read receipt from the mail
recipient when the mail item is read, as expected. No additional read receipt is
received if the recipient and delegate are on the same server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because when the delegate opens the mail message, the check
that is made to determine whether to generate a read receipt does not verify
whether or not the message was autoforwarded.

RESOLUTION
==========

correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
