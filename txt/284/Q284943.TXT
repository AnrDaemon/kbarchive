The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a Windows 95 Startup disk in MS-DOS.

This article is based on the assumption that the system files on the hard drive
are in good condition, and are not corrupted, or that you have access to a
functioning Windows 95-based computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   F8, and then choose Command Prompt Only on the Startup menu, or open an
   MS-DOS window inside of Windows 95.

2. Insert a blank, non-write protected floppy disk in the floppy disk drive (if
   you use a disk that has any data on it, the data will be lost).

3. Type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each command. Do not
   include the comments that are included in parentheses.

   "format a: /s" (without the quotation marks) (this will copy over
   Command.com, IO.sys, Msdos.sys, and if the hard drive is compressed,
   Drvspace.bin)

   "copy c:\windows\command\attrib.exe a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\chkdsk.exe a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\debug.exe a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\edit.com a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\fdisk.exe a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\format.com a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\scandisk.exe a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\scandisk.ini a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\sys.com a:" (without the quotation marks)

   "copy c:\windows\command\drvspace.bin a:" (without the quotation marks)
   (format /s will copy this over if the drive is compressed)

   "copy c:\windows\regedit.exe a:" (without the quotation marks)

4. Uninstal.exe is found in the Win95_02.cab file, and it must be extracted.
   This file is only needed if you are planning on uninstalling Windows 95.

5. Ebd.sys is an empty file that is included on the EBD made by Windows, but it
   is not necessary.
