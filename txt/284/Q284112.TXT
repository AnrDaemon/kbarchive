======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
 - Indexing Service, included with:
    - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
    - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
    - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you query a catalog that contains content from indexing Web sites, as well
as content from indexing physical directories, and you use a "SortBy=Rank" and
"OrderBy=[D]" (descending) query, the filename property in the result may be
missing and the path property only contains the directory and not
directory+filename.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the vpath element is listed in the columns' property
before the path element. For example:

   Q.Columns = "vpath, path, filename, DocTitle, Write, Size, Rank"

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, place the path element in the columns' property
before the vpath element. For example:

   Q.Columns = "path, vpath, filename, DocTitle, Write, Size, Rank"

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
