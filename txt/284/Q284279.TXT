PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Developer Network Subscriptions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

MSDN Subscriptions no longer contain an installable index to find specific
products within the subscription CD-ROMs. The index CD now contains an index in
the form of a Microsoft Access database for reference.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The best resource for this information is through the MSDN Subscription Online
CD Index:

   http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/index/default.asp
   (http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/index/default.asp)

The alternative is to view the index from the Development Platform CD1 under the
Index folder on versions of the MSDN Universal or Professional Subscription
prior to January 2001 and within the Index CD for January 2001 and later.

Additional query words: vs6, vssetup, msdnlib
