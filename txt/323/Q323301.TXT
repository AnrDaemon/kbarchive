TITLE   :The YPCAT Command May Produce Unexpected Results
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0, if you run the ypcat command against the
"netgroup.byuser" or "netgroup.byhost" map, the results may be incomplete. This
might cause a UNIX client not to be able to use network resources if the
client's logon process depends on parsing the results of the command.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the "netgroup.byuser" or "netgroup.byhost" map
contains a hyphen (-) or a null entry ("").

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the ypcat command to query the "netgroup" map. Group the results by user.
You can also use the ypmatch command against the "netgroup" map to obtain the
same results.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
