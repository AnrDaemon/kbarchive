TITLE   :"Random Sponsors" Option Doesn't Work on HIS End-User Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 End-User Client always connects to
sponsor servers in the order in which they are listed in the SNA Resource
Location Wizard, even if the "Select SNA Service computer in random order" (also
known as the Random Sponsors) option is selected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the routine used by the HIS 2000 End-User Client to
place the configured sponsor servers in the client's service table does not
randomly add the sponsor servers when the "Select SNA Service computer in random
order" option is selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.
