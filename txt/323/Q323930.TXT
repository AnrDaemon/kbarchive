MORE INFORMATION
================

To import an aircraft and aircraft gauges from Flight Simulator 2000 into Flight
Simulator 2002, follow these steps.

NOTE: Flight Simulator 2000 and Flight Simulator 2002 contain gauge files that
have the same file names. Do not overwrite the existing Flight Simulator 2002
gauge files with earlier versions of the gauge files.

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. Locate and then open the Aircraft folder of the Flight Simulator 2000
   installation. By default, the Aircraft folder is in the following location:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2000\Aircraft

3. Drag the aircraft files that you want to import to the Aircraft folder of the
   Flight Simulator 2002 installation. By default, the Aircraft folder is in the
   following location:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Aircraft

4. Locate and then open the Gauges folder of the Flight Simulator 2000
   installation. By default, the Gauges folder is in the following location:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2000\Gauges

5. Drag the gauge files that you want to import to the Gauges folder of the
   Flight Simulator 2002 installation. (For example, for the Concorde, drag the
   Concorde.GAU file.) By default, the Gauges folder is in the following
   location:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Gauges

   NOTE: When you drag the gauge files, click No if you are prompted to confirm
   replacing the file.
