TITLE   :SMS: Status Messages Are Not Processed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a new Status Filter rule in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator console, no new status messages may be processed or summarized at
the site. This may occur no matter how you configured the rule, or where you put
the rule in the list of Status Filter rules. When this problem occurs, the
following entry may be recorded in the Statmgr.log file when the
SMS_STATUS_MANAGER component starts:

   ERROR: The component item for SMS_STATUS_MANAGER in the master site control
   file does not contain property list items for a status filter named
   "SMS_STATUS_MANAGER", or those property lists are corrupt or badly formatted.

Additionally, the following log entry may be recorded many times:

   Sleeping for 60 seconds...
   A new version of the master site control file is not available yet.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if there are leading or trailing spaces in the name of
the Status Filter rule. Note that the name of a Status Filter rule can contain
up to 1,024 characters, but only the first 250 characters appear in the SMS
Administrator console.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this issue, make sure that Status Filter rule names do not contain
leading or trailing spaces. If a Status Filter rule name contains a leading or
trailing space, you must delete the rule and then re-create it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
