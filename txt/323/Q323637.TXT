SYMPTOMS
========

You are an MSN subscriber running MSN Explorer, Spanish version 7.2 and want to
change your connection settings. You are not able to do so because there is no
Connection Settings link on the Spanish-U.S. MSN Explorer sign-in screen.

CAUSE
=====

Because the Spanish-U.S. MSN Explorer is targeted for free users who are using
another Internet Service Provider (ISP), the connection settings are disabled.
MSNIA U.S. customers must use the English-U.S. MSN Explorer to change their
connection settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

settings.

1. Sign out of and close your Spanish-U.S. MSN Explorer version.
