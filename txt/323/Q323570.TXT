SYMPTOMS
========

MSN Explorer remains in High Contrast after changing your Appearance Scheme to
the XP Theme or a non-High Contrast scheme through Accessibility Options or
Display under the Control Panel.

CAUSE
=====

Windows XP did not reset a setting stored in the registry that is checked by MSN
Explorer to know if a High Contrast scheme is being used, and thus loads a High
Contrast version of MSN Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close MSN Explorer completely. Make sure the Notification Area (system tray)
contains no MSN Explorer or MSN Messenger icon.

1. Click Start, and then choose Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display (if you do not see the Display icon, on the left pane,
   switch to Classic View).

3. Click the Appearance tab.

4. From the Windows and Buttons: drop-down menu, choose Windows Classic Style.

5. From the Color scheme: drop-down menu, choose Windows Standard.

6. Click Apply.

7. From the Windows and Buttons: drop-down menu, choose Windows XP Style.

8. Click Apply.

9. Close the Control Panel.

10. Restart MSN Explorer.

If MSN Explorer is still in the High Contrast scheme, then it was not closed
completely before initiating the above instructions. Make sure MSN Explorer is
completely closed, and then repeat the resolution procedure described above.
