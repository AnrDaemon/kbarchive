TITLE   :BUG: Issues Related to Using ODBC Driver for DB2 with File DSNs
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following issues have been identified when using the Microsoft ODBC Driver
for DB2 with file data source names (DSNs):

 - An ODBC file DSN that is configured to use the Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2
   does not retain the DSN that is specified when the DSN is created. The Data
   Source Name value is blank when you use the ODBC Data Source Administrator to
   configure the file DSN.

 - The Connect button that is available in the ODBC Driver for DB2
   Authentication dialog box when you configure the file DSN does not try to
   make an ODBC connection to the target database that is specified in the DSN.

CAUSE
=====

 - The ODBC Driver for DB2 does not correctly parse the file DSN path, which
   results in the failure to retain the Data Source Name.

 - The ODBC Driver for DB2 was not designed to try to make an ODBC connection
   when you click Connect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.
