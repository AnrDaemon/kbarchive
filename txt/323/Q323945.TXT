damaged after you download and install third-party Zoo Tycoon content.

==========

To resolve this problem, remove and then reinstall Zoo Tycoon and Dinosaur Digs.
To do so, follow these steps.

documentation to complete these steps.

Part 1: Remove Zoo Tycoon and Dinosaur Digs
-------------------------------------------

Part 2: Restart the Computer by Using a Clean-Boot Procedure
------------------------------------------------------------

Use a clean boot to restart your computer. A clean boot is a way to create a
clean environment. When you start your computer with a clean boot, Microsoft
Windows starts and loads only basic devices and services. For more information
about how to use a clean boot, see the "More Information" section later in this
article.

To restart your computer with a clean boot, follow the steps that are appropriate
to your operating system.

Windows XP:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click
   OK.

3. Click the General tab, and then click Selective Startup.

4. Click to clear the following check boxes under Selective Startup.

   Process SYSTEM.INI file
   Process WIN.INI file
   Load Startup Items

5. Click the Services tab, click to select the "Hide All Microsoft Services"
   check box, and then click Disable All.

6. Click OK, and then click Restart to restart the computer.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click "Normal Startup -
load all device drivers and services" on the General tab in the System
Configuration Utility, click OK, and then click Restart to restart the
computer.

Windows Me:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

3. Click the General tab, and then click "Selective startup".

4. Click to clear all of the check boxes under Selective startup.

5. On the Startup tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box, and then click
   OK.

   When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.


6. After the computer restarts, click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without
   the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

   IMPORTANT: Look closely at the General tab to verify that the check boxes that
   you cleared are still cleared. If you see a selected, unavailable check box
   (it appears dimmed and has a check mark in it), your computer is not truly
   "clean-booted," and you may need assistance from the manufacturer of the
   program that is listed next to the selected, unavailable check box.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click Normal Startup on
the General tab in the System Configuration Utility, click OK, and then restart
the computer.

Windows 98:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
   and then click System Information.

2. On the Tools menu, click System Configuration Utility.

3. Click the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
   following check boxes:

   Process Config.sys file
   Process Autoexec.bat file
   Process Winstart.bat file (if available)
   Process Win.ini file
   Load Startup group items

4. Click OK, and then restart the computer.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click Normal Startup on
the General tab in the System Configuration Utility, click OK, and then restart
the computer.
