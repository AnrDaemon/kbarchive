RESOLUTION
==========

To troubleshoot and resolve this issue, use the following methods, in the order

Method 1
--------

Turn off terrain blending. To do so, follow these steps:

2. In the Map List, click a Zoo Tycoon map (for example, click Basic Grass Map

   Dinosaur Digs map.

3. Click the Game Options button.

4. Click the Sound & Video tab. (This tab is located directly below the File

5. Under Terrain Blending, click Don't Blend, and then click the File Options
   tab.

   zoo.

7. Start a Dinosaur Digs game and test whether the issue is resolved. If this
   procedure resolves the issue, you do not have to follow the remaining steps
   in this article. If the issue is not resolved, go to Method 2.

If you cannot start Zoo Tycoon Dinosaur Digs, you can turn off terrain blending
by editing the Zoo.ini file. To do so, follow these steps:

   Notepad.

2. On the File menu, click Open.

   click=<n>
   normal=<n>
   level=<n>

6. Change the values for each of the following lines that you located in step 5
   to 0. For example:

   drag=0
   click=0
   normal=0
   level=0

7. Click Save on the File menu, and then quit Notepad.
