======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an administrator tries to distribute software by using Systems Management
Server (SMS) 2.0, an administrator can use a defined software installation
account. You can use this account to run a program under a different user's
security context. Programs that target Windows XP clients and use this account
may not work if they contain command line switches or flags.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use SMSCliToknAcct& to make the program run
successfully. This option is defined in the program properties by turning on the
"Run with administrative rights" feature on the Environment tab.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version SMS 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3), SMS 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4).
