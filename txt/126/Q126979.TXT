KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) to migrate users and
groups from a Novell NetWare server to Windows NT, the Migration Tool for
NetWare may fail to migrate some groups. The Error.log file reports the
following error:

   [Adding Users to Groups]
   Could not enumerate users for Group: <Group_Name>

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the group account referenced by the error in the
Error.log file has the same name as a user account on the NetWare server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, rename the group account or the user account on the
NetWare server, and then try the group migration again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0.
