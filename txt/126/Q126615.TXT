BUG# ODBCSDK3: 333 (2.10)

SYMPTOMS
========

If you only install the 16-bit Btrieve/Access/Paradox/Fox/Text/Excel Driver from
the January 1995 Microsoft Developer's Network (MSDN) CD#4 (\ODBC\X86), and you
try to add data source on that driver immediately after it is installed, an
error message will appear:

   The setup routines for the [*** Driver Name ***] ODBC driver could not be
   loaded. You may be low on memory and need to quit a few applications.

CAUSE
=====

In ODBC16.INF, a line that appears only in the dBase Driver Section,

   "Internat" = 1, msjetint.dll,,,, 1994-12-07,  ,, OLDER,  ,,,,,......

should appear in all the desktop database driver sections.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually copy the file MSJETINT.DLL into %SystemRoot%\system\msjetint.dll:

   expand \\CD#4\ODBC\X86\msjetint.dl_ %SystemRoot%\system\msjetint.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC SDK version 2.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
