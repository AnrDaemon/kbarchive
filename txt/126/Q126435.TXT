SYMPTOMS
========

When printing from Automap Road Atlas for Windows, the road symbols on a route
may print as a solid black symbol.

RESOLUTION
==========

Workaround 1
------------

Change the installed Windows video display driver to VGA.

For information about changing your video mode, see your Windows printed
documentation or online Help.

Workaround 2
------------

1. Run Automap Road Atlas.

2. From the File menu, choose Print.

3. Choose Options and select the Use Hatched Brushes box.

Workaround 3
------------

To avoid this problem, install the Dell S3 video driver version 1.3 according to
the manufacturer's instructions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The fault occurs because of a fault within the video driver and not the printer
driver. The Dell S3 version 2.0 drivers can cause the problem to occur. Changing
to the earlier version 1.3 video driver corrects the problem.

The Dell S3 version 2.0 driver causes striping of the text on map printouts if
the Print True Type as Graphics option is enabled. The problem does not occur
with the Dell S3 version 1.3 video driver.

The problem has been corrected in version 3.05 of Automap Road Atlas.
