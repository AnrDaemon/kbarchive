TITLE   :Err Msg: MSMAIL Caused a GP Fault in Module MSSFS.DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Windows for Workgroups to use Novell NetWare (workstation shell
version 3.x and higher) as the primary network, you receive the following error
message in Microsoft Mail when you use the Remember Password option when you
change your password:

   Application Error: MSMAIL caused a General Protection Fault in Module
   MSSFS.DLL at 001A:032D

Your only choice is to close Mail. Note that when this error occurs, your
password is changed but the new password is not cached.

CAUSE
=====

Mail uses the Windows for Workgroups password list file (called
<username>.PWL) to cache the Mail password. When you use Novell NetWare
(workstation shell version 3.x and higer) as the primary network in Windows for
Workgroups, a password list file is neither used nor created. The error occurs
when Mail tries to cache the password but a password list file does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, add the following line to the [Microsoft Mail]
section of the MSMAIL.INI file:

   " Password=<your Mail password> " (without the quotation marks)

Substitute your Mail password for <your Mail password> in the line above.
