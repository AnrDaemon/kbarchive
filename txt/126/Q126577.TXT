SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify the location of the WORKGROUP-DOT-PATH during a workstation
installation of Word for Windows version 6.0 on a Windows for Workgroups version
3.11 system, Systems Management Server overwrites the user-modified entries in
the WINWORD6.INI file.

For example, after you install Word for Windows, your WINWORD6.INI file
contains:

   [Microsoft Word]
   USER-DOT-PATH=C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE
   WORKGROUP-DOT-PATH=<net drive>:\TEMPLATE

where <net drive> is the network drive letter of the shared application.

You modify the WINWORD6.INI file to read:

   [Microsoft Word]
   USER-DOT-PATH=C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE
   WORKGROUP-DOT-PATH=C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE

After you install SMS, the WINWORD6.INI file contains:

   [Microsoft Word]
   USER-DOT-PATH=C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE
   WORKGROUP-DOT-PATH=<net drive>:\TEMPLATE

where <net drive> is the network drive letter of the shared application.
