PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0, and you try to send a
document via version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks (in Word: from the
File menu, choose Send...), the following error may occur:

   An error has occurred while loading the spelling dictionary.

As a result, the message will not be sent.

CAUSE
=====

The spelling lines in the WIN.INI and WINWORD6.INI files do not match. The lines
that must match exactly are the Spelling 1033,0= line in the [Microsoft Word]
section of the WINWORD6.INI and the Spelling (Mail) 1033,0= line in the [MS
Proofing Tools] section of the WIN.INI.

NOTE: This only occurs when a previous version of Microsoft Word has been
installed on your computer; then you upgrade this version to version 6.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the correct setting from the [Microsoft Word] section of the WINWORD6.INI
to the [MS Proofing Tools] section of the WIN.INI.

Example of how to modify the WIN.INI:

Old:

[MS Proofing Tools]
Spelling (Mail) 1033,0=C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSPELL.DLL,
C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSP_AM.LEX

New:

[MS Proofing Tools]
Spelling (Mail)
1033,0=C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSPEL2.DLL,
C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF\MSSP2_EN.LEX

NOTE: The above Spelling lines are one continuous line. They have been wrapped in
this article for display.

Also, you need to make sure the above entries match the ones in the MSMAIL.INI
file. The MSMAIL.INI file should look like the following:

[MS Proofing Tools]
Spelling=Spelling (Mail) 1033,0
