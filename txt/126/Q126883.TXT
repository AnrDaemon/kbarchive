======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to change your Windows password to match your Windows NT Domain
password when you are changing your Windows NT Domain password, you receive one
of the following error messages:

   Unable to change the password for Windows NT because of the following error:
   Access has been denied. For more information, contact your system
   administrator.

   Unable to change the password for Windows NT because of the following error:
   This password cannot be used now.

The Windows password is changed, but the Windows NT Domain password is not
changed.

CAUSE
=====

In the case of the first error message, the Windows 95 password is changed to
match the Windows NT Domain password. Windows NT will be asked to change your
Domain password to an identical password. This should not affect usability. You
should ignore the error message and continue.

In the case of the second error message, you are trying to use a password that is
ineligible because it has previously been used as a Windows NT Domain password
and the conditions set by the Network Administrator restricting the re-use of
this password have not expired. Ignore the error message to continue changing
the Windows 95 password or choose a valid password to also change the Windows NT
Domain password.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change your password, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Passwords icon.

3. Click the Change Windows Password button.

4. Click the Windows NT check box to select it.

5. Click the OK button.

6. Type your old and new passwords in the Change Windows Password dialog box and
