Page 167: Org Chart Colors Unreadable on 16-Color VGA Display
-------------------------------------------------------------

Page 167 shows an organization chart. On a computer with a standard VGA driver
(16 colors) installed, the background of the chart appears as yellow and red
dots, and the text is displayed as unreadable, white blotches.

   NOTE: This problem does not exist on computers running an SVGA driver (256
   colors).

Correction:

The master color scheme in the file LESSON10.PPT should be altered to use only
standard VGA colors.

Comments:

To make Lesson 10 readable, modify the filler color and the text/line color so
that each is a solid color. To make these modifications, follow these steps:

1. In PowerPoint, open LESSON10.PPT.

2. From the View menu, choose Master, and then choose Master Slide.

3. From the Format menu, choose Slide Color Scheme.

   A dialog box showing the currently-assigned colors will appear.

4. Select the Fills color box (third box on top row), choose the Change Color
   button, and choose a solid color. For example, choose Yellow (fifth box on
   top row).

5. After you select the desired color, choose OK to return to the Slide Color
   Scheme dialog box.

6. Select the Text & Lines color box (first box on bottom row) and choose
   the Change Color button.

7. Select the Black bar at the bottom of the Color Selection dialog box, and
   then choose OK.

8. Choose the Apply To All button.

   A readable color scheme is applied to the entire presentation.

9. From the View menu, choose Slides.

Save your file with the changes as LESSON10.PPT. Now you can complete lesson 10
as described in the book.
