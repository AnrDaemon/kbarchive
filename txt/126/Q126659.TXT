TITLE   :PC WRmt: Err Msg: Account Not Valid User of Message File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Mail System Selector program to choose Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks (MSMAIL) after you selected Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows,
you may get the following error:

   Account not valid user of message file

As a result, you will not be able to log in to Mail.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs if the following entries are in any of the MSMAIL.INI files:

   [Providers]
   Name= PABNSP MSSFS FAXSTUB
   Transport=FAXSTUB
   Logon=FAXSTUB

NOTE: For Mail for PC Networks, the section should read:

   [Providers]
   Name= PABNSP MSSFS
   Transport= MSSFS
   Logon= MSSFS

RESOLUTION
==========

If you delete any reference to FAXSTUB in the MSMAIL.INI files and any instance
of the file in the WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSMAIL and the WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT
directories, you will be able to log into Mail.

Microsoft does not support using Microsoft At Work Fax, which ships with Windows
for Workgroups version 3.11, with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the Selector program to change between MSMAIL and the Remote Mail
clients, the program will read the MSMAIL.INI and look for files in the MSRMT
and the MSMAIL directories under the WINDOWS directory. If any reference is made
to the FAXSTUB.DLL in the NAME= line in the MSMAIL.INI, you will get the above
error message.

When you install Windows for Workgroups and the At-Work Fax, the FAXSTUB.DLL and
FAXOPT.DLL files (from Windows for Workgroups) and the MSSFS.DLL file (from
version 3.2 of Mail for PC Networks) will be loaded. The MSSFS.DLL is the Mail
for PC Networks Shared File System transport file. The latest version of this
file is 266,848 bytes in size and dated 2\24\95.

For more information, please see the "Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit" pages
6-82.
