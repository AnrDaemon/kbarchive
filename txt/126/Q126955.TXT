TITLE   :PRB: Where to Put EXTERNAL ARRAY in a Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build a PROJECT or APPLICATION in Visual FoxPro, you may get a warning
box that says 'Unable to find unknown <array name>.'

CAUSE
=====

One cause of this error is an array being used in a screen or other program.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is only a compile time warning and will not prevent your application from
building or executing correctly.

To prevent this warning from appearing In Visual FoxPro, put the EXTERNAL ARRAY
command in the Load Event of the Form or FORMSET with a #REGION 1 before
anything else, as in this example:

      #REGION 1
      EXTERNAL ARRAY <array name>

This prevents the warning and allows you to continue building the application.

NOTE: Make sure you issue a READ EVENTS command after the DO FORM command or you
will get the error "Variable not found" when executing the form.

Additional query words: VFoxWin 3.00
