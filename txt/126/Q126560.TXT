TITLE   :Cannot Create NetBIOS Session Over TCP/IP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run NET VIEW or NET USE, you may receive the following error message:

   System error 1225 has occurred. The remote system refused the network
   connection.

A trace of network activity shows repeated pairs of the following messages:

   workstation->server: SYN
   server->workstation: ACK, RST

The following STOP message may also appear:

   STOP 0xc000000A

This problem occurs on servers with very heavy NetBIOS traffic over TCP/IP.

CAUSE
=====

When netbt receives a zero length message, it fails to update the number of
bytes left in the transport. As a result, when the connection is later
disconnected, it never receives disconnect indication from the transport,
leaving the connection unusable. After all connections are exhausted, new
connections are not accepted.

STATUS
======

NETBT.SYS has been modified so that it correctly handles 0 length messages.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
