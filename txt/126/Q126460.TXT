SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot connect to a NetWare Remote Network (NRN) server with Dial-Up
Networking. The modem usually drops the connection while you are entering your
user name and password.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the NRN server's inability to recognize compression or
error correction by the modem.

RESOLUTION

features. To turn these features off, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Modems icon.

3. Click your modem and then click the Properties button.

4. Click the Connection tab.

5. Click the Advanced button.

6. Click the Use Error Control check box to clear it. (NOTE: If this check box
   is unavailable, your modem does not support these features.)
