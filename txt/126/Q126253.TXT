PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Scenes (all collections), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error is generated when you use the Scenes 1.0 After Dark module
with After Dark 3.0:

   Application Error
   ADW30 caused a General Protection Fault in Module ADW30.EXE at XXXX:XXXX.

The error occurs when the "Preparing to change pictures..." status bar gets to
100 percent.

CAUSE
=====

The GP fault occurs because the Scenes 1.0 After Dark module was designed for
use with After Dark 2.0. Berkeley Systems made some slight changes in the After
Dark engine with the release of After Dark 3.0. This caused some compatibility
problems with modules designed for After Dark 2.0. Berkeley Systems is aware of
the problem between After Dark 3.0 and Scenes 1.0, but does not plan to make any
changes to After Dark 3.0 to support Scenes 1.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

A possible workaround to view Scenes 1.0 images using After Dark 3.0 is to use
the After Dark SlideShow module. The SlideShow module can display the Scenes 1.0
JPEG (JPG) files as well as any BMP (including RLE), TARGA, PCX and GIF files.
