On your SNA Server, an attempted connection is not able to activate and holds in

   Description: Node ID from remote computer was rejected.

   Event ID: 55
   Description: No incoming connection matched info on XID from remote
   MAC address <MAC address>.

From the SNA Server client, when you attempt to connect using a 5250 emulator the
following error message appears:

   There is a problem with the configuration of the connection to the
   AS/400

   Primary return code = 0003
   Secondary return code = 00000005

One of the three following conditions exist:

 - The Network Name in the Connection Properties or the Server properties does
   not match the Local Network ID in the Network attributes screen on the
   AS/400.

 - The Remote Control Point Name in the Connection Properties does not match the
   Local Control Point name defined in the AS/400 Network Attribute Screen.

 - The Remote Node ID in the Connection properties is filled in. It should be
   blank.
