======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Options on the Project menu, the Encrypted check box is selected
even though it was never selected.

CAUSE
=====

You have included in your project, as an excluded object, an application (.app
file) that was built with encryption.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to work around this problem:

 - If you want to include a reference to another application in your project,
   and that project was built with encryption, rebuild the referenced project
   without encryption.

 - Remove the referenced application from your project. Then, on the Project
   menu, click Options, and make sure that you clear the Encryption check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create two projects named ProjectA and ProjectB.

2. Build ProjectB with encryption turned on.

3. In ProjectA, click Add, and add a reference to the ProjectB application file.

4. The resultant A.APP file is built with encryption turned on. To check this,
   on the Project menu, click Options; the Encryption check box is selected.
