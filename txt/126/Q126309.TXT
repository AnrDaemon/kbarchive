SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0 differ from Windows NT 3.1 in that an
administrative shares are no longer automatically created for CD-ROM drives and
floppy drives.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrative shares were originally intended for backup purposes. Each
administrative share is periodically polled by the server for the amount of free
disk space on the volume so that the administrator can be warned if the disk is
nearing its capacity.

Because issues do not apply to CD-ROM or floppy drives, an administrative share
is no longer created for these devices.

Additional query words: prodnt cdrom admin share
