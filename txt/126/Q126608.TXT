TITLE   :Uni to Multiprocessor Utility Fails to Update System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Uni to Multiprocessor upgrade utility (UPTOMP.EXE) for Windows NT may fail
and display the following error message:

   Processor Upgrade Utility - Error

   Your system has not been upgraded because the utility was unable to save the
   xxxxxxxx system files. Check the files in the system32 directory and the
   "save" directory, delete the "save" directory if necessary then re-run this
   utility.

where xxxxxxxx represents the currently installed system files (uniprocessor or
multiprocessor).

CAUSE
=====

The error message above appears when there is a %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\UPTOMP.OLD
directory. UPTOMP.EXE copies the currently installed HAL.DLL, KERNEL32.DLL,
NTDLL.DLL, NTOSKRNL.EXE, and WINSRV.DLL files to the UPTOMP.OLD directory before
installing the new versions of the files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete or rename the UPTOMP.OLD directory and
re-run UPTOMP.EXE.
