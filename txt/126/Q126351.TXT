TITLE   :Different Language Site Reporting Not Supported in SMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot report from one site to another using different language versions of
Systems Management Server version 1.0. For example, a German SMS site cannot
report to a parent French SMS site.

CAUSE
=====

Language strings are localized and cannot be accurately converted by the
receiving site. Converting the language strings (used in packages, comments,
events, etc.) requires single-byte to multi-byte conversion.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, configure the site hierarchies as follows:

1. Use the same language version of SMS.

2. Configure the code-page and country settings to appropriate languages.

NOTE: In this situation, all needed event codes, error codes, etc., required by
the system, are presented in a consistent way without any conversion.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
