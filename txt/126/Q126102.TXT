-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using either the VGA or SVGA display driver and make the following
changes in Paintbrush, you receive a

   general protection (GP) fault

error message in Paintbrush:

 - Change the Units option in the Image Attributes dialog box to Pels.

 - Set the Height setting to 833 and the Width setting to a value between 929
   and 944 in the Image Attributes dialog box.

Once you have made these changes you cannot restart Paintbrush.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two ways to work around this problem.

Method 1
--------

Set the Height and Width values so they do not match the values listed above. If
you cannot start Paintbrush to make these changes, use any text editor (such as
Notepad) to edit the [Paintbrush] section of the WIN.INI file. Change the
"width=" and "height=" lines to values that do not match those listed above, and
then save and close the WIN.INI file. For example, you could use the following
settings in the WIN.INI file:

   [Paintbrush]
   width=928
   height=833

Method 2
--------

You may be able to work around this problem by using a display driver other than
the VGA or SVGA display driver.
