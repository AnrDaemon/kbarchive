The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MAPI function MAPIDeleteMail allows you to delete a Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks mail message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When this function is called and completed successfully, it does not place the
message in the Wastebasket or deleted mail folder. Instead, MAPIDeleteMail frees
the pointer to the message, subsequently making the mail message irretrievable.

This is contrary to Microsoft Mail for Windows user interface that deletes a mail
message and moves it from the current folder to the Wastebasket or deleted mail
folder. However, if the current folder is the Wastebasket or deleted mail
folder, Mail for Windows deletes the mail message and frees the pointer to that
message, leaving it irretrievable.
