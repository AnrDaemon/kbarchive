SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to reinstall the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500
series version 3.0 or 3.1 printer driver after you have installed the version
4.0, 4.1, or 5.0 driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install the HP DeskJet 500 series version 4.0 or higher printer driver,
the HPSETUP program enters a line of code in the [spooler] section of the
WIN.INI file. You must remove this line in order for an older version of the
printer driver to work correctly. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to
remove the following line from the [spooler] section of the WIN.INI file before
you reinstall the older version of the printer driver.

If you are using an HP DeskJet 540 printer, remove this line:

      qp.LPT1=hpvvin.dll

If you are using any other HP DeskJet printer, remove this line:

      qp.LPT1=hpviod.dll

To install the older HP DeskJet printer driver, follow these steps:

1. In Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

2. Insert the HP DeskJet Series Printer Driver Installation disk in the
   appropriate disk drive and then type

   <drive>:\hpsetup

   in the Command Line box, where <drive> is the drive letter of the floppy
   drive containing the installation disk. For example, if the installation disk
   is in drive A, type:

   a:\hpsetup

3. When you are prompted as to whether you want to continue installing over a
   previous version of the driver, choose Yes.

4. When the installation is finished, quit and then restart Windows.
