SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print from any Windows-based application, you receive the
following error message:

   File Error: Cannot find TOR.DRV
   Not enough memory to print, quit one or more applications to increase
   available memory and try again.

You may also receive this error message when you start Paintbrush.

Or, you receive the following error message when you start Write:

   Application Error: WRITE Caused a General Protection Fault in Module
   KRNL386.EXE

Or, when you select the IBM 4039 Print Accelerator from the list of installed
printers in the Print Setup dialog box, you receive the following error
message:

   IBM4039-10R Print Accelerator driver TOR is not found. Please reinstall
   through Control Panel or choose another printer.

CAUSE
=====

These problems can occur after you install the IBM 4039 Print Accelerator
printer driver version 02.12.93 and set it as the default printer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, select another printer as the default printer in the
Print Setup dialog box. To install the Generic/Text Only printer driver and
select it as the default printer, follow these steps:

1. Double-click the Control Panel icon in the Main program group.

2. Double-click the Printers icon.

3. Choose the Add button.

4. In the List Of Printers box, select Generic/Text Only, and then choose the
   Install button.

5. In the Installed Printers box, select Generic/Text Only.

6. Choose the Set As Default Printer button.

Note that when you use the Generic/Text Only printer, you can print only text.
You cannot print TrueType fonts and you may lose some of the formatting in
documents. Using the Generic/Text Only printer is a temporary workaround only
until you can obtain the correct printer driver from the printer's
manufacturer.
