TITLE   :WINS: Push Notification Sent on Every Registration
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the value for Update Count in the Push Partner Properties dialog box to
any value causes PUSH notifications (triggers) to be sent to PULL partners after
every single name registration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When two WINS servers are configured in a PUSH/PULL relationship, the Push
Partner Update Count determines how many additions and updates made to the WINS
database result in changes that need to be replicated to the PULL partner. When
the number of additions and changes equals the value defined by Update Count
then a PUSH (trigger) is sent to the PULL partner, which then requests
replicas.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
