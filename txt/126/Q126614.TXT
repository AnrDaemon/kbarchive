SYMPTOMS
========

If you use SQLBindParameter to directly pass more than 32K of data to a SQL
statement against 16-bit desktop database drivers, you will get the following
error message:

   SQL_ERROR: Memory allocation failure.

The following is a piece of the code to duplicate the error:

      //data source is an access table objtab with only one OLE field.
      //16-bit Access driver 2.00.2317 is used

      SQLPrepare(hstmt, "insert into objtab(?)", SQL_NTS);
      BigObj = AllocateMemory(sizeof(UCHAR) * 32800);
      cbBigObj = 32800;
      SQLBindParameter(
         hstmt, 1, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_BINARY, SQL_C_LONGVARCHAR,
         32800, 0, BigObj, 32800, &cbBigObj);
      //Prepare the BigObj
      SQLExecute(hstmt);

Returns:

   SQL Error State:S1001; Native Error Code: 34;
   ODBC Error:[Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 2.0 Driver]memory allocation
   failure.

NOTE: If cbBigObj is changed to 32750 (with corresponding changes in
SQLBindParameter), SQLExecute will succeed.

CAUSE
=====

The internal buffer for direct parameters passed to the 16-bit desktop database
drivers is limited to 32K.

NOTE: You will actually have a little less than 32K of total parameters, because
some space is taken up by a length byte in the internal buffer.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Use 32-bit drivers if you can.

 - Use SQLPutData to send it in installments. Using direct parameters is not
   recommended to pass in large data. Instead, you can use data-at-execution
   with SQLPutData.

 - Use SQLExtendedFetch and SQLSetPos...SQL_ADD, which is faster. Because all of
   the parameters are not copied into a separate buffer before being passed into
   the internal buffer, you save a memcopy.
