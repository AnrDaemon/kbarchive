TITLE   :PC DOS: 3.x DOS Client Displays Garbage in Address List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.x of the Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation may show garbage in
the address list. When you select an address list with more than 32,768
addresses from the MS-DOS client, and select a letter (such as z, where the
first address beginning with the letter z is past the 32768th address), the
address list will not move to the z addresses.

If you press a key, such as the down arrow, garbage will begin to appear in the
address list. You can back out by pressing the ESCAPE key (ESC). This problem
does not occur if you select to go to the end of the list by pressing the END
key.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most .USR files in the mail system database will not grow past:

   (500 addresses/PO)*(53 bytes/address)=26500 bytes

This calculation is based on that Microsoft Mail postoffices are limited to a
maximum of 500 local users and that the record size of a .USR file is 53
bytes/record. It is possible to have .USR files that are larger than this
because the .USR file may also contain local groups for that postoffice.
However, SNADS and PROFS gateways also use .USR files; thus, larger USR files
may exist.
