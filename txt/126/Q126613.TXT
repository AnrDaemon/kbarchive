BUG# QJET: 1870 (2.00.2317)

SYMPTOMS
========

After using SQLSetConnectOption to set SQL_CURRENT_QUALIFIER to a valid data
source path, the following SQLConnect (or SQLDriverConnect) will return
SQLSetConnectOption failure message, and a connection is established without
current qualifier set to that desired path.

NOTE: It occurs with all the desktop database drivers.

For example, in case of Microsoft Access driver, do the following:

      SQLAllocConnect(henv, &hdbc);
      SQLSetConnectOption(
         hdbc, SQL_CURRENT_QUALIFIER, "C:\ODBC20\SMPLDATA\ACCESS\SAMPLE"
      );  //Note: It's a valid path
      SQLConnect(
         hdbc, "sdk21-Access", SQL_NTS, "admin", SQL_NTS, NULL, 0
      );  //Note: DSN points to "C:\ODBCSDK\SMPLDATA\ACCESS\SAMPLE"

You will get:

   SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, IM006, "[Microsoft][ODBC DLL] Driver's
   SQLSetConnectOption failed" 08003, "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver pack 2.0
   Driver]Connection is not open"

The 08003 is misleading. Actually, the connection to sdk21-Access has been
established with the current qualifier set to

   C:\ODBCSDK\SMPLDATA\ACCESS\SAMPLE.

WORKAROUND
==========

Invoke SQLSetConnectOption to set SQL_CURRENT_QUALIFIER after the connection has
been established, (that is, SQLConnect or SQLDriverConnect has succeeded).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC DeskTop Database Drivers
Pack version 2.00.2317. We are researching this problem and will post new
