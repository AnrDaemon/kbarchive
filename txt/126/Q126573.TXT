-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Windows NT has an option that lets you connect to a network
resource as someone else. This option uses a Connect As box in the Connect
Network Drive dialog box.

Microsoft Windows 95 does not have such an option in its Map Network Drive
dialog box. The only way to connect to a network resource as someone else
in Windows 95 is to log off and then log back on as a different user.


Additional query words: login logout logon logoff
