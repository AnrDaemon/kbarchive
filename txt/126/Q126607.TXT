TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Load MFCCLSWZ.DLL with ODBC SDK Version 2.1
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) version 2.1 Software Development Kit
(SDK) from the January Microsoft Developer's Network (MSDN) Level 2 CD is
installed on a system that already has Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.1
installed and you attempt to run Visual C++ components, it fails with the
following message:

   MFCCLSWZ.DLL This required file cannot be loaded. Please reinstall the
   Microsoft Visual C++ development environment.

CAUSE
=====

The ODBC 2.1 SDK Setup from the January MSDN Level 2 CD replaces the Visual C++
version of the files MSVCRT20.DLL and CTL3D32.DLL with older versions. The
problem does not occur with any other versions of the ODBC 2.1 SDK.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either reinstall Visual C++ 2.1, or copy the files MSVCRT20.DLL and CTL3D32.DLLl
from the Visual C++ CD to the ODBCSDK\REDIST32 and WINNT\SYSTEM32 directories.

Additional query words: Windows NT setup install
