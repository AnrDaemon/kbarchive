======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The OtherServers option on SNA Server clients gives the client access to LUs
through SNA Servers that are outside of the client's primary SNA Server domain.
The number of servers that can be listed in the OtherServers parameter depends
on the client's computer platform as follows:

Platform     Maximum Number of Servers in OtherServers
----------   -----------------------------------------
Windows NT   No limit
Windows 95   16
Win3.x:      15 (or 256/<length of server name>)
MS-DOS:      8

MORE INFORMATION
================

The number of servers in the local domain may limit the number of OtherServers
you can actually use. Local servers are added to the service table before
OtherServers. The service table has 32 entries in Win3.x, 16 in DOS, 1024 in
Windows 95 and 1024 in Windows NT. The sponsor naps and the local nap reserve
one entry in the service table. Also, if any invokable APPC transaction programs
(TP) are configured on an SNA Server client, each local TP reserves one service
table entry.

For additional information, refer to page 207, Appendix C, of the Microsoft SNA
Server Reference Guide.
