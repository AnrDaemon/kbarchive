Although Windows NT does not include a RAM disk device driver, there are several
drivers available from third-party vendors and as shareware or freeware. These
drivers can be obtained by searching the internet for "RAM DISK" and "NT."

MORE INFORMATION
================

A RAM disk is used to create an area in your system's extended memory to
simulate a hard disk drive. The main benefit of a RAM disk is speed. RAM disk
access is much faster than hard disk access since the RAM disk is always loaded
into memory. Memory allocated to a RAM disk cannot be used for other purposes,
and data stored on a RAM disk is lost when you shutdown your computer.

Microsoft included a sample RAM disk with the Windows NT 3.1 version of the
Microsoft Win32 DDK. This sample RAM disk was intended for educational purposes
only, and is not supported by Microsoft on any version of Windows NT.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
