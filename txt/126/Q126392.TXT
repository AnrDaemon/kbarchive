======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server registers itself with the Banyan Vines Directory Services when the
SNABASE service is started. This is necessary for SNA Server clients that are
communicating over the Banyan Vines redirector to connect to SNA Server. If the
StreetTalk username is the same as the SNA Server machine name, the Vines
StreetTalk server rejects a request from SNA Server to create its PC-based
service.

CAUSE
=====

When SNABASE service starts up, it attempts to create a PC-based service with
its local StreetTalk Server using the StreetTalk Group name (for example,
CNS@Microsoft).

The PC-based service name that SNA Server submits to the Vines StreetTalk server
is a combination of the SNA Server computername along with the StreetTalk group
name. For example, if the computername is Godzilla, then Godzilla@CNS@Microsoft
is the PC-based service submitted by SNA Server.

If there is a StreetTalk username with Godzilla@CNS@Microsoft, then the Banyan
Vines server rejects the request (return code 1013) to create a PC- based
service.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the SNA Server computername or delete the
user record from the Vines StreetTalk server. You can do this using the Vines
Manage program.

Additional query words: prodsna Banyan Vines computer user name
