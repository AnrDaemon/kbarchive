TITLE   :Err Msg: "Not Enough Server Storage is Available to Process..."
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While running Windows NT, the following error message appears:

   Not enough server storage is available to process this command.

CAUSE
=====

This indicates that Windows NT does not have enough paged pool memory available
to process a command. This can happen when the PagedPoolSize is either set too
small or when an application does not re-allocate memory correctly.

Insufficient PagedPoolSize may be due to the fact that the INITIAL.INF file that
shipped with Windows NT contains the following lines:

Ifstr(i) $(STF_PRODUCT) == "LanmanNT"
Ifstr(i) $(!STF_DOMAIN_ROLE) == "DC"

   Debug-Output "SETUP.INF: AddPdcMachineAccount for PDC of new domain..."
   LibraryProcedure STATUS, $(!LIBHANDLE),
   AddPdcMachineAccount $(!STF_COMPUTERNAME)
   Debug-Output "SETUP.INF: AddPdcMachineAccount returned: "$(STATUS)

Endif
shell "REGISTRY.INF" MakeQuotaEntries 48 24 Endif

The call to REGISTRY.INF only happens for Windows NT servers, not workstations.
The parameters passed to REGISTRY.INF are PagedPoolSize (48) and
RegistrySizeLimit (24). The PagedPoolSize value over-rides the value calculated
at bootup based on physical memory. The algorithm for calculating PagedPoolSize
at bootup produces values approximating the physical memory size of the computer
up to a maximum of 192 megabytes.

For additional information on this algorithm, please see the following article(s)
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q126402: PagedPoolSize and NonPagedPoolSize Values in Windows NT 3.5

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem can be worked around by using the registry editor to zero out the
PagedPoolSize parameter.

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

The page pooled memory management parameters are located in:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
     \SYSTEM
       \CurrentControlSet
         \Control
           \Session Manager
             \Memory Management

If the error is due to an application not re-allocating memory correctly, normal
troubleshooting using tools such as Performance Monitor, or PMON.EXE (from the
Windows NT Resource Kit) should be employed to isolate the problem component.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Advanced Server
version 3.1 and Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem was corrected in
Windows NT version 3.51.
