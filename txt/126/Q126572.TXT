PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MS-DOS DELTREE command does not remove directories named DIR000<x>
where x is an integer number. For example, the DELTREE command does not remove a
directory called DIR0001.

WORKAROUND
==========

You must use a third-party disk utility to remove DIR000<x> directories.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft ScanDisk creates DIR000<x> directories when it finds directory
structures that are damaged beyond repair. All the files in these directories
have read-only and hidden attributes. The MS-DOS ATTRIB command does not change
the attributes on these files.

Additional query words: 6.22 scandisk.exe
