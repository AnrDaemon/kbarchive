allows the developer to set the MAPI_LOGON_UI flag that will bring up the user
interface to logon to a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice. The interface
allows the user to select OK or Cancel. If the user selects the Cancel button,
MAPILogon does not return an error code 1 (MAPI_USER_ABORT); instead, it returns
an error code 3 (MAPI_LOGIN_FAILURE).
