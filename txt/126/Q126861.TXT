======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to an existing Post Office in Windows for Workgroups
Mail, you receive the following error message:

   The network path you entered could not be found

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if you do not have an available network drive letter for
Mail to use to connect to the Post Office. When this occurs, Mail tries to
connect to the Post Office using network drive M. If that drive letter is not
available, Mail tries to use the next available drive letter before drive M. If
no other drive letters are available, Mail returns the error message stated
above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Adjust the LASTDRIVE= statement in the CONFIG.SYS file to reflect the last
possible drive letter. For example, add the following line to the CONFIG.SYS
file if it does not already exist:

   LASTDRIVE=Z

NOTE: You can use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the CONFIG.SYS file.
After you edit the file, save and then close it and then restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some network DOS requesters, such as Novell NetWare's NETX.EXE, require the
LASTDRIVE statement to be set to a letter other than Z. Changing the value of
the LASTDRIVE statement in these configurations can limit network functionality.
If you cannot change the LASTDRIVE statement, disconnect some of your network
drives to provide available drive letters.
