SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Turtle Beach Monte Carlo sound card, you may experience partial
sound or no sound in a variety of Windows applications. However, wave (.wav)
sounds will play correctly from Media Player.

Pronunciations in Bookshelf and Encarta may play correctly the first time;
however, subsequent attempts to play sound may fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Monte Carlo Standard drivers and not the V-synth driver. For additional
information about using the Monte Carlo or Turtle Beach drivers, consult the
documentation from the hardware provider.


MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Monte Carlo Setup program loads the V-synth driver shipped by
Monte Carlo. This driver gives improved MIDI playback, but may cause problems
when using Digital Audio (wave) intensive applications.

For more information, contact Turtle Beach technical support at (510) 624-6200.
