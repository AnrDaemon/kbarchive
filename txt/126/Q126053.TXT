KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOM
-------

The Resource Kit Tools for Microsoft Windows NT Help file (RKTOOLS.HLP)
lists a tool called "NTDETECT.COM: Startup Hardware Detector" in the Setup
and Troubleshooting Tools section. When you choose it to find more
information, the following two statements are displayed:

 - At the command prompt, switch to the \RESKIT directory where the Resource
   Guide utilities are installed, and type INSTALLD.

 - Files required for NTDetect:

   INSTALLD.CMD
   NTDETECT.COM

The two files, INSTALLD.CMD and NTDETECT.COM, do not exist in the RESKIT
directory. They also do not exist in the source compact disc or disks of
the Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 Resource
Kit. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
