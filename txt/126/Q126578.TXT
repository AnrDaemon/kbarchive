SYMPTOMS
========

After you add or remove physical memory and restart your EISA bus computer, the
correct amount of memory is detected. However, NTDETECT does not detect the
correct amount of memory.

CAUSE
=====

NTDETECT reads the EISA data as created by the EISA configuration utility. This
problem occurs if you do not run the EISA configuration utility to update the
memory information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, run the EISA configuration utility provided by the
computer manufacturer to update the total memory information.
