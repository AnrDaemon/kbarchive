Even though your user account is a member of the Users group, when you attempt
to paste the contents of the Clipboard into a ClipBook Viewer page the following
error message appears:

this procedure fails unless your user account is a member of the Administrators,
Server Operators, or Power Users groups.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add your user account to the local Power Users, Server Operators, or
Administrators group.

STATUS
======

as it becomes available.
