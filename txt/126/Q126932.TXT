SYMPTOMS
========

The following error is generated when you close Windows NT with Scenes 2.0
running:

   Microsoft Scenes

   This Windows application cannot respond to the End Task request. It may be
   busy, waiting for a response from you, or it may have stopped executing.

   Wait     End Task     Cancel

   - Press Cancel to cancel and return to Windows NT.

   - Press End Task to close this application immediately. You will lose any
   unsaved information in this application.

   - Press Wait to give the application 20 seconds to finish what it is doing and
   then try to close the application again.

Attempting to close Windows NT with Scenes 2.0 running causes Windows NT to pause
for approximately 10 seconds before the above error is displayed. The error
message is displayed for approximately five seconds before Windows NT closes
Scenes 2.0 and continues with its closing process.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only known resolution is to exit Scenes 2.0 before closing Windows NT.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Scenes 2.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
