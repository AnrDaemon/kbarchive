TITLE   :Windows NT Client Loses Session To Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1; winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.5 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you close an SNA Server 5250 (or APPC) session on a Windows NT 3.5
computer, any other SNA applications with a connection to the server lose their
session. As a result:

 - If SNA Admin is also running on the same machine, and the 5250 session is
   disconnected. SNA Admin may also lose its connection to SNA Server, causing
   an SNA Server Admin Error.

   NOTE: 5250 emulators also use the SNA Server APPC interface.

 - The Windows NT system event log includes the following error (for each time
   the user disconnected their 5250 session), if TCP/IP is being used:

   Event: 2012
   Source: Srv
   Description: The server has encountered a network error.

 - Within an internal SNA Server client trace, the named pipe session fails with
   rc=59 (An unexpected network error occurred).

 - Any other APPC applications with sessions against the same SNA Server receive
   the following error:

   primary return code = F003 = AP_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_ABENDED

   This error returned by SNA Server when its client-server LAN session is lost.

CAUSE
=====

If a Windows NT process has a pending write request on a named pipe and then
calls ExitProcess() before the write completes, all other applications connected
to the same server pipe fail with error 59 (unexpected pipe close).
