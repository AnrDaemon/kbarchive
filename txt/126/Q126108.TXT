======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Shared Program Manager group (.GRP) files become damaged.

CAUSE
=====

Sharing Program Manager group files is not supported for the following reasons:

 - When it is writing to .GRP files, Program Manager does not take file
   attributes into account.

 - Program Manager copies icons from their source, renders them at the correct
   color depth for the video driver, and saves them in the .GRP file. If
   different computers sharing the same .GRP files use different video drivers,
   the .GRP files become damaged.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use a logon script to copy the .GRP files to each
user's Windows directory.
