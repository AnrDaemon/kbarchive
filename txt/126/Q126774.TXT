The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you modify a Creative Writer or Fine Artist sticker on a system running
Microsoft Windows 3.x, all the colors that were part of the original sticker
change to black when you do the following:

1. Double-click a sticker to place it on the crayon easel to edit it.

2. Copy and paste it into Paintbrush and edit the sticker.

3. Paste the sticker back into Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

This is due to the way Paintbrush remaps the color palette when you modify
pictures. You can copy stickers to Paintbrush, but it is not possible to copy
them back into Creative Writer or Fine Artist after editing them without the
original sticker colors turning black.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem does not occur in Microsoft Windows 95.
