KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start Microsoft Windows 95 you receive the following error
message:

   Not enough extended memory available to run Windows.

   Quit one or more applications to increase available memory or restart your
   computer. Press any key to continue...

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if you have configured your computer to create a
RAM drive larger than 15 megabytes (MB). The error occurs even if your computer
has enough memory to create the RAM drive and still meet the memory requirements
for starting Windows 95.

A RAM drive larger than 15 MB is allocated all the available extended memory
below physical address 16 MB. To start Windows 95 on most computers, some memory
below 16 MB is necessary for DMA buffers. If all the memory below 16 MB is
allocated to the RAM drive, Windows 95 cannot start.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, decrease the size of the RAM drive to less than 15 MB.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key and then choose Command Prompt Only.

2. At the command prompt, type

   " edit c:\config.sys " (without the quotation marks)

   and then press ENTER.

3. Locate the line that contains RAMDRIVE.SYS. Change the line so that it
   contains a value lower than 15 MB. For example, to use an 8 MB RAM drive,
   change the line to read:

   " DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\RAMDRIVE.SYS 8192 " (without the quotation marks)

4. Save the CONFIG.SYS file and then quit the editor.

5. Restart your computer.
