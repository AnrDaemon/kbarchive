TITLE   :Err Msg: ERROR 3649: The IFSHLP.SYS Driver Is Not Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the command NET START NETBEUI you receive the following error
message:

   ERROR 3649: To load NetBEUI, the NDISHLP.SYS driver must be listed in the
   [Network Drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - The IFSHLP.SYS driver is not being loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file and you are
   trying to run the NET START NETBEUI command.

 - The "Transport=" line is missing the NDISHLP.SYS driver entry in the [Network
   Drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the NDISHLP.SYS driver is listed in the "Transport=" line in the
   [Network Drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

2. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file with any text editor (such as Notepad). If it does
   not already exist, place the line "device=c:\<windows>\ifshlp.sys"
   (without the quotation marks) at the end of the file. Substitute the name of
   your Windows directory for <windows> in the line above. Save and then
   close the CONFIG.SYS file, quit Windows, and restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IFSHLP.SYS driver is not automatically added in the CONFIG.SYS file when you
are using multiple configurations.
