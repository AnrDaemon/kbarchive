TITLE   :SMS Hierarchy Manager Fails Due to Stack Overflow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbHMan smshierman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SMS Hierarchy Manager process terminates unexpectedly due to a stack
overflow. If you attempt to manually start the SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER service
from Services in Control Panel, the following error appears:

   Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly.

In addition, a Dr. Watson error log is generated which indicates a stack overflow
occurred in the PREINST.EXE module.

CAUSE
=====

You may have inadvertently implemented a Systems Management Server version 1.0
hierarchy which contains a circular path. For example, Site A reports to Site B,
Site B reports to Site C, and Site C reports to Site A.


RESOLUTION
----------

To correct this problem, use an SQL query of the Sites table to reveal the
current parent assignments. Correct the tree from the bottom up using the
PREINST /DELSITE command. You can also correct the tree manually from the Sites
table. For complex hierarchies, determining the location of the circular
reference can be difficult.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
