SUMMARY
=======

If you are using a floptical disk drive with Windows 95, you should note the
following items:

 - In Windows 95, floptical disk drives are supported only by real-mode ASPI
   drivers.

 - Floptical disk drives controlled by the BIOS are not supported.

 - You must format floptical disks from an MS-DOS command prompt using a
   vendor-supplied formatting tool (such as C Format or EZSCSI). Windows 95 will
   recognize only partitioned media.
