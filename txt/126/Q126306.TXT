The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

According to Laser Tools Technical Support, the Laser Tools PrintCache program
causes certain versions of Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) to stop responding (hang)
when you choose to view network information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following versions of MSD hang when you choose to view network information
if PrintCache (PCACHE.EXE) is loaded as a terminate-and-stay- resident (TSR)
program:

 - MSD version 2.10 (included with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version
   3.11)

 - MSD version 2.11 (included with MS-DOS versions 6.21 and 6.22)

This problem with PCACHE.EXE does not occur with earlier versions of MSD (2.00
and 2.01).

Workarounds
-----------

Use either of the following methods to work around this problem:

 - Start MSD with the /I switch to skip hardware detection. Do not choose to
   view network information.

 - Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and remove or remark the PCACHE.EXE line.

PrintCache is manufactured by Laser Tools, a manufacturer independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
