TITLE   :PC Rmt: Using Null Modem Script at Higher Baud Rates Than 9600
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The null modem script is written to transfer data at a default maximum of 9600
Baud. To increase the data transfer speed to 19200 baud:

1. Modify the NULLMODM.MDM script according to the instructions located in the
   Microsoft Mail version 3.2 "Administrator's Guide" on page 378 "Modifying a
   Script File."

2. Add the following line to the INITIALIZE: section of the script before the
   return 0 line:

   " BAUD 19200" (without the quotation marks)

3. Save and compile the script.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below is an example of a modified INITIALIZE: section:

INITIALIZE:

   title "Null Modem"
   BAUD 19200
   return 0

You should only modify the script. Do not modify the speed setting within
Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS. You should keep it at 9600 baud. To verify the
setting, from the Mail menu, select Communications. The Baud Rate should be set
at 9600.

In addition, the serial port settings in the Mail postoffice (PO) should also be
set to 9600 baud. To verify this, start the Mail Administration program
(ADMIN.EXE), from the Config menu, select Serial. This will list the current
Baud Rate setting.

When the MS-DOS Remote client is finished and disconnects from External, it will
display the Closing Connection message, but it may not accept another null modem
connection from the Remote client. If it does not, you must exit from External
and restart it.
