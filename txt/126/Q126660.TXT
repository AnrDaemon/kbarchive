TITLE   :PC Win: Images Pasted into a Mail Message Are Blank
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an image is cut from another application and pasted into a Mail message, it
may not be visible to the recipients. When the recipient reads the message, the
space where the image should be will be blank. If the recipient double-clicks
the blank space, the following error message appears:

   Pictures and bitmaps cannot be activated.

CAUSE
=====

This is because the Windows Clipboard pastes the image into the message using a
device-dependent format based on the video driver. Once the message reaches the
recipient's machine, the image will only be seen if the video driver can
understand the information from the sender's machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

The sender should paste the image into Paintbrush, then save it as a bitmap
(.BMP) file. The sender can attach the .BMP to the Mail message. Because .BMP
files are device-independent, all recipients will be able to see the image when
they double-click the Paintbrush icon in the Mail message, assuming they have
Paintbrush installed.
