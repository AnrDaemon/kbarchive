-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Golf 2.0 does not recognize some of the Links championship courses provided by
Access Software Inc., even though the Links course has been converted
successfully through the conversion tool.

For the course to be used, it will need to be reinstalled from the original Links
disks using the Links 386Pro option during setup.

Once installation is complete, the course can then be copied into the MSGOLF
directory to be used by Golf 2.0.

For more information about how to copy files in Windows, see your Windows printed
documentation or online Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Golf 2.0 uses the hi-res (*.CRH) course instead of the low-res (*.CRS)
course used by Microsoft Golf 1.0 and Access Links. To use an existing low-res
course, Golf 2.0 provides a conversion tool allowing the low-res course to be
converted.

However, the newer courses and some of the older courses manufactured by Access
Software will not be recognized by Golf even after being converted. These
courses need to be installed using the original disk as a Links 386Pro course.

Access Software should be contacted at (801) 359-2900 if problems arise during
the installation procedure.
