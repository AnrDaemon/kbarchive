TITLE   :Error Using Quick Connect and Password Protected Shares
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a mapped network drive in Windows Explorer, you receive the
following error message:

   <path>:\ is not accessible. The specified network password is not
   correct.

If you click the Retry button, the error message is repeated.

CAUSE
=====

The network drive is mapped to a password-protected share, but the Save This
Password check box for the mapped drive is not checked. Also, the Quick Logon
option button is selected in the Client For Microsoft Network property sheet.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remap the network drive and click the Save This Password check box so that the
password for the network share is saved. If you do not want the password to be
cached, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Network icon.

3. In the "The following network components are installed" box, click Client For
   Microsoft Networks.

4. Click the Properties button.

5. Click the "Logon and restore network connections" option button.

6. Click the OK button. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click
   the Yes button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you click the Save This Password check box when you map a network drive, the
password for that drive is cached and you are not asked for a password again
when you select the drive in Windows Explorer.

If the password is not cached, you must supply the password when you try to use
the drive. If the Quick Logon option is selected, no network connection is
established until you try to access the drive.

If the "Logon and restore network connections" option is selected, a network
connection is established when you start Windows 95 and you are prompted for a
password for the mapped drive. After you have supplied the correct password for
the drive, the drive is available.
