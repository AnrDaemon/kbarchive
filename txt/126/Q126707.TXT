SUMMARY
=======

In level 70 of Chip's Challenge, Chip must pass over several brown buttons that
release different monsters from bear traps. The monsters chase Chip as he makes
his way through the maze.

However, two of the brown buttons, one on the lower-left part of the maze and one
on the lower-right part of the maze, do not activate the bear traps associated
with them. As a result, Chip can pass around two of the monsters without being
hindered.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this level, titled Nightmare, Chip has 199 seconds to complete the maze. Chip
does not have to pick up any computer chips, but he does have to be quick to
avoid capture by any monsters. Several brown buttons along the route of the maze
release a monster from a bear trap. Chip must avoid these monsters to finish.

In separate areas of the maze, two of the bear traps, one holding a paramecia and
the other holding a tooth monster do not get activated when Chip passes over the
associated brown buttons. As a result, Chip has easy passage through these parts
of the maze.
