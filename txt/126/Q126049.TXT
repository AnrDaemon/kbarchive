SUMMARY

The Dunker Tool allows you to format the font of an entire document in one step.
Your next document, however, uses the default font and font size. To continue

2. Select the Letterizer Tool, and select the desired font.

3. In Creative Writer for Windows, hold down the CTRL key and click the Dunker
   Tool.

   In Creative Writer for the Macintosh, hold down the COMMAND key and click the
   Dunker Tool.

To set the default font size during the current session of Creative Writer:

2. Select the Word Sizer Tool, and select the desired font size.

3. In Creative Writer for Windows, hold down the CTRL key and click the Dunker

Font colors and font styles cannot be maintained from document to document, even
within the same session of Creative Writer.
