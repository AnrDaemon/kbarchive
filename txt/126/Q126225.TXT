TITLE   :PRB: GetGlyphOutLine() Causes GPF Under Chinese Windows 3.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Traditional Chinese Windows version 3.1, if GetGlyphOutLine() is called
many times (more than 1000 times) on a Chinese font that's larger than 100
points, the GDI heap will be eroded rapidly and the application will eventually
fail giving a general protection (GP) fault.

RESOLUTION
==========

If GetGlyphOutLine() needs to be called repeatedly on a Chinese font, please set
the font size to be no larger than 100pt.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
