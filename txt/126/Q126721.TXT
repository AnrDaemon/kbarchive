TITLE   :WTBackup Fails to Create Complete System Backup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The WTBackup (version 1.13) tool that is shipped with the Corel SCSI package
cannot perform a complete system backup of Windows 95 systems. WTBackup reports
that it is unable to back up certain files that are busy. The following files
are examples of files that may be listed as being busy:

 - CAB32.EXE

 - ADVAPI32.DLL

 - COMCTL32.DLL

 - GDI32.DLL

 - ICM32.DLL

 - KERNEL32.DLL

 - LINKINFO.DLL

 - MPR.DLL

 - MSNET32.DLL

 - LANGEXC.NLS

CAUSE
=====

These are 32-bit files. Windows 95 opens many 32-bit files using extended file
handles. Files opened in this manner cannot be recognized in the MS- DOS file
system, which WTBackup uses to identify all open files. WTBackup displays the
warning because it is unable to access those files opened with extended file
handles.

STATUS
======

This behavior is caused by new features included with Windows 95. Contact Corel
about possible upgrades to the WTBackup tool.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WTBackup is manufactured by Corel Systems Corporation, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
