TITLE   :PCM and PGC Cannot Connect to Servers With Long Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother kbPCM kbPGC smspcm smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Package Command Manager (PCM) or Program Group Control (PGC) attempt to
connect to some logon servers, they error messages indicating that they were
unable to complete their configurations appear. Other servers work properly. PCM
indicates that it was unable to find a server. PGC indicates that it could not
complete updating the client; the SMSLOG.TXT shows that Error 20 occurred. Any
connections to servers than contain 12 characters or less work correctly. When
you run the /DEBUG switch or watch a network trace of the transaction, you see
that the programs appear to be connecting to the server properly.

CAUSE
=====

The applications are attempting to connect to a logon server with more than 12
characters in it's server name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use 12 or fewer characters for the server name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.
