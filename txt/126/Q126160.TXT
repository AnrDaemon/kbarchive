SYMPTOMS
========

When you install an MS-DOS-based game in a full-screen MS-DOS window on a
computer with the Microsoft Windows Sound System installed, the game fails to
detect the Windows Sound System sound card.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the game requires that an IRQ from 0 to 7 be used
for the sound card but the sound card is set to an IRQ higher than 7. The
Windows Sound System (WSS) can use IRQ 7, 9, 10, or 11. If there is a known
working configuration using IRQ 7, Windows 95 will use the existing
configuration. If there is no existing configuration using IRQ 7, Windows 95
will assign IRQ 7 to a device only as a last resort in order to not conflict
with the Enhanced Capabilities port (ECP).

The following games are known to fail to detect the WSS sound card:

 - 7th Guest

 - Kings Quest V

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change WSS to use IRQ 7. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, and then click Properties on
   the menu that appears.

2. Click the Device Manager tab.

3. Double-click the Sound Video And Game Controllers entry.

4. Click the MS Windows Sound System entry and then click the Properties button.

5. Click the Resources tab.

6. Change the Interrupt Request setting to 07.

7. Click OK to accept the settings.

After you make this change, the MS-DOS-based game should detect the WSS sound
card as a Sound Blaster sound card.
