TITLE   :Registry Editor "Save Subtree As" Does Not Complete
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Registry Editor and back up the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree by
choosing Save Subtree As from the File menu, the entire tree is not saved.
Although Registry Editor appears to finish saving the file, it stops at
software\microsoft\windows nt\current version\perflib\009. It does not save the
rest of the subtree information.

Save Subtree As works correctly with the other subtrees.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you need to back up the registry, use Windows NT Backup or RDISK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
