SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on an Intel Xpress Deskside/MX 66Mhz Dual Pentium,
your computer stops responding (hangs) for about ten minutes, after Setup
reboots the computer the first time. The following error message appears:

   INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE

This problem occurs when Setup selects MPS 1.1 Multiprocessor PC as the system
type. This problem does not occur when you select Standard PC.

NOTE: Selecting MPS 1.1 Multiprocessor PC causes HALMPS.DLL to be installed.
Selecting Standard PC causes HAL.DLL to be installed.

CAUSE
=====

Older Mylex Firmware doesn't respond in the time-out period allotted during the
SCSI ENQUIRY2 command initialization.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest
