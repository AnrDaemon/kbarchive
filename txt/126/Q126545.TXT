When you are using two network adapters connected to two separate Novell
networks using the Microsoft client for Novell NetWare or a Novell NetWare
Workstation shell, Windows 95 sees only one of the two networks.

CAUSE

network adapters to receive a response from a NetWare server will be the active
network adapter.
