PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork kbsetup smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify the location of the thesaurus during a workstation installation
of Word for Windows version 6.0 on a Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 system,
Systems Management Server version 1.0 overwrites the user-modified entries in
the WINWORD6.INI file with the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) location of the
Windows for Workgroups shared thesaurus.

For example, after you install Word for Windows, the WINWORD6.INI file contains:

   [Microsoft Word]
   Thesaurus 1033,0=\\<server name>\<share name>\PROOF\MSTHES.DLL,
   \\<server name>\<share name>\PROOF\MSTH_AM.LEX

You modify the WINWORD6.INI file to read:

   [Microsoft Word]
   Thesaurus 1033,0=C:\WINWORD\PROOF\MSTHES.DLL,
   C:\WINWORD\PROOF\MSTH_AM.LEX

After you install SMS, the WINWORD6.INI file contains:

   [Microsoft Word]
   Thesaurus 1033,0=\\<server name>\<share name>\PROOF\MSTHES.DLL,
   \\<server name>\<share name>\PROOF\MSTH_AM.LEX

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
