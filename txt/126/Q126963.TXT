The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, you receive the following error
message:

   The following error occurred while loading protocol number 0

   Error 5123: The computer name you specified is already in use on the network.
   Choose the Network Icon in Control Panel to specify a different name. For
   more information choose the Help button.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if you have multiple network cards in your computer running
on a single network segment and you are using the NetBEUI network protocol. The
NetBEUI protocol tries to register the same computer name on the network once
for each network card in the computer. When NetBEUI tries to register the second
card on the network with the same computer name as the first card, the error
occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use Network Setup to remove the NetBEUI protocol from all but one of the network
cards in your computer.
