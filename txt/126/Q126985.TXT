TITLE   :INFO: Unattended Setup Switch Fails to Run
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The command for unattended setup, WINNT /U, does not run as stated on page 99 of
the "Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit Volume 1: Windows NT Resource Guide." It
states that syntax for the command is:

      winnt /u[:answer_file]

-or-

      winnt32 /u[:answer_file]

The WINNT /U switch does not work without the /S:<SOURCE PATH> switch, as
specified in the SETUPMGR.TXT file provided with the Microsoft Windows NT
Resource Kit software.

NOTE: WINNT32 /U works as documented in the "Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit
Volume 1: Windows NT Resource Guide."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information, taken from the SETUPMGR.TXT file, correctly documents
the use of the unattended setup command:

      The saved answer files can be executed at the command line
      in conjunction with the winnt or winnt32 commands. The syntax
      for the commands is shown below.

      winnt /u:<answer file> /s:<source path>

If you use the WINNT /U command without adding the /S<SOURCE PATH> switch,
Windows NT command help is displayed, just as it is when you run WINNT with the
/? switch; it lists all of the documented switches for the WINNT command, but
does not start Windows NT Setup.

USE OF THE / B SWITCH
---------------------

The SETUPMGR.TXT file also states, in the following text, that the use of the /B
switch is optional when you run WINNT; it is not.

      Other winnt and winnt32 switches that make unattended
      installations go easier are:

         /B    to eliminate the need for the
               multiple setup floppy disks.

Contrary to this statement, just specifying the /U switch will include the floppy
diskless setup feature. The functionality of the /B switch is included in the /U
switch, and therefore does not need to be specified at the command line. The /B
switch is correctly documented on page 99 of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource
Kit Volume 1: Windows NT Resource Guide.
