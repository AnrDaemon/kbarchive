TITLE   :PC DirSync: Import -X Fails for SNADS Gateway
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0a,3.2,3.2a,3.5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0a, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

IMPORT.EXE may fail to extract SNADS addresses from a gateway postoffice if the
gateway name was installed with one of the following names:

   MSMAIL
   FAX
   MCI
   X400
   SMTP
   MHS

IMPORT.EXE recognizes these names as specific types of gateways, and they should
not be used for the name of the SNADS gateway.

If one of these names is used, the command line

   IMPORT Admin -ppassword -dm -gSNADS -ftest.txt -x

will fail to create the expected text in the file TEST.TXT. However, no error
message will be received.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be corrected by changing the SNADS gateway name to a unique
network name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During installation of the SNADS gateway, step 3 prompts for the gateway name
and the following message appears:

   Note: This must be a unique network name.

The SNADS installation program will allow input of the gateway names listed above
if these gateways are not currently installed. However, IMPORT.EXE will not
properly initialize the DGN's for the SNADS gateway if one of these names is
used for as the gateway name.
