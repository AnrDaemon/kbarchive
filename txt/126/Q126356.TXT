TITLE   :GSI IDE Controller Forces Real-Mode Drivers

KEYWORDS:diskmem win95 kbDiskMemory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a GSI IDE controller in a computer running Windows 95,
protected-mode IDE controller support may not be loaded.

CAUSE
=====

The GSI IDE controller BIOS forces you to remove hard disks on the primary
controller in the computer's CMOS settings. Windows 95 Setup does not always
detect the GSI controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use a protected-mode IDE controller driver with a GSI IDE controller, follow
these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Add New Hardware icon.

2. Follow the instructions in the Add New Hardware Wizard. Let the wizard detect
   the new controller automatically and install the driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been confirmed to occur with the following IDE controllers:

 - GSI model 4C

 - GSI model 18

 - GSI model 21V

GSI states that with a primary hard disk controller, the hard disk must be listed
as type 1 in the computer's CMOS settings for their controller to work.

GSI also states that if there is any device on the secondary IDE controller, the
CMOS settings must not list the hard disk drives at all.


To determine whether Windows 95 is using a protected-mode IDE controller driver,
follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, and then click Properties on
   the menu that appears.

2. Click the Performance tab. If your computer is using a protected-mode driver,
   the status for File System reads "32-bit."

Note that the File System status is intended to represent whether both
protected-mode IDE controller support (FastDisk or 32-bit disk access) and
32-bit file access (VFAT) is being provided. VFAT is always provided in Windows
95, so the file system operates entirely in 32-bit mode if protected-mode IDE
controller support is provided.
