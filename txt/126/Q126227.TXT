SYMPTOMS
========

An application will stop responding (hang) if you print to a file with a comma
in its file or directory name. 32-bit applications such as Notepad hang and
cannot be ended from Task Manager. 16-bit applications such as Write hang. If
you end them with Task Manager, the entire Windows-on- Windows (WOW) subsystem
will be terminated. However, the hanging 16-bit application will not terminate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0.
