======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may encounter problems when you attempt to establish a connection to a
remote NetWare Server from a Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) client that
is dialing into a Windows NT RAS Server. This problem will occur if the NetWare
Server and the Windows NT RAS Server are on different network segments.

To correct this problem, assign a unique IPX network number to the segment that
the Windows NT RAS Server is located on. Alternatively, install the NetWare
Server on the same network segment as the Windows NT RAS Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 3.5x
---------------

To assign a unique IPX network number to the network segment that the Windows NT
RAS Server is located on, perform the following steps:

1. Determine a unique IPX network number. That is one that does not conflict
   with any previously assigned IPX network numbers.

2. On the Windows NT RAS Server, choose Network in Control Panel.

3. In the list of Installed Network Software, select NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible
   Transport.

4. Choose the Configure button.

5. In the Adapter box, select the network card driver.

6. Enter the unique IPX network number from Step 1 above into the Internal
   Network Number box.

7. Choose the OK button in both the NWLink IPX/SPX Protocol Configuration dialog
   box and the Network Settings dialog box.

8. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

In Windows NT version 4.0, you can change both the (external) network number and
internal network number through the Graphic User Interface (GUI) in Control
Panel. Use the following steps:

To set or change the external network number:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network, click Protocols, and double-click NWLink IPX/SPX
   Compatible Transport.

3. Select the appropriate adapter in the Adapter list and click the Manual Frame
   Type Detection radio button.

4. Click Add, select the correct frame type and type your unique (external)
   network number.
