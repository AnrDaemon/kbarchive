The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print a document in Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups
version 3.1 or 3.11 after you upgrade from Windows version 3.0, you receive the
error message:

   Error reading spooler temp file

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you are using Windows version 3.0 Print Manager in Windows
or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, expand the PRINTMAN.EX_ file from your original Windows
or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11 disks to your Windows directory
using the command

   expand <source>:\printman.ex_
   <dest>:\<windows>\printman.exe

where <source> is the floppy disk drive containing the original Windows or
Windows for Workgroups disk, <dest> is the hard disk on your computer
containing your Windows directory, and <windows> is the Windows directory.
For example, if the original Windows disk is in drive A and your Windows
directory is called WINDOWS on drive C, use the command:

   expand a:\printman.ex_ c:\windows\printman.exe

The PRINTMAN.EX_ file is located on the following disks:

   Product/Version               3.5" HD Disk #   5.25" HD Disk #
