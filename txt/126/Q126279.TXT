SYMPTOMS
========

IRQs 14 and 15 are enabled even if there is nothing attached to the IDE
controllers.

CAUSE
=====

Some computers come with dual IDE controllers on the PCI bus. When Windows 95
detects the dual IDE controllers it reserves IRQs 14 and 15 for them even if
there are no devices attached to the controllers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To free one of the IRQs, follow these steps:

1. Disable the appropriate IDE controller in the computer's BIOS.

2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click the System icon.

4. Click the Device Manager tab.

5. Double-click Hard Disk Controllers.

6. Under Hard Disk Controllers, click the controller you want to disable and
   then click the Properties button.

7. In the Device Usage box, click the check box for the configuration in which
   you want to disable the controller, and then click the OK button.
