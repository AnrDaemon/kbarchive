SUMMARY
=======

The following statement can be used in your Remote Access Service (RAS) SLIP/PPP
logon script (SWITCH.INF file) to bypass the banner text of your service
provider:

   LOOP=<ignore>

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many service providers send a long welcome and instruction text banner each time
you logon. You can use the LOOP=<ignore><cr> statement in your
automated logon script, to bypass an unknown number of text banner lines.

For example:

   COMMAND=
   OK=<match>"Enter User Name:"
   ERROR_NO_CARRIER=<match>"NO CARRIER"
   LOOP=<ignore>

This set of commands causes the blank COMMAND= to be issued until Enter User
Name: is matched. Therefore, any lines of text sent by the service provider
before Enter User Name: are ignored by your automated logon script.

For more information on using the SWITCH.INF to automate a logon, refer to
Knowledge Base article Q125975.
