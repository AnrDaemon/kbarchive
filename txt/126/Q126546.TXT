TITLE   :Problems Running SNA Server 5250 Applet (Autoconnect Enabled)
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the SNA Server 2.1 5250 applet, and the 5250 Session/Autoconnect
switch is enabled, the following problems can occur:

 - When connecting over any SNA Server client-server interface that requires a
   user logon (TCP/IP sockets, NetWare IPX/SPX, or Banyan IP):

    - The session does not automatically activate.

    - Connecting the session resulting in the Interface Not Found" error
      message.

    - The following error message appears when you quit the 5250 applet:

   SNASRV caused a General Protection Fault in module SNASRV.EXE at 0001:0589

    - When the SNA client login fails and you select Close, the client machine
      stops responding (hang).

 - When connecting over the SNA Server client-server named pipes interface, if
   WNAP fails to start due to a 629 or 546 error (where the client cannot find
   or connect to an SNA Server), the following error appears:

   TP Started verb has completed with primary
   return code Unexpected DOS Error:

   Primary Return Code = F011
   Secondary Return Code = 08000000


CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server 5250 applet does not wait long enough for the underlying SNA
client module (WNAP) to initialize, and then fails to work properly when WNAP
fails to initialize.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this problem in SNA Server version 2.1, configure WNAP to start
before the 5250 applet is started. To do this, add a WNAP.EXE icon to the
Windows or Windows for Workgroups Startup group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.1. This
problem was corrected in SNA Server version 2.11.
