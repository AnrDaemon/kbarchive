TITLE   :DCs Fail to Synchronize or Validate Users Over NWLINK
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Netlogon services may fail. Users may fail to be logged on and
servers may be unable to synchronize. The following errors may appear be or
reported in the system log:

   1311 There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon
   request.

   5719 No windows NT domain controller is available for domain...

   3096 The Windows NT domain controller for this domain could not be located.

   3210 Failed to authenticate with <computer name>, a Windows NT domain
   controller for domain <name>.

   5723 The session setup from the computer <computer name> failed to
   authenticate. The name of the account referenced in the security database is
   <name>. The following error occurred: Access is denied.


CAUSE
=====

When the default protocol becomes inoperable, Netlogon fails to complete
operations because it does not attempt to use other installed protocols.

NOTE: Protocols can become inoperable when catastrophic infrastructure problems
occur involving routers or network addressing.


RESOLUTION
==========

Netlogon has been updated. When Netlogon receives an error responding to a
mailslot message from the first protocol that it attempts to use, it responds to
duplicates of the original message received by all available protocols. Datagram
mailslot messages are used by Netlogon to initiate client logon operations and
inter-domain operations including the synchronization of domain controllers
(DCs). By responding to all messages received, Netlogon responds successfully,
even if an individual protocol is not operating properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for Windows NT. For
