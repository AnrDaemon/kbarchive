The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are typing, quotation marks ("), carets (^), apostrophes ('), and
tildes (~) do not appear until you press another key.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you have the US-International keyboard layout loaded,
and is designed to let you use accented characters without remapping the
keyboard.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change this behavior, use the International tool in Control Panel to change
the keyboard layout from US-International to US.
