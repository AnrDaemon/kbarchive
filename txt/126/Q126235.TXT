SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the Setup program from Flight Simulator, version 5.0 on
a computer using a 486 DX/4 processor or an Intel overdrive 63MHz Pentium
processor (part number PODP5V63), you may receive the following error message:

This issue does not occur in Flight Simulator, version 5.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the self-extracting Overdrv.exe
file.

not function correctly on all Intel Pentium- or DX/4 Overdrive-based computers.
If you install the Overdrv.exe file on a computer based on a different processor
or a computer running Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1, Flight Simulator may not
function properly.
