TITLE   :Windows NT Setup Fails when SCSI Controller is Not Detected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the upgrade process to Windows NT version 3.5, Setup does not detect the
SCSI controller on your computer. When you supply the driver from the SCSI
controller manufacturer, the computer stops responding (hangs) or the following
message appears:

   STOP 0x0000007B
   Inaccessible Boot Device


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Setup fails to copy the SCSI controller driver from the
manufacturer-supplied disk to the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are installing Windows NT on to a file allocation table (FAT) volume:

1. After Windows NT Setup reboots the computer (after the MS-DOS-based portion
   of Windows NT Setup completes), place an MS-DOS boot disk in the bootable
   floppy disk drive (usually drive A).

2. Copy the manufacturer-supplied driver to the following directory:

   %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS

3. Restart the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
