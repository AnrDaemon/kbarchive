SYMPTOMS

When you attempt to play an audio clip in one of the applications listed at the
top of this article while running RAM Doubler 1.5.1 is running, the sound may
not play. The progress bar will begin at the beginning of the play status bar
and then immediately jump to the end without playing the audio clip.

sounds selected in the Gallery do not play even though the Apple CD-Audio player
may be able to play music CDs.

In The Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean, sound will play in some places of the
program but not in other places.
