TITLE   :SMS Administrator Err Msg: Socket () failed, 10047
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use Systems Management Server Administrator to remotely
control a NetWare client, the following error message appears and remote control
is not available for any NetWare clients:

   Socket () failed, 10047

CAUSE
=====

Although remote control of NetWare clients uses IPX sockets, SMS Administrator
requires the NetBIOS NWBLINK driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NetBIOS support for NWLINK (NWBLINK) is installed under Windows NT when you
install NWLINK. However, if you install a Windows NT service that requires
NWLINK, and you have not yet installed NWLINK support, NWBLINK is not installed.
This happens when you install Gateway Services for Netware (GSNW) on a Windows
NT server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, remove and reinstall NWLINK so that NWBLINK is
installed, and then install the other software that depends on NWLINK.
