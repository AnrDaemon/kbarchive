TITLE   :Using Communications Applications When RAS Server is Running

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

You may be unable to access a serial port in a communication application while
the Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) server software is running. For
example, if the RAS server service is running, and you have configured RAS so
that your modem on COM1 accepts RAS dial-in, the following error message appears
if you attempt to use COM1 in Windows NT Terminal:

   The selected COM port is either not supported or is being used by another
   device.

   Select another port.

You can temporarily disable the RAS server service, so you can use the COM port
to dial out using another communications application, by writing a simple batch
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following batch file to temporarily stop the RAS server service and run
Windows NT Terminal:

   net stop remoteaccess

 c:\winnt\system32\terminal.exe

   net start remoteaccess

Save the batch file and create an icon for it. The batch file disables the RAS
server service, making the port available for dial- out, and then restarts the
RAS server service once you quit your communications application.

NOTE: This procedure is not necessary if you dial-out using the RAS client
software. The RAS client temporarily disables the RAS server service so that the
port can be used for dialing-out.

Stopping the RAS server service stops the service for all serial ports that have
been configured to allow dial-in. If you have multiple ports configured for
dial-in, you may want to reserve one of the ports for dial- out by not
configuring it to allow RAS dial-in, rather than disabling the RAS server
service.

Only user accounts that have permission to start and stop a service can use this
workaround.
