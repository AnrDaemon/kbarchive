OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose the Letterizer Tool in Creative Writer, only Impact, Lucida
Sans, Lucida Handwriting, Lucida Blackletter, and Stencil are listed. Any other
Windows TrueType fonts installed on the computer are not displayed in the
Creative Writer font list.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem in Windows 3.x, use the following steps:

1. In Program Manager, run Control Panel from the Main group.

2. Double-click the Fonts icon.

3. Select the TrueType fonts. Choose the Remove button.

4. You receive a dialog box that says

   Are you sure you want to remove the <name> (TrueType) font?

   where <name> is the name of the TrueType font.

   Make sure that the Delete Font File From Disk check box is not selected.
   Choose the Yes To All button.

5. Choose the Add button in the Fonts dialog box. You receive an Add Fonts
   dialog box that by default selects your Windows directory.

6. In the Windows directory, select the SYSTEM subdirectory (font files are
   stored in the SYSTEM subdirectory). Choose the Select All button, then choose
   OK. After the fonts are installed, close Control Panel.

7. In the Main group in Program Manager, open File Manager.

8. Locate the MSKIDS\SHARED directory. Select the MSKIDS.INF file, and delete
   it. When you run Creative Writer again, it re-creates the MSKIDS.INF file.

After following these steps, all Windows TrueType fonts should appear in Creative
Writer when you choose the Letterizer Tool.
