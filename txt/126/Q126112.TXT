When you use the Zoom Out and Render options from within the Modeling Wright
module, the sky appears beneath the earth.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft's The Ultimate Frank
Lloyd Wright version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright and select Modeling from the main
   screen. The blue circular object on the main screen is the Modeling
   selection.

   NOTE: Placing the mouse cursor over each circular object reveals the subject
   of the object. For example, place the mouse over the blue circle, and the
   title Modeling Wright appears. Placing the mouse over the partial green
   circular object reveals the Library.

2. After making changes to the structure, choose Visualize.

3. Press the Zoom Out option and reduce the object to approximately one half the
   original size.

4. Choose Render.

5. The sky color appears beneath the earth.
