The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0

When you print from a Macintosh client computer to a non-Postscript
printer that supports up to 600 dots per inch (DPI), and it is connected to
a Windows NT Server running the Services for Macintosh, 300 DPI is the
maximum resolution you can use. However, if you print to a Postscript
printer, you can print at 600 DPI.

Windows NT functions this way by design. The printer driver for Windows NT
uses basic raster image processors (RIP) for non-Postscript printers.
Contact third-party printer manufacturers for additional information on
full-featured RIPs.
