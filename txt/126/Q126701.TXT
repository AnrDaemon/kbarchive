The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article expands on the Help information found in the Windows NT Remote
Access Service (RAS) client (RASPHONE.HLP) and describes a more convenient way
to gain network access to a RAS server domain other than the RAS client's
domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you do not use the Authenticate Using Current User Name And Password option
in RAS and you request Help in the Authentication dialog box, information
appears describing how to log onto a domain other than the RAS client's domain.
This Help information also describes how to avoid having to press CTRL+ALT+DEL
every time you log on to that domain.

However, the Help information does not mention that your Windows NT RAS client
will cache your remote logon credentials after you have logged onto the domain
the first time, allowing subsequent logons to the domain to be automated.

To do this, connect to the RAS server and log on to its domain once as described
in the Help information (by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL). After that, log on to its
domain before you are connected to the RAS server and allow Windows NT to log
you automatically with cached credentials when you connect.
