PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from a Macintosh computer to a non-PostScript printer attached to
a Microsoft Windows NT server running Microsoft Windows NT Services for
Macintosh (SFM), some characters may print with a thin horizontal line across
part of a character.

This problem occurs with specific combinations of characters, point sizes, and
typefaces.

CAUSE
=====

The PostScript processor built into Windows NT Services for Macintosh
incorrectly prints the extraneous line.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to work around this problem by using a slightly different point
size or typeface, or by printing to an actual PostScript printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix. This is a hotfix, and
distribution requires manager approval. To receive the hotfix, customers must be
encountering the bug as described above. You must track the customers you send
this to and supply them with the next Service Pack when it becomes available. To
obtain the new file, contact the Escalation Team.
