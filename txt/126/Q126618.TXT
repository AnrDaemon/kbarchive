TITLE   :Cannot See All NetWare Volumes from Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT machines do not see all available NetWare volumes on a NetWare server
when you browse the network or run NET VIEW. MS-DOS-based and Windows-based
network clients have no problems seeing all the shared resources on the same
NetWare server.

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs when there is a problem with the NetWare server bindery.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, run the NetWare server BINDFIX utility. It may be
necessary to perform a more thorough check of the NetWare Bindery than BINDFIX
can perform. On one occasion the problem with the Bindery didn't show up until
the user attempted restore it to a new NetWare server.
