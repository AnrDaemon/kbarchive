TITLE   :Clients Cannot Run NetWare System Utilities Through GSNW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a client computer is connected to a NetWare server shared by Gateway Service
for NetWare (GSNW) on a Windows NT Server, you cannot use any of the supported
NetWare system utilities (Syscon, PConsole, Whoami, Filer, etc.) or
NetWare-aware applications from the client computer.

CAUSE
=====

The NetWare system utilities and NetWare-aware applications use NetWare client
application program interface (API) calls. A client computer connected to a
shared NetWare resource through a Windows NT Server running GNSW, sends and
receives information through a Server Message Block (SMB)- based redirector that
cannot interpret any of the NetWare API calls or NCP packets. Client Service for
NetWare and Gateway Service for NetWare interpret NetWare API calls through
NWRDR.SYS, but only for local processes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To run the NetWare system utilities and NetWare-aware applications on the client
computer:

1. If the client computer is a Windows NT Workstation, install the Client
   Service for NetWare.

2. If the client computer is using an operating system other than Windows NT,
   install the NetWare drivers and redirectors in real mode according to the
   following conditions:

   - If you are using Novell NetWare to work with IPXODI.COM, add the following
   lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   LSL
   <appropriate ODI driver for your network card>
   IPXODI
   NETX /ps=<preferred server name>

   - If you are using Novell NetWare to work with IPX.COM, add the following
   lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

   IPX
   NETX /ps=<preferred server name>
