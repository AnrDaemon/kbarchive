SUMMARY
=======

There are two message classes that are supported under Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks: Interpersonal Messages (IPM) and Interprocess Communications (IPC).

MORE INFORMATION
================

IPC messages are a special type of message that do not appear in the Microsoft
Mail for Windows Inbox. The Common Mail Calls (CMC) API, which uses the X.400
standard for electronic messaging, does not support this message class.
Therefore, a read function using the appropriate CMC call will not be able to
access a message of IPC message class.

CMC does support the following message types: CMC:IPM, CMC:IP RN, CMC:IP NRN,
CMC:DR, and CMC:NDR.

More information on the supported message classes for CMC can be obtained from
the "CMC API Specification," version 1.0, dated June 1, 1993.
