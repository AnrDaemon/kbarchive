TITLE   :WinNT 3.5 RAS Server Doesn't Call Back Non-3.5 Clients Over ISDN
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT 3.5 computer running Remote Access Service (RAS) fails to complete
a callback to non-Windows NT 3.5 ISDN RAS clients (including Windows NT 3.1 RAS
clients, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS clients, and RAS 1.1a clients).

The non-Windows NT 3.5 RAS client times out while waiting for the callback. The
RAS server stays in a "calling back user" state and maintains control of the
port.

NOTE: This problem only occurs when connecting over ISDN.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the Windows NT 3.5 file, RASSRV.EXE. From Tony Bell:
"Change made to RASSRV.EXE to set the framing type to AMB. This causes the
Pcimac driver to start its inband negotiation from the server side and keeps the
client from being stuck waiting for this negotiation to begin."

WORKAROUND
----------

Use Windows NT 3.5 for both the RAS client and RAS server.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
