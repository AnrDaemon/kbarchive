-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Running Microsoft Access 2 for Windows ISBN 1-55615-592-1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Running Microsoft Access 2 for Windows."

The following topics are covered:

 - Page 161: Tip Selects but Cannot Delete Non-contiguous Lines

 - DISK: PROMPT.MDB not on disk. (Need to run Install)

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Page 161: Tip Selects but Cannot Delete Non-contiguous Lines
------------------------------------------------------------

The tip on page 161 describes how to make non-contiguous selections. This tip
works correctly; however, it is inappropriate for this tip to be under the
heading "Deleting Fields," since you will not be able to delete fields selected
in this way.

Correction:

This tip should be removed from page 161.

Comments:

The tip is technically correct, and it is useful for some actions other than
deleting fields. A future edition of the book will incorporate this information
in a more appropriate location.

DISK: PROMPT.MDB not on disk.  (Need to run Install)
----------------------------------------------------

The companion disk does not contain a file named PROMPT.MDB. However, there is a
non-Microsoft Access file named PROMPT.CMP.

The Prompt Database is compressed on the 3.5-inch disk as PROMPT.CMP. To properly
install this file, run INSTALL.EXE from the companion disk. The Install program
automatically decompresses the Prompt database. Please see page xxiv for
companion disk installation instructions.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
