The following C code illustrates a successful call to this function. This example
allows address browsing only. The code was compiled, linked, and ran
successfully using Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.5.

      /* start code for MAPIAddress() call */ 
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <windows.h>
      #include <mapi.h>

      lpMapiRecipDesc lppNewRecips;

      int main(void)
   {
        LHANDLE lhSession;
        ULONG rc, lpnNewRecips = 0;

        rc = MAPILogon(0L, "", "", MAPI_LOGON_UI, 0L, &lhSession);

        rc = MAPIAddress(lhSession, 0L, NULL, 0L, NULL, 0L, NULL, 0L, 0L, \ 
        &lpnNewRecips, &lppNewRecips);

        if( rc != SUCCESS_SUCCESS )
           printf("MAPIAddress failed with %d", rc);

        rc=MAPIFreeBuffer(lppNewRecips);/* free the memory used by MAPIAddress
      */ 

        rc = MAPILogoff(lhSession, 0L, 0L, 0L);

       return (0);

      }
