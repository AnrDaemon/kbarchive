The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Microsoft Mail for Windows on a workstation that connects to a
postoffice on a Microsoft LAN Manager for UNIX Server, the Windows Mail client
may randomly lose its connection to the mail message file (MMF). This will
result in the Network Disconnect icon appearing in the Status bar.

CAUSE
=====

The LAN Manager for UNIX Servers have a default setting that limits how large of
a file each workstation can access. By default, this is 20 megabytes. If the MMF
grows to be greater than 20 MB in size, the user will not be able to send or
receive new mail.


RESOLUTION
==========

Delete old mail from the MMF to free up some space, or modify the setting at the
server that limits the size of any file that the workstation can access.
