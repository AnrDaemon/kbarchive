SUMMARY
=======

After you install Windows 95 to a compressed SuperStore version 2.04 boot disk,
the F4 boot feature (start previous MS-DOS version) does not work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 correctly implements the F4 boot feature on SuperStore compressed
drives by updating the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files to have .DOS
extensions. SuperStore version 2.04, however, uses compression drivers that are
loaded when the CONFIG.SYS file is loaded. As a result, the AUTOEXEC.BAT and
CONFIG.SYS files on the host drive are not updated to have .DOS extensions by
Windows 95 Setup, and the SuperStore compression drivers that are loaded during
or after the processing of the CONFIG.SYS file are not loaded. There is no way
to work around this behavior other than to switch to a disk compression program
that loads its compression driver before the CONFIG.SYS file is processed.
