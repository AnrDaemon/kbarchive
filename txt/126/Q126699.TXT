PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are in the Modeling Wright module of The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright,
the ALT+TAB keystroke combination has no effect when the mouse is over certain
hot spots.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the mouse to the center of the display and press ALT+TAB.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ALT+TAB feature of Microsoft Windows is used to switch tasks from one
running application to another. When the mouse pointer is over a hot spot,
Modeling Wright prevents the use of task switching with the ALT+TAB key
combination.

NOTE: Hot Spots are the graphical items that become highlighted when the mouse
pointer is positioned over them (i.e. Zoom In. Zoom Out and Render). The Control
Bar at the bottom of the screen is also an area that will not allow ALT+TAB
functionality.
