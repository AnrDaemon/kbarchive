Microsoft Select is a set of CDs containing all of Microsoft's released products
in all available languages. This product allows you to create disk images and to
perform network installations.

The User's Guide provides instructions for creating Macintosh disk images. Below
is a different set of instructions for creating Macintosh disk images.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following instructions should be used when you create Macintosh disk
images.

   NOTE: In order to build master disks, your Macintosh must have at least 2
   megabytes (MB) of memory.

To build master disks for the Macintosh:

1. Select the Macintosh Select CD and start Disk Copy.

2. Click the Load Image File button.

   NOTE: Alternatively you can choose Load Disk Image from the File menu.

3. "Mac Select" should appear at the top of the current window.

4. Select your options (such as product and language) until you see the .IMAGE
   files. Select an image file to copy.

5. Choose Open.

6. If you are making more than one copy, choose "Multiple Copies" from the File
   menu, and click the Make Some Copies button.

   If you are making only one copy, choose "Single Copy" from the File menu and
   click the "Make a Copy" button.

7. Insert an unlocked floppy disk.

   If the floppy disk contains files, a message appears asking if you want to
   completely replace the contents. Click the Duplicate button to replace the
   contents; click the Eject button if you don't want to replace the contents.

8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 until all disk images for the product have been
   copied.
