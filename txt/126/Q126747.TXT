SYMPTOMS

Print Manager does not start automatically when you start Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11, even though you have shared a printer.

CAUSE
=====

File sharing is not enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Print Manager does not start automatically for print sharing, you may need to
enable file sharing along with print sharing. To enable file sharing, follow
these steps:

1. Double-click the Network Setup icon in the Network program group.

2. Choose the Sharing button.

3. Select the "I want to be able to give others access to my files" check box.

4. Choose the OK button.

5. Choose OK.

6. Choose OK to confirm the modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file.

7. Choose the Restart Windows button. NOTE: Make sure to save and close any open
   work on your computer before you choose this button.

You should also make sure that Print Manager is not loaded in the Startup program
group and that PRINTMAN.EXE is not specified in the "Load=" or the "Run=" line
in the WIN.INI file.
