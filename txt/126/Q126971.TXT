The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you address a message with the New Address button, if the mail address is
duplicated for more than one recipient, but the alias is unique, version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows will remove all but the first duplicated addresses.
If the alias is duplicated but the address is unique, a recipient will see the
alias duplicated on the To: or Cc: fields.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mail for Windows allows direct addressing though the New Address button in the
Address dialog box. For example, for the Network/Postoffice address type, you
may enter an Alias, Mailbox, Postoffice, and Network name. The Mailbox,
Postoffice, and Network name must be unique to resolve an address.

If two entries are added to a Compose Note with duplicate aliases but unique
Mailbox, Postoffice, and Network names, the recipients will see the message with
duplicate alias names. If two entries are added with different alias names but
duplicate Mailbox, Postoffice, and Network names, the recipients will only see
the first alias. All other duplicate Mailbox, Postoffice, and Network names will
be removed.
