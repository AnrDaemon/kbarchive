SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the File And Print Sharing network service for Novell NetWare
and you try to remove a large directory structure (with over 1000 entries) in
Windows Explorer or File Manager, you receive the following error message:

   A device is not functioning

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 Ncpserver Service maintains an internal search cache that allows
only 1000 entries. When you try to work with a directory structure with over
1000 entries, the cache is exceeded and entries beyond 1000 are not seen. This
causes the 1000th-oldest search handle to be invalid, generating the error
message stated above.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use Windows Explorer or File Manager to select the directory tree you want to
delete and try to delete it. When the error message occurs, select the tree and
try to delete it again. Repeat this process until the directory is deleted.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
