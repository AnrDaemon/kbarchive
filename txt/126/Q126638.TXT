   system (BBS) at (408)-955-0262.

2. If you are installing a workstation or a member server, do not install the
   network during Windows NT version 3.5 Setup. If you are installing a Primary
   or Backup Domain Controller, contact Madge Networks Technical Support at

   a. Run Control Panel and choose Network.

   b. In the Network Settings dialog box select Add Software.

   c. Choose "<Other> Requires disk from manufacturer" from the Network
      Software list box.
