SYMPTOMS
========

When you click on a doorway in the Microsoft Encarta 1994 edition of MindMaze,
you may receive the error:

   Sub Or Function Not Defined

The error seldom occurs if MindMaze is executed directly from File Manager.

CAUSE
=====

The problem has been observed with several Compaq Presario computers with
internal IDE CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM driver in the Config.sys file is
Cpqidecd.sys. These Compaq CD-ROM drives are apparently not being cached
properly by SMARTDrive.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: The following instructions discuss editing your Autoexec.bat file. For
more information about how to edit your Autoexec.bat file, see your MS- DOS
manual. If you are using Windows 95, use online Help to find the topic "editing
unformatted text files".

1. Disable CD-ROM caching by adding the /U switch to the Smartdrv.exe line in
   the Autoexec.bat file. For example, change the Smartdrv.exe line to:

   "C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE /U" (without the quotation marks)

   For more information about Smartdrv.exe, consult your Microsoft MS- DOS
   manual. Systems running Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 and 6.x can access comprehensive
   information about MS-DOS commands by typing "help" (without the quotation
   marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt. In Windows 95, you can enter "smartdrv
   /?" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt.

2. Increase the number of CD-ROM buffers to 20 by editing the line containing
   Mscdex.exe in the Autoexec.bat file. Increase the number after the /M: switch
   to 20. If this switch is not present, add /M:20 to the line containing
   Mscdex.exe.

   For more information about Mscdex.exe, consult your Microsoft MS-DOS manual.
   Systems running Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 and 6.x can access comprehensive
   information on MS-DOS commands by typing "help" (without the quotation marks)
   at the MS-DOS command prompt.

3. Save your changes and restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Smartdrv.exe
------------

The Smartdrv /U option does not load the CD-ROM caching module of SMARTDrive even
if you have a CD-ROM drive. If SMARTDrive is loaded with the /U switch, you
cannot enable CD-ROM drive caching.

Mscdex.exe
----------

The Mscdex /M: option specifies the number of sector buffers used to cache the
path table of a CD. Typically, each drive should have a minimum of four to five
buffers. The larger this number is, the less your computer will have to read
directly from the CD-ROM drive.


The Compaq Presario computer is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
