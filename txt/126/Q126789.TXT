KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When messages with attachments are received through the MHS Gateway, the
following error may occur:

   Outpost: Could not create Microsoft Mail mail item
   Outpost: General file I/O error

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when there is a problem with the subdirectories under
MAILDATA\ATT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, check the following:

1. Rights of ATT subdirectories. This should be read/write, and the
   subdirectories should not be marked as hidden.

2. Check to make sure all 16 subdirectories exist under the ATT subdirectory
   (AT0-AT9 and ATA-ATF). If any of these subdirectories does not exist, create
   it by using the MS-DOS MKDIR command or by choosing the File Manager Create
   Directory command.
