======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Many computers are equipped with both the 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch floppy drives
in one single unit. When you install Windows NT on a computer with this floppy
drive unit, the following error message may appear during Windows NT Setup Disk
2.

   STOP: 0x0000007B
   Inaccessible_Boot_Device

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the original path of the floppy drives has changed
through the BIOS configuration of the computer. Some computers that include the
two floppy drives in a single unit have a BIOS option to swap the floppy drives
logically without changing the hardware jumpers. This allows any one of the
floppy drives to become the "boot" floppy drive. When you install Windows NT,
this BIOS setting is ignored and the Windows NT kernel addresses the floppy
drives as configured with the jumpers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Do not use the DRIVE SWAPPING option in the computer system BIOS to change
   the logical configuration of the floppy drive letters. If you have changed
   the configuration, change it back to the original settings.

2. Make sure the jumpers on the floppy drive unit matches the drive types
   defined in the computer system BIOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error may also occur on systems with a LS/120 floppy disk drive installed.
