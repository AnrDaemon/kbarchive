TITLE   :Cannot Print to PostScript Printer on Novell Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a network printer on a Novell NetWare network, your print job
does not appear.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you enable the banner page and print to a PostScript
printer. By default, Novell NetWare print servers do not support banners on
PostScript printers.

NOTE: The Novell NetWare print server, not Windows 95, generates the banner page.
Windows 95 does not control whether or not the banner page is printed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Disable the banner page.

 - Print to a non-PostScript printer.

 - Contact Novell or your network administrator about enabling PostScript
   banners on the PostScript print server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have difficulties printing to a PostScript printer over a network, it may
be because banner pages are incorrectly configured on the NetWare server. Unless
banner pages are correctly configured on the NetWare server, they will cause
errors and nothing will print. To solve this problem, you can either disable
banner pages by removing the check mark from the Banner Pages box in Capture
printer properties, or contact your network administrator to correctly configure
banner pages on the NetWare server for a PostScript printer.
