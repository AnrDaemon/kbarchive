SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save a file as text only from Lotus 123 for Windows version
4.0 or 5.0 under Windows NT, the following error appears:

   Unable to access output device

This error also occurs when you print from Lotus 123 for MS-DOS using the
backslash key (/) instead of using the Windows menus to print.

CAUSE
=====

Lotus 123 exports text and prints through a the WINGEN.DRV driver. This driver
was developed by Lotus to work with Windows and does not work with Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, print to file using the Generic Text Only driver
included in Windows NT 3.51 or 4.00.
