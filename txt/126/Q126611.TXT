SUMMARY
=======

When you import the PROFS templates to a Mail for PC Networks postoffice, and
you include the T option within the import file (a text file containing user
updates A=Add, M=Modify, D=Delete, or R=Replace), this will create a new
template and remove all old template information. As a result, the template
information for existing users will be lost. This is okay if the intent is to
put in new template information for all users.

If the intent is to add or modify a few individual users, use the A or M
transaction followed by the template data for the user. Do not include the T
transaction that indicates creation of a new template.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A T record in the text file means Create the Following Template file when import
is executed. For example:

   T PROFS:VMGate/Node

   Location:~20~20~A~~ Department:~20~20~A~~ System Name:~20~20~A~~

An update import file generally will contain A, M, D, or R type of records for
external postoffices and gateways. A T record is used if a full-refresh (delete
existing information and re-add) is needed on an existing node or when
introducing new node(s).

For PROFS users, the user and template information is stored at the node level.
For each node, information exists in three files:

1. <hexid>.usr (for users)

2. <hexid>.inf (for template information)

3. <hexid>.tpl (for the template)
