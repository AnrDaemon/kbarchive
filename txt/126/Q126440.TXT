The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a

SUMMARY
=======

FoxPro for Macintosh will automatically store temporary files on the drive used
to boot the Macintosh.

If no corresponding entries are found in the CONFIG.FPM file, FoxPro will create
a folder on the boot drive named Temporary Items. Temporary files will be stored
in this folder. This occurs whether you install a full copy of FoxPro on the
local hard drive or perform a network installation from a shared hard drive.

To redirect temporary files from the default installation, place the following
entries in the CONFIG.FPM file, and restart the Macintosh:

      TMPFILES=<drive:folder>
      EDITWORK=<drive:folder>
      SORTWORK=<drive:folder>
      PROGWORK=<drive:folder>

For more information on configuring FoxPro, refer to the Installation and
Configuration Guide.
