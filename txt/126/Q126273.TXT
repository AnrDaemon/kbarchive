TITLE   :PRB: Columns Missing in .DBF File Created in Microsoft Excel
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.6a,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you save a spreadsheet as type "DBF3" in Microsoft Excel, some of the
columns are missing when you open the file in FoxPro.

CAUSE
=====

The field name for one or more columns contains invalid characters. FoxPro is
unable to read the Excel column that contains an invalid field name, or any
column following the invalid name.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the column heading to a valid FoxPro field name. A valid field name can
contain up to 10 letters, digits, or underscores, and it must begin with a
letter or an underscore.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 (or higer) for
   Macintosh.

2. In the first row of the spreadsheet, place the following information:

   Column A - CNO
   Column B - Company
   Column C - State
   Column D - <CredLimit
   Column E - Phone

3. Fill cells A2 through E4 with any data. Highlight the entire range A1 through
   E4, and name the range "database." The steps to do this will depend on the
   Excel version. In Excel version 5.0, for example, name the range by choosing
   Name from the Insert menu, selecting Define, and typing "database" in the
   Define Name dialog box below the Names in Workbook: prompt. The shortcut key
   to invoke the Define Name dialog is Command + L.

4. Choose Save As from the File menu, and save the file as TEST.DBF with a DBF3
   file format. The actual steps will depend on the Excel version.

5. Close Excel. Launch FoxPro, and issue these commands:

      USE <folder name>test.dbf
      BROWSE
