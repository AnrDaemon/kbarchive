SUMMARY
=======

The Help file for the ODBC version 2.0 Desktop Drivers mentions that the
Microsoft Access driver accepts the keywords CREATE_DB, REPAIR_DB, and
COMPACT_DB on the lpszAttributes parameter, but gives no details on their
syntax.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SQLConfigDataSource lpszAttributes keywords CREATE_DB, REPAIR_DB, and
COMPACT_DB cannot be used in conjunction with other keywords. If you want your
programs to create a datasource and also create a new .MDB file for that
datasource, you must do this in a two stage process. You must create the
datasource on one call to SQLConfigDataSource, and create the new .MDB file on a
separate call to SQLConfigDataSource.

The syntax for these keywords are:

      CREATE_DB=<path name> <sort order>
      REPAIR_DB=<path name>
      COMPACT_DB=<source path> <destination path> <sort order>

<path name> is the fully qualified path name to the .MDB file to be created
or repaired. <source path> is the fully qualified path name to the .MDB
file to be compacted. <destination path> is the fully qualified path name
of the file after it has been compacted. <sort order> is one of the
following keywords:

   General, Traditional Spanish, Dutch, Swedish/Finnish, Norwegian/Danish,
   Icelandic, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek

NOTE: The General sort order covers English, French, German, Portuguese, and
Italian.

Depending on the version of the Microsoft Jet Engine used by the Microsoft Access
ODBC driver the following keywords may also be available:

   

   CREATE_DBV2=<path name> <sort order> (to create version 2 Jet engine mdb file, Access 2, 16bit)

   CREATE_DBV3=<path name> <sort order> (to create version 3 Jet engine mdb file, Access 95, Access 97)

   CREATE_DBV4=<path name> <sort order> (to create version 4 Jet engine mdb file, Access 2000)

For additional information on these and other keywords, see the MSDN or the
Microsoft Press book, Microsoft Jet Database Engine Programmer's Guide.

NOTE: Some versions of the documentation incorrectly spell CREATE_DBV2 and are
missing descriptions for CREATE_DBV3 and CREATE_DBV4.

With CREATE_DB, the file named in <path name> must not exist at the time
SQLCOnfigDataSource is called.

With REPAIR_DB, the file named in <path name> must be a valid .MDB file.

With COMPACT_DB, the file named in <source path> must be a valid .MDB file.
<destination path> can point to the same file as <source path>, in
which case the file will be compacted into the same location. If <destination
path> names a different file than <source path>, the file named as the
<destination path> must not exist at the time SQLConfigDataSource is
called.

For example, the following code segment would create a .MDB file, repair it,
compress it to a second file, compress it in the same location, and then create
a datasource for it.

      void Config_Sample(void)
      {
                RETCODE retcode;
                int     subscrp;
        extern  HWND    hWnd;      /* Main window handle. */ 

        UCHAR szDriver[] = "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)";
        UCHAR *szAttributes2[] =
        // Create the original .mdb file.
        {"CREATE_DB=c:\\odbcsdk\\smpldata\\access\\general.mdb General\0\0",

        // Issue a REPAIR_DB on the created file.
        "REPAIR_DB=c:\\odbcsdk\\smpldata\\access\\general.mdb\0\0",

        // Compact the file into a new location.
        "COMPACT_DB=c:\\odbcsdk\\smpldata\\access\\general.mdb "
          "c:\\odbcsdk\\smpldata\\access\\general2.mdb General\0\0",

        // Compact the file onto itself.
        "COMPACT_DB=c:\\odbcsdk\\smpldata\\access\\general.mdb "
          "c:\\odbcsdk\\smpldata\\access\\general.mdb General\0\0",

        // Create a datasource for the first .mdb file created.
        "DSN=albacc\0FIL=MS Access\0JetIniPath=odbcddp.ini\0"
        "DBQ=c:\\odbcsdk\\smpldata\\access\\general.mdb\0"
        "DefaultDir=c:\\odbcsdk\\smpldata\\access\0\0"};

        for (subscrp = 0;
             subscrp <= ((sizeof szAttributes2 / sizeof(UCHAR *)) - 1);
              subscrp++)
        {
          retcode = SQLConfigDataSource(hWnd,
                                        ODBC_ADD_DSN,
                                        szDriver,
                                        szAttributes2[subscrp]);
          if (retcode != TRUE)
            handle_error(retcode);
        }
        return;
      }
