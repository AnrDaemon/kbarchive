KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have installed multimedia software or a sound board, using CHR(7) to ring
the bell may no longer work in FoxPro. The bell is silent whether you SET BELL
TO a wave file, or to the normal system bell.

CAUSE
=====

The multimedia software installed TIMER.DRV as a device driver in the [DEVICE]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file. TIMER.DRV is causing a conflict with FoxPro and
the bell is not ringing.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two possible resolutions to the problem:

1. Remove TIMER.DRV by choosing the Control Panel Drivers icon, highlighting the
   TIMER.DRV entry, and clicking the Remove push button.

2. Use the steps outlined in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
