SYMPTOMS

   Unable to initialize server services.

Followed by the error message

   You cannot run this application in a window or in the background

or:

   You cannot run this application while other high-resolution applications are
   running fullscreen. The application will be suspended until a low-resolution

MSAV, boot your computer from a clean floppy disk (such as the MS-DOS Setup
disk) and then type MSAV at the command prompt.
