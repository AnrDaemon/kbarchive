======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you receive the
following error message:

   System in protected mode. System halted

CAUSE
=====

A required entry for the Mylex Disk Array controller card (DAC960) may be
missing from the CONFIG.SYS file. The DAC960 requires the DACDRVR.SYS driver
file to be loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify the DACDRVR.SYS driver file in the CONFIG.SYS file, or contact Mylex to
receive an updated DACDRVR.SYS driver file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The BIOS on the DAC960 can be used only in real-mode operating systems and is
incompatible with some memory managers. To use the DAC960 with Windows or
Windows for Workgroups or with a memory manager, the DACDRVR.SYS driver file
must be loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file. According to Mylex, the DACDRVR.SYS
driver file should be the first device loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file.

For additional information, please contact Mylex Technical Support at (800)
776-9539.
