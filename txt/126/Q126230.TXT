PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create users within the Mail Administrator program, and those users
have full names that begin with an extended character (for example, a character
in the Swedish alphabet), the sort order in the address list will be incorrect
when you view the list from Local Admin, Modify or from the mail client. After
you run the RESORT -S -L (Scandinavian sort order) command, the client will then
display the correct sort order; however, but the Mail Administrator program
continues to display the users in the wrong order. This problem occurs on a
version 3.2 English-language Mail for PC Networks server or on a Mail for PC
Networks server that has been updated from English to Swedish.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the C850SORT.GLB file from a version 3.2 Swedish-language Mail for PC
Networks server.
