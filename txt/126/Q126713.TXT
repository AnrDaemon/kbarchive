======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

A user with a valid user name and domain name, who also has the right to log on
locally to a Windows NT computer, can have the system run a program on the local
computer in a heightened security context.

NOTE: The Guest account does not have access to modify the registry. By default,
Windows NT domain controllers only permit administrators to log on and therefore
are not vulnerable.

CAUSE
=====

When a properly authenticated user logs on locally to a Windows NT computer,
that user becomes a member of the "Everyone" group. The default permission on
the keys cited below allow members of the "Everyone" group special access, which
includes the right to Set Values or Create Subkeys. This allows members of the
"Everyone" group to create an entry under the Run and RunOnce keys that contains
the name of a program to run when the computer starts. The Uninstall key defines
the programs to run when you remove an application.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

Because there is a potential for the abuse of this level of rights, some
organizations may want to reset the permissions, as described below in the
Resolution section. A user must be logged on locally in order to change these
keys. They can be changed remotely by properly authenticated and privileged
administrators.

RESOLUTION
==========

Resetting the permissions for these three registry subkeys to READ resolves this
issue.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Perform the following steps to reset the permissions:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Perform the following steps on each of the registry keys identified above:

   a. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

   b. Click "Replace Permissions on Existing Subkeys" so that it is selected.

   c. Click Everyone, change the Type Of Access to Read, and then click OK.

3. Exit Registry Editor.
