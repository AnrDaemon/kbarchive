-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, there are times when it
may become necessary to create a new mail message file (MMF) for a specific
user, such as if a corrupt MMF is suspected.

The MMF can be stored either on the postoffice or the local workstation. This
article details steps for recreating a locally stored MMF.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not know where the MMF is currently being stored, start Mail using the
Windows client. From the Mail menu, choose Options. Then select Server.

If the Storage location is Postoffice, then select the Local button, and provide
a file name.

NOTE: The Personal Address Book (PAB) and any personal groups created by the user
will be lost when you perform process below. For information on how to retain
the PAB, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Steps for Creating a New MMF
----------------------------

1. From the File menu, choose Export Folder... You can either accept the default
   Export file name or create a new export file. The first time you use a given
   export file, you will be prompted by the Mail system to create it.

2. Decide if you want to copy or move the folders from the existing MMF.

3. Once the export is complete, Exit & Sign Out of Mail.

4. From File Manager, rename the export MMF.

5. Start Mail. You will be prompted for a user name and password. You will see
   the following message:

   Your message file could not be found.

   Click OK. Select the New button. You will receive the following warning:

   The existence of multiple message files can result in a loss of database
   integrity. Delete all other message files. Your message file can be found in
   <path>.

6. Once Mail has started and created the new MMF, from the File menu, choose
   Import Folder to import the messages from the export file.

7. If you need to return the MMF to the postoffice, from the Mail menu, choose
   Options. Select the Server button and move the MMF back to the postoffice.
