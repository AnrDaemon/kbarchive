SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to pass parameters to a form built with the Form
Designer. Parameters are passed to either the Init or the Load method of a form
or form set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To pass a parameter to a form built with the Form Designer, add a WITH statement
to the DO FORM command. For example:

      DO FORM frmtest WITH cLastname

The value of the WindowType property determines if a parameter is received by
either the Load or the Init method of a Form.

WindowType = 1 or WindowType= 0
-------------------------------

Parameters are passed to the Init of the form or the form set. The parameter is
visible to the Init and all of the methods that the Init calls. Once the method
associated with the Init event is completed, the variable is released. The
parameter is private.

To scope a parameter to a form, add a property at the form level and assign the
value of the parameter to the member variable.

For more information on how to add a property to a form, refer to the creating
New Properties and Methods paragraph in the Creating Forms chapter of the
Developer's Guide. For additional information about the syntax associated with
passing parameter, refer to the Managing Forms paragraph in the Creating Forms
chapter of the Developer's Guide.


WindowType = 2 or WindowType= 3
-------------------------------

These settings are available to form sets only. A page frame is necessary to
access the WindowType values of 2-READ or 3-READ MODAL. This functionality
emulates a READ, and has been implemented for backwards compatibility. When the
WindowType = 2 or WindowType = 3, the parameters are received by the LOAD method
of the form set. They are scoped to the form set.
