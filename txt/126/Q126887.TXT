SUMMARY
=======

The Simple Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) function MAPIReadMail,
which is included with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, has the ability to access
attachment files associated with a given message found in Microsoft Mail for
Windows Inbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When called, the MAPIReadMail function will automatically save the attachment to
a temporary file. The temporary file is a direct copy and is not encrypted.
However, the attachment file will not be written to disk if the
MAPI_SUPPRESS_ATTACH or MAPI_ENVELOPE_ONLY flag is used in the call to
MAPIReadMail.

The temporary attachment file is copied to the TEMP directory as defined by the
operating system (per the SET TEMP= command). The file will use the original
attachment file name, date, and time.

If multiple MAPIReadMail calls are made to the same message containing an
attachment, or the same file name already exists in the TEMP directory, the
temporary file name will be altered. This is done so that the original file is
not overwritten. The file naming scheme is to add a number to the end of the
original file name. For example, an attachment called MYFILE.TXT, already
residing in the TEMP directory, will be created as MYFILE1.TXT. Subsequent calls
to MAPIReadMail will produce MYFILE2.TXT, MYFILE3.TXT, and so on. The caller of
MAPIReadMail is responsible for deleting these files.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.20 attachments
