SUMMARY
=======

TCP/IP is a protocol suite containing two protocols: Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).

TCP is a connection oriented protocol that compensates for the underlying
network's lack of reliability. It ensures the correct sequence of packets and
provides end-to-end acknowledgment.

IP is a connectionless protocol. Each packet contains routing information that
allows the network nodes to route the packet toward its destination. The nodes
themselves do not try to understand the packet data.

TCP functionality is comparable with that of the Open Systems Interconnection's
(OSI's) transport service class 4; that is, TP4.

REFERENCES
==========

TCP is specified in RFC-793.

IP is specified in RFC-791.
