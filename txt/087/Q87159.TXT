-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for the Macintosh allows for local folder storage
as well as server folder storage. The local folder information and contents are
stored in a single data file using the user name as the title. This file is
stored in the MS Mail Local Folder, which is kept within the Preferences
folder.

The local cache file, which is also kept in the Preferences folder, keeps track
of the last open folder. The default open folder for offline use is the last
open folder, if it is local. Then it will be the Outbox, if it exists, and if
there is no Outbox, the default open folder will be the first alphabetical local
folder. If the last open folder is the Outbox, and Mail is started online, then
the open folder will be the Mailbox; Mail never defaults to the Outbox while
offline.
