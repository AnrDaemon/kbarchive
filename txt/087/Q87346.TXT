TITLE   :FIX: PR1428 Illegal Breakpoint Error Profiling P-code
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Source Profiler for OS/2, version 1.2 
 - Microsoft Source Profiler for MS-DOS, version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The information in this article is included in the documentation starting
with Visual C++ 5.0. Look there for future revisions.

SYMPTOMS
========

Running the Microsoft Source Profiler PROFILE command in the MS-DOS or Microsoft
Windows operating system on an application that contains P-code causes the
following error:

   PROFILE: fatal error PR1428: A user-defined breakpoint was found at location

CAUSE
=====

The fatal error PR1428 is generated because the P-code breakpoint instruction is
implemented as Interrupt 03h, which cannot be profiled (as stated on pages 73
and 75 of the Source Profiler "User's Guide" for version 1.2). Using Interrupt
03h in an application conflicts with the way that the Source Profile itself uses
Interrupt 03h.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this fatal error, profile the application after removing all the P-
code from the profiled region.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Source Profiler
version 1.2 for MS-DOS and Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
Source Profiler version 1.3.
