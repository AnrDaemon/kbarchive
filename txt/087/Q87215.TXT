The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The host side of the gateway must always be started first, in order for HostDisp
(or VMGATE) to operate correctly.

Once you start the host side of the gateway, "PROFS:IDLE" or "PROFS:READY"
appears on the screen. HostDisp relies on this prompt when it "polls" the host
to check if there is mail to download. If HostDisp does not see one of these two
prompts, it exits to MS-DOS without attempting to upload or download any mail.

For detailed instructions on how to start each side of the gateway, consult the
"Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision LAN Administrator's
Guide."
