The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

If you have trouble starting Windows 3.1 in standard or 386 enhanced mode on a
PS/2, you may need to remove the device= line for XGAAIDOS.SYS from the
CONFIG.SYS file.

According to the Windows 3.1 SETUP.TXT file, Windows will run correctly in
standard mode even if XGAAIDOS.SYS is loaded. This may not be true.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the device=xgaaidos.sys line from the
CONFIG.SYS file and call IBM to obtain an updated version of XGAAIDOS.SYS.
According to IBM, this problem will not occur if you are using version 1.2 of
the driver.
