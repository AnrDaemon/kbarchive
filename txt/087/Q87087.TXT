The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you run Novell LAN WorkPlace for DOS version 4.01 from Windows, you receive
one or more general protection (GP) faults.

MORE INFORMATION
================

GP Fault 1
----------

When you start the Novell FileExpress, you receive a GP fault if the virtual
device driver VTCPIP.386 is not installed in the SYSTEM.INI file and the Windows
SYSTEM subdirectory:

   FILEXPRS caused an unknown fault in WLIBSOCK.DLL

FileExpress is a Windows-based application that uses the LAN WorkPlace for DOS
files to communicate across the network to UNIX servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the steps below to install VTCPIP.386.

1. Copy the file VTCPIP.386 to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

2. Edit the [386Enh] section in the SYSTEM.INI file with an ASCII text editor
   and add the following line:

   device=VTCPIP.386

GP Fault 2
----------

When you try to close FileExpress, you receive a GP fault.

Workaround
----------

Select a file on the REMOTE display before you try to close FileExpress. (The
REMOTE display is the window that contains the list of files located on the
remote server.)

GP Fault 3
----------

When you are using LAN WorkPlace version 2.0 in conjunction with Oracle 7 SQLNET
server, the following error may be displayed:

   Nettest has caused a general protection fault in module WLIBSOCK.DLL

To work around this problem, install VTCPIP.386 using the "Steps to Install
VTCPIP.386" instructions above.
