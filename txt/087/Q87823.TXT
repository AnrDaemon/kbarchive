SYMPTOMS
========

Wired for Sound Pro may cause your computer to stop responding (hang) when you
exit Windows 3.1.

CAUSE
=====

If the computer hangs when you exit Windows or you hear a conflict between two
sounds when a system event occurs, check to see if these problems occur when
Wired for Sound Pro is not loaded. Wired for Sound Pro may be conflicting with
Windows Event sounds assigned in the Control Panel Sounds option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, either disable the Windows Event sounds or disable Wired
for Sound Pro.

To disable the Windows Event sounds, proceed as follows:

1. From Control Panel choose the Sound icon.

2. Select the first system event from the Events list box and then choose
   <None> from the Files menu. Repeat this step for each of the events
   listed in the Event list box.

3. Choose the OK button.

4. Exit and restart Windows so your changes can take effect.
