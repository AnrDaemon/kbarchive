SUMMARY
=======

An .ATT file is the method by which the Microsoft Mail system stores attachment
files. The .ATT files are accessed by using pointers previously stored in an
.MAI file. An attachment file can be any valid MS-DOS file of any size.

A single .MAI file can reference several attachments; however, a single
attachment file cannot be referenced more than once. Attachment files are fully
encrypted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below is a brief description of the mail message fields.

A mail file is composed of fields. Each field is composed of a field type, field
length, and data. Fields can be either as specified in FIPS PUB 98 or
vendor-defined fields. A vendor-defined field is a field that can be defined for
your own purposes. The Mail system uses several vendor-defined fields.

The following table specifies the fields that a mail message is composed of and
the order that these fields generally appear in a mail message.
