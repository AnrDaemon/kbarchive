TITLE   :PRB: Changing Default Drive in FoxBASE+ Fox Central
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fox Miscellaneous Products
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.17
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.17 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When FoxBASE+ is running on a network, changing the default drive on a network
using the Select command in FoxCentral causes an "Error 31 Subscript Out of
Bounds" error message.

CAUSE
=====

Older versions of FoxCentral store the directory listing in an array, which is
limited to 128 elements in FoxBASE+. If the network drive has more than 128
directories, FoxCentral exceeds the array limit.

RESOLUTION
==========

This latest version of the FoxCentral application does not store the directory
listing in an array. The latest version of the CENTRAL.FOX file is dated March
20, 1992. To avoid this situation with an older copy of FoxCentral, use the SET
DEFAULT TO command to change the default drive from the FoxBASE+ command line.
For more information on the syntax to change the default directory, see the
FoxBASE+ "Commands & Functions" and/or "User's Guide" manual.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 Novell Fox Base plus
