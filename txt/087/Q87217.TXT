SUMMARY
=======

The HostDisp (or VMGATE) program is written so that it can be run without any
command-line options. However, some options are usually necessary in most
environments. These options are as follows:

    Option   Description
   ------   -----------

   -C       Necessary if you want the program to run in color.

   -E       Necessary if you want to have error messages sent to a
            specific mailbox on the local-area network (LAN).

   -F       Necessary if you do not have the directory containing the
            3270 file transfer programs in the MS-DOS path of the
            gateway PC.

   -L       Required if you want to create a log file for the gateway
            program's activities.

   -X       Necessary if you want the gateway PC to use NetBIOS to
            provide mail system users with instant notification of new
            mail.
