The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

If you are creating batch programs, you might find it useful to associate the
.BAT extension with a text editor (for example, MS-DOS Editor). So when you
double-click on a .BAT file in an MS-DOS Shell file list, Editor will run and
load that batch file.

However, if you associate a program with an .EXE, .COM, or .BAT extension, you
will be unable to run program files that have the associated extension by
double-clicking on the file in Shell's file list or by selecting the file and
choosing Open from the File menu.

To run a program file that has an associated extension, create a program item to
start the program file. If you are using MS-DOS version 5.0 or 6.0, you can also
use the Run command from the File menu.

If you associate a program with a .BAT extension, you will be unable to run a
batch file by double-clicking on it in the file list or by selecting the file
and choosing Open from the File menu. To run a program file with a .BAT
extension, create a program item for the program.

-------------------------

MS-DOS 5.0 or 6.0 Shell allows you to associate a .EXE, .COM, or .BAT extension

unable to run program files that have the associated extension by
double-clicking on the file in the file list or by selecting the file and
choosing Open from the File menu. To run a program file that has an associated
extension, use the Run option from the File menu or create a program item for
the program.
