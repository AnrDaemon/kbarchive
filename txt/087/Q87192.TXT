 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order to install the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision,
you must have the Microsoft Mail Server version 2.1 or later installed on your
local area network (LAN).

The gateway also requires a dedicated IBM-compatible PC/XT/AT with 640K of RAM.
This gateway PC will use a 3270 emulation program to communicate with the VM
side of the gateway. For version 3.0 of the gateway, the 3270 card installed in
the gateway PC should support one of these 3270 APIs:

   IBM High Level
   IBM Low Level
   DCA CUT-mode
   DCA non-CUT (DFT)
   Novell NetWare 3270
   Microsoft Comm Server 1.1, with the DCA-DFT emulation API
