TITLE   :Crash or Inappropriate Sounds Occur with Sound Blaster and 486

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MS-DOS-based applications that use the Sound Blaster family of cards may crash
or produce inappropriate sounds when used with Windows version 3.1 on some 386DX
and 486 machines.

CAUSE
=====

Creative Labs does not recommend running MS-DOS-based applications that use the
Sound Blaster cards from within Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

You may be able to work around this problem in the following ways:

 - Turn off the turbo button on the 486.

 - Set the DMABufferSize to 64 in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

 - Set the data bus speed of the 486 to 8 MHz.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem apparently occurs because data is being delivered too quickly to the
Sound Blaster cards. Turning off the turbo button slows down the data transfer
rates and, thus, may solve the problem.

Setting DMABufferSize to 64 reserves more space for the DMA channel to perform
its buffering function and, thus, allows room for the increased data.

Another possible solution is to check the bus speed setting in the CMOS setup. If
it is higher than 8 MHz, you may need to reduce it to 8 MHz. The bus speed of
some 486 machines may be set as high as 10 MHz. Slowing this down may alleviate
the transfer speed problem.
