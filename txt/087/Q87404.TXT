SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail system maintains unique tuple identifiers (tids) in several
file record structures. These tuple identifiers are used to guarantee the
authenticity of each user's name.

For example, if John Smith has the mailbox name JohnS and eventually gets
replaced with a new user named JohnS, the tuple identifier gets changed with the
deletion and re-creation of the mailbox name. Any users who had the old JohnS in
their Personal Address List would no longer have a valid address definition
because the tuple identifiers (or "tids") would not match.
