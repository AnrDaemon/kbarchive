-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you select a two-dimensional (non-line) object in Microsoft PowerPoint, the
selected object is surrounded by a fuzzy gray rectangle. This is called a
selection box. The corners of the selection box are resize handles. You can use
these handles to stretch, shrink, or reproportion the object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the selected object is not a PowerPoint object or group, it will not be
surrounded by a selection box. This is a visual indication that the object is
not a PowerPoint object or group.

Objects that are not PowerPoint objects or groups include the following:

 - Embedded or linked objects (such as charts, movies, and so on)


 - Imported graphics (using the Insert Picture, Paste, or Paste Special
   commands)

An item created with the tools on the tool palette (with the exception of
Microsoft Graph objects) is a PowerPoint object. Also, any collection of objects
that has been grouped together using the Group command is considered a
PowerPoint group, and will be surrounded by a selection box.
