The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an application for the Microsoft Windows environment sends the
QUERYESCSUPPORT printer escape to the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet (HPPCL)
printer driver to determine whether the SETABORTPROC escape is supported, the
Escape function returns the value 0 (zero), indicating that the escape is not
supported. However, an application can successfully send the SETABORTPROC escape
to the HPPCL printer driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with version 31.3.89 of the HPPCL
printer driver distributed with Windows version 3.1.
