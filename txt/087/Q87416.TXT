SUMMARY
=======

An MBG file is used to store all incoming or outgoing mail.

There are two types of incoming mailbag files. All local postoffice users will
have a unique mailbag that are of the form 0nnnnnnn.MBG. Mail destined for the
postoffice that arrives from outside the postoffice is stored temporarily in a
file called INQUEUE3.MBG.

Mail that arrives in the INQUEUE3.MBG file will either be distributed to a local
user mailbag or forwarded to another outgoing mailbag via the Mailer process.

Outgoing mailbags are one of the following type: external postoffice, FFAPI
postoffice, or gateway. The contents of these mailbags can be manipulated by
using the Admin program's Queue function.

The version 3.0 Mail postoffice contains a special mailbag, the SYSTEM.MBG
mailbag. Mail addressed to network/postoffice/$system will be put here. It is
currently used for directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) mail; however, in future
versions may also be used for other system mail functions
