SUMMARY
=======

If a screensaver is started when Microsoft Bookshelf 1992 Edition is playing an
animation, the animation will stop. If the animation is a narrated animation,
the animation controller will be reset to ensure proper timing and
synchronization. This is by design.

Additional query words: 1.00 screensaver viewer 1.0 usage
