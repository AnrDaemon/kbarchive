MORE INFORMATION
================

QEMM 5.11 May Conflict with Intellifont
---------------------------------------

According to HP technical support, HP Intellifont for Windows 3.0 and QEMM386
5.11 may produce unpredictable results if they are used together with Windows.

A possible workaround suggested by HP is to delete the phrase "I=f100-f7ff" from
the Device= line containing the QEMM386 manager in the CONFIG.SYS file.

Replacing the QEMM386 manager with the HIMEM.SYS driver supplied with Windows 3.0
will also eliminate the problem until a different solution can be provided by
the product vendors.

Adobe Type Manager and Intellifont Cause UAE when Both Are Active
-----------------------------------------------------------------

According to HP technical support, HP Intellifont for Windows 3.0 and ATM should
work together as long as the cache amount set in ATM is not greatly increased
over the recommended 96K default. The more the cache is increased, the greater
the chance of a UAE occurring in Windows 3.0.

End-of-File Marker Causes Intellifont UAE
-----------------------------------------

When you edit plain text files in Word for Windows or other applications that
display control characters, and use Hewlett-Packard (HP) Intellifont for
Windows, an end-of-file (EOF) marker in the file may cause garbage characters or
an Unrecoverable Application Error (UAE). This is a limitation of Intellifont.
For more information, please contact HP technical support.

To work around this problem, disable Intellifont for Windows to edit plain text
files that contain an EOF marker, or use a plain text editor (such as Notepad)
that does not display control characters.

The Intellifont product included here is manufactured by HP, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
