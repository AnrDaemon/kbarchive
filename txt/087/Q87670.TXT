----------------------

An ELSE or ENDIF statement does not have a corresponding IF statement.

Illegal macro name

The length of a macro name exceeds the maximum allowed length (10 characters).

Illegal macro substitution

An application contains a macro substitution that uses a non- character-string
memory variable.

Illegal seek offset

An error has caused FoxBASE+ to attempt to position before the beginning of a
file.

Index does not match database
-----------------------------

The index expression for the current index uses variables which are not contained
within the current database.

Index expression too big
------------------------

The index expression for an index exceeds the maximum allowed key length (150
characters).

Index file is corrupt
---------------------

A damaged structure within an index file is detected.

Internal consistency error
--------------------------

An internal FoxBASE+ table has been corrupted.

Invalid argument
----------------

An argument passed to a function is not of the correct type.

Invalid characters in load file
-------------------------------

(MS-DOS only) An invalid character has been detected in a LOAD file where a digit
from 0 to 9 or a character from A to F was expected.

Invalid file descriptor
-----------------------

Due to an internal error, FoxBASE+ has attempted to read or write with a damaged
file descriptor.

Invalid key length
------------------

An invalid index key length has been specified. The length of a key for an index
must be between 0 and 100 characters.

Invalid load format
-------------------

(MS-DOS only) A LOAD file contains a line which does not match the standard load
format.

Key expression too long

The length of an expression exceeds the maximum index key length (150
characters).

Key too big
-----------

The length of an index key exceeds the maximum index key length (100
characters).

-------------

The length of a text line exceeds the maximum allowed length (254 characters).

-------------------------

A CASE, ENDCASE or OTHERWISE statement does not have a corresponding DO CASE
statement.

Missing (

A function name is missing a left parenthesis.

Missing )
---------

A function name is missing a right parenthesis. Either the current line contains
a left parenthesis which has not been matched or the function contains too many
arguments which prevents the right parenthesis from being detected.

Missing ,
---------

FoxBASE+ did not detect a comma when one was expected. This error is usually
caused through failure to include the proper number of arguments in a call to a
function.

Missing/invalid terminal config. file
-------------------------------------

(MS-DOS only) FoxBASE+ cannot find the specified terminal configuration file, or
the file contains invalid data.

Mixed mode expression
---------------------

The data type of the expression on the left side of an operator does not match
the data type of the expression on the right side. An example of this error
would be to compare a number to a string.
