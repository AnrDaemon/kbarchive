-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The VESA Local Bus Diamond Stealth video card may conflict with other hardware
devices because of the hardware I/O address or IRQ.

NOTE: This information may also apply to other video cards using the S3 video
chip set, such as the Orchid Fahrenheit card, or other graphics coprocessor
cards, such as the ATI Ultra series.

Hardware I/O Address
--------------------

The Diamond Stealth S3-based video card has a hardware I/O address of 02E8, which
cannot be changed. This may cause a conflict with other hardware devices using
this same address. By default, many serial cards and internal modems use this
address for COM4. Some ARCnet cards also use this address.

 - If there is a conflict, it may result in garbled TrueType font output when
   printing.

 - If the conflict is with a network card, then you may not be able to run in
   386 enhanced mode.

To correct these problems, change the I/O address of the device conflicting with
the Stealth video card.

Hardware IRQ
------------

By default, the Diamond Stealth comes configured to use IRQ2. This is the
cascading IRQ to the second Intel 8259 Programmable Interrupt Chip (PIC).

 - If another device is also using this IRQ, you may receive garbled TrueType
   fonts when printing.

 - If there is a conflict, you may be prevented from running in 386 enhanced
   mode in Windows 3.0 and 3.1.

 - If there is no conflict, you still may not be able to run in 386 enhanced
   mode from Windows 3.0.

To correct this problem, you can disable the Stealth's use of IRQ2 by removing a
jumper from the video card. Please refer to your Diamond Stealth user's guide
for the procedure.
