The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Terminal version 3.0 or 3.1 in VT100 terminal emulation to connect
to a VAX, the BACKSPACE key does not erase previously typed characters (that is,
it does not move the cursor back one space, and it does not remove the previous
character.)

RESOLUTION
==========

The correct way to backspace in Terminal when connected to a VAX is to press the
CTRL+H key combination. The function of the BACKSPACE key varies with the host
environment.
