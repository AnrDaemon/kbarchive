======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Comm Server version 1.1 with the DCA-DFT emulation API works with all
versions of the Microsoft Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you instal the gateway, the Install program prompts for the type of 3270
emulation program being used. Select option 3 (for DCA-nonCUT or DCA-DFT). This
copies the correct version of the HostDisp (or VMGATE) program to the
executables directory.

Installing Comm Server on the gateway PC is done separately, by following the
instructions supplied with the Comm Server product. Below is a sample batch
file, showing how Comm Server is loaded on a typical gateway PC. This batch file
assumes that LAN Manager is already loaded, and the workstation is logged into
the network.

   SET PATH=C:\COMMSRV\RBIN;%path%

   @REM DO NOT DELETE -- Comm Server setup begins mark
   lh SHARE
   lh c:\COMMSRV\DEV\COMNDIS 5
   lh c:\COMMSRV\RBIN\REMNAP \\comsvr
   @REM DO NOT DELETE -- Comm Server setup ends mark

   c:\commsrv\rbin\dos3270m

In the above batch file, the gateway PC is connecting to a server called
"\\comsvr".
