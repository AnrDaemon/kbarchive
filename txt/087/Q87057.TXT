 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Mail being sent from MCI to a downstream postoffice is first picked up by the
MCI gateway. The gateway looks at the TO: address of the mail message: if the
mail is going to a downstream postoffice, the gateway puts the mail in that
postoffice's queue, along with any other local mail going to the downstream
postoffice.

The External program picks up mail items from the queue and transmits them to the
downstream postoffice.
