-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To start the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, ensure that the gateway machine is
logged onto the network you are using (for example, Microsoft LAN Manager or
Novell NetWare), and ensure that a drive is mapped to the mail database
directory for the "Gateway Postoffice" and a search mapping or path is available
to the mail executable's directory.

To start up the gateway (assuming the M drive is mapped to the mail database
directory), use the following command:

   " SMTPGATE " (without the quotation marks)

If the mail database directory is mapped to any drive other than M, you must
specify the drive to be used as follows:

   " SMTPGATE -DP " (without the quotation marks)

In this example, the drive letter assigned to the mail database directory is P.
The -D indicates that the letter following it is the assigned drive letter for
the mail database.
