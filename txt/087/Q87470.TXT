The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks server software allows
version 3.0 workstations to access regular mail services. When a version 3.0
client accesses a version 3.1 server, certain resources that are offered by the
server become available to the client. Most of these differences are aesthetic;
however, a few are functional. The enhancements available to a version 3.0
client are listed below.

 - New icons appear in the message summary screen, the Personal Group window,
   and the Preferences window. These icons are in black and white, where the
   version 3.1 client shows the same icons in color.

 - The message summary screen can be resized.

 - During the creation of a new folder, the option to store date on the local
   workstation is viewable but not available.

Additional query words: 3.10
