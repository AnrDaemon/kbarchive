   (71,024 bytes in size) with Windows for Workgroups.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Set the Idle time on the printer port to 1 or 2, or change the device
   contention to NEVER WARN.

   -or-

 - Remove After Dark.

   -or-

 - Expand PRINTMAN.EX_ from the original Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11
   disks.

Workaround 1
------------

1. In the Main group, run Control Panel.

2. Choose the 386 Enhanced icon.

3. Select the correct printer port (for example, LPT1).

4. Change the Idle time from a default of 60 to 1 or 2.

5. Choose OK.

Workaround 2
