TITLE   :Registering Message Alias on RPL Workstation
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

When starting messenger on an MS-DOS RPL workstation, the user name is not
registered as a message alias. This can be confirmed by executing the NET NAME
command from the RPL workstation. Output shows only the workstation name as
being a registered name. This problem precludes the user from receiving net
popups addressed to the user. Messages sent to the workstation name are
correctly named.

RESOLUTION
==========

Increase the number of NetBIOS names the workstation can register. This can be
accomplished by increasing the NAMES parameter in the [NETBEUI] section in

      \LANMAN\RPL\BBLOCK\NETBEUI\<netcrd>\PROTOCOL.INI

(where <netcard> is the network interface card for the workstation in
question) from 5 to 6.


Additional query words: 2.10 RIPL messenger
