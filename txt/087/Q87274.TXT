SUMMARY
=======

The [RenFiles] section of the SETUP.INF file is used to rename files located in
the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory during the upgrade from Windows 3.0 to Windows
3.1. Renaming these files will prevent them from being overwritten during the
Windows 3.1 setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default [RenFiles] section of the SETUP.INF file on upgrade disk no. 1 is as
follows:

      [RenFiles]
         MIDIMAP.CFG,MIDIMAP.OLD
         ADLIB.DRV,MSADLIB.DRV

The first file in a line (for example, MIDIMAP.CFG) is the file that already
exists in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory; the second file (for example,
MIDIMAP.OLD) is the name that the first file will be renamed to.

NOTE: Files not in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory will not be renamed unless the
full path to that file is given.

To rename files in a directory other than the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, you
must first change directories. The change is made by using two periods (..) to
move down one directory or one period to move up a directory. Also, the change
must be in relation to the directory that you are currently logged to. For
example, if you want to rename the following files

      [drive:]\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\BLUE.TXT
      [drive:]\WINDOWS\WHITE.TXT
      [drive:]\WINDOWS\YELLOW.TXT
      [drive:]\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\GREEN.TXT
      [drive:]\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\BLACK.TXT

      ([drive:] refers to the drive where the Windows files are located)

add the following lines to the [RenFiles] section of the SETUP.INF,
respectively:

      [RenFiles]
      BLUE.TXT,RED.TXT
      ..\WHITE.TXT,PURPLE.TXT
      YELLOW.TXT,CYAN.TXT
      .\SYSTEM\GREEN.TXT,TAN.TXT
      BLACK.TXT,ORANGE.TXT
