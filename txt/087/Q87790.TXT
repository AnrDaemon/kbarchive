-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.1, 5.11, 5.13, 5.15, 5.2 
 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2, versions 5.1, 5.11, 5.13, 5.15 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

According to the printed and online documentation for versions of Microsoft LINK
earlier than version 5.3, the default setting for the /PACKC[ODE] linker option
switch is off. This statement is incorrect.

The documentation for LINK version 5.3 includes the following correct statement:

   Code-segment packing is on by default for segmented executable files and for
   DOS programs created with overlays or with the /TINY option.

The /NOPACKC[ODE] switch turns code-segment packing off.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To see how code packing changes the executable file, examine the map file that
LINK creates. In the two partial map files below, each logical segment has a
distinct physical segment address when the file is linked with /NOPACKCODE but
the logical segments share a physical segment when /PACKCODE is on (the default
behavior).

   0001:0000  0114CH      _TEXT
   0002:0000  00972H      MOD_TEXT      //  code packing off /NOPACKCODE
   0003:0000  0137DH      MOD2_TEXT
   0004:0000  0021EH      MOD3_TEXT

   Start      Length      Name
   0001:0000  00934H      _TEXT
   0001:0934  01354H      MOD_TEXT      // code packing on   (default)
   0001:1C88  00ADAH      MOD2_TEXT
   0001:2762  014ABH      MOD3_TEXT

The /PACKCODE switch is documented incorrectly in the following four locations:

 - Microsoft C "Reference" manual for version 6.0, page 31

 - Microsoft FORTRAN "Environment and Tools" manual for version 5.1, version 379

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) "Programmer's Guide" manual for version 6.0,
   page 354

 - Microsoft QuickC for Windows (QC/Win) "Toolkit" manual for version 1.0, page
   219
