SUMMARY
=======

When sending mail from Microsoft Mail to a host-based user, files can be
attached to a message in the same way as when sending to another local MS Mail
user. However, the recipient will receive one note and one file per attachment
in their reader list.

When an MS Mail user receives files from a host-based user, the message text and
each file arrive in the recipient's mailbox as a separate mail item.

When sending to another MS Mail user via the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS,
attached files are encapsulated so that the recipient cannot tell that the mail
item traveled through any gateways. This is known as HUB mail, and is documented
in the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision LAN Administrator's
Guide." In this case, one message with attachments arrives in the recipient's
mailbag.
