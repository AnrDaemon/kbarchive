TITLE   :FIX: CodeView 4.0 Does Not Step Over Embedded Int 3
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.05
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.05 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft CodeView version 4.0 will not step over an embedded Interrupt 3
instruction. Execution will also stop after pressing F5 for Go, and will not
pass this instruction.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can either step over the Int 3 by changing the value of the IP register, or
use the Assemble command to change the Int 3 instruction.

You can modify the IP register so it points to the instruction immediately after
the Int 3 by modifying the register directly in the register window, or by using
the Rip command.

You can change the Int 3 to a NOP instruction using the Assemble (a) command as
follows

   >a XXXX:XXX1
   >XXXX:XXX1 nop
   >XXXX:XXX2

where XXXX:XXX1 is the address where the Int 3 is located.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView versions 4.0, 4.01, and
4.05. This problem was corrected in CodeView version 4.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Int 3 is a special debugging interrupt. It is often put in code to create a
permanent, or hard breakpoint.

Additional query words: 4.00 4.10
