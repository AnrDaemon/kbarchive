SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, you can access commands quickly by using
gestures. These gestures are similar to shortcut keys, and can be used for
cutting, copying, pasting, and user-defined functions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some ideas of possible user-defined gestures are:

1. Inserting specific text (similar to a glossary entry) into a document.

2. Carrying out specific functions that you use frequently -- such as saving or
   printing a document.

To produce a gesture using Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, use your pen to
draw the appropriate symbol. Commands such as Cut, Copy Paste, and Undo use
common grammatical gestures, whereas user-defined gestures commonly use a letter
enclosed in a circle.

Gestures can be defined for use exclusively with one application or system-wide.
Multiple users can save specific configuration information that can be loaded
when that person is using the computer; however, this feature is not available
when creating user-defined gestures to carry out specific tasks.

User-defined gestures are controlled by the Gesture Manager, which is accessed
through the Pen Palette (PENPAL.EXE). The Gesture Manager allows you to assign a
gesture to either a series of keystrokes or to a string of text. PENPAL.EXE
should be loaded automatically every time you start Microsoft Windows for Pen
Computing.

User-defined gestures are saved in the PENWIN.INI file. Those gestures defined
for use system-wide are in a section titled [sysges] and those for specific
applications are in that application's title, for example [TERMINAL].
