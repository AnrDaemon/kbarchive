-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows for Pen Computing, the Rotate Screen Orientation function from
Control Panel controls only Windows or MS-DOS-based applications running in a
window.

Full-screen MS-DOS-based applications and the MS-DOS command prompt will not be
affected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To rotate an MS-DOS-based application, you must run the application in a
window.

MS-DOS-based applications can only be run in a window while Windows is in 386
enhanced mode.

If you are running a full-screen MS-DOS-based application and you want to run the
application in a window, press ALT+ENTER.

For more information on this procedure see pages 21-22 of the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide" for version 3.1.

To run an MS-DOS-based application in a window automatically when it is launched,
start the program using a program instruction (PIF) file. You may want to start
the MS-DOS-based application by writing a PIF file.

The Rotate Screen Orientation icon may be added to the Control Panel by the
Windows for Pen Computing extensions. Due to the variety of hardware offered by
Pen Computing equipment manufactures, you may want to customize the display
screen orientation by rotating it from landscape to portrait.

The Rotate Screen Orientation icon will appear in the Control Panel if the
CPROT.CPL file is recognized in the CONTROL.INI file. The default location
should be in the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. This is an extenuation to Windows
and therefore does not affect MS-DOS or the hardware.
