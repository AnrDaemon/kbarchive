SUMMARY
=======

Within the Admin program, you can define both direct and indirect gateways to
PROFS. Direct gateways are those that directly access your postoffice; indirect
gateways are connected to other "downstream" postoffices. Within the mail client
programs, both types of gateways appear in the PROFS address list, and are not
discernible from each other.

Normally, there is only one direct gateway installed at a postoffice; however,
there could be several indirect gateways defined. Mail addressed to users on any
of these indirect gateways is delivered to the host by means of the External
program and a downstream postoffice.
