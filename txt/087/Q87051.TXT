SUMMARY
=======

The workstation that runs the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI must be a dedicated
PC with a modem. The gateway transmits mail items between Microsoft Mail and
MCI.

The gateway picks up mail items from Microsoft Mail, dials MCI, logs in, and
passes the mail items to MCI. The gateway then downloads any mail waiting in its
MCI account, disconnects, and distributes the downloaded mail to the appropriate
Microsoft Mail users.
