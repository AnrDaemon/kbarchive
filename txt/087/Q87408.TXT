The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are two main consequences of not having a KEY file: the user will not be
able to read existing mail in the file and the file will not accept mail from
other programs.

When a Microsoft Mail client attempts to load the KEY file and it is not
available, the following error message is displayed:

   Error in mail header retrieval

The program will still function; however, the user will not be able to read his
or her mail messages.

Similarly, when another user attempts to send mail to that user ID, the following
message will appear:

   ERROR MAILING TO MAILBAG:

   Mailbag: 00000000
   Address: NETWORK/POSTOFFICE/Admin

   Press any key to continue...

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error messages will continue to be displayed until a valid KEY file is made
available. This usually involves restoring the file from a backup or freeing it
for use if it was locked open by another application or workstation.
