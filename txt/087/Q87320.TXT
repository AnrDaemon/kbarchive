SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows allows a maximum of 50 program items in a program group. In
addition, Windows 3.1 allows a maximum of 40 program groups in Program Manager.
In Windows 3.0 and 3.0a, there is no program group limit, other than the one
imposed by the amount of available system resources. System resources can be
determined by choosing About Program Manager from the Help menu in Program
Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a program group contains 50 items and you try to create an additional item,
Windows generates the following group file error message:

   This program group already contains the maximum number of items.

The only options are to remove an item from the affected program group to make
room for the additional item or to place the new item in another program group.

If 40 groups already exist in Windows 3.1 and you try to create another group,
you will receive the following group file error message:

   You have created the maximum number of groups possible in Program Manager. To
   create a new group you must first delete a group to make room.

Or, Windows may put the new icons in the Main group, providing there are not 50
items in the Main group already.
