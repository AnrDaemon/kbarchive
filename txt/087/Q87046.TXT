SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP always connects to the designated SMTP host
to send out messages. The gateway receives messages from any host that can
connect to the gateway.

When using TCP as the transport mechanism, a TCP connection is made by the sender
to the receiver's service port 25. When the Microsoft Mail gateway has mail to
send to the SMTP world, it initiates a connection to the designated SMTP host's
service port 25.
