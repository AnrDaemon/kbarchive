SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to disable Future Trends Software's EZSound FX
version 2.0 in Windows 3.1 for testing purposes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

EZSound FX is an application that adds additional sound functionality to Windows
3.0, 3.0a, and 3.1. This package includes ability to play and convert WAV, SND,
VOC, ROL, NXT, SVX, MAC and several other sound formats, a sound file editor, a
CD player, and the ability to assign sounds to system events like resizing a
window. EZSound FX supplements the original sound functionality that ships with
Windows Multimedia Extensions 1.0 and Windows 3.1 when EZSound FX is installed
with them.

Steps to Disable EZSound FX
---------------------------

1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file with a standard ASCII text editor.

2. Locate the [boot] section and make the following changes:

   Before:

         [boot]
         ;EZSound FX Driver
         sound.drv=sfsound.drv
         ;sound.drv=mmsound.drv

   After:

         [boot]
         ;EZSound FX Driver
         ;sound.drv=sfsound.drv
         sound.drv=mmsound.drv

3. Locate the [386enh] section and make the following changes:

   Before:

         [386enh]
         ;The line device=vclmad.386 is used by EZSound FX
         device=vclmad.386

   After:

         [386enh]
         ;The line device=vclmad.386 is used by EZSound FX
         ;device=vclmad.386

4. Steps 2 and 3 disable EZSound FX. If you want to remove the rest of EZSound
   FX's settings, remove (or comment out) the following sections in the
   SYSTEM.INI file:

   [sonic foundry]
   [sfsound.drv]
   [Sampler.dll]
   [MMServices]

5. If necessary, remove any EZSound FX files on the WIN.INI file's load= and
   run= lines, and any EZSound FX icons in the StartUp group.
