======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Intel Technical Support has confirmed that the Intel SatisFAXtion driver,
CASMGR.EXE, may cause Windows 3.1 to hang when entering 386 enhanced mode if
CASMGR is configured to use expanded memory.

CAUSE
=====

The SatisFAXtion Setup program sets up CASMGR.EXE to start from the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. CASMGR uses expanded memory if it's available, and this may conflict with
the page frame that Windows 386 enhanced mode establishes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To disable CASMGR's use of expanded memory:

1. From the FAX subdirectory, type "setup" (without the quotation marks).

2. Choose the Advanced option.

3. Choose Technical Options.

4. In the CASMGR Usage section, choose the option to not use expanded memory.

Disabling this option should allow SatisFAXtion to work in Windows 386 enhanced
mode.

For more information on this problem, contact Intel Technical Support at (503)
629-7000.
