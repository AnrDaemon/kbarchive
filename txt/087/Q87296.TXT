TITLE   :Microsoft Write: Incorrect Page Breaks on Panasonic Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from Microsoft Write to a Panasonic KX-P1124, KX-P1123, or
KX-P1624 printer, the page breaks may not may not print correctly if you have
changed the paper source and have not repaginated the document.

CAUSE
=====

The Panasonic KX-P1124 has a different top and bottom unprintable region
(margin) for the two different paper sources (tractor feed and manual feed).
Tractor feed does not have an unprintable region, and manual feed has a 1/8-inch
top and 1.1875-inch bottom unprintable region.

If your printer driver is configured for tractor feed when you format your
document in Write, you will have no top and bottom unprintable regions. If you
then select manual feed (Called Front Sheet Feeder in the printer driver), you
get different results when you print if you do not repaginate your document. As
a result, it will take two pages to print what it previously took one page to
print.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, always repaginate the document after changing the page
source.
