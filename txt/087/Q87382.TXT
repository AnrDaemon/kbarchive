The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail system itself does not limit the size of an attachment file
that can be created. Outside factors can prevent the creation of a large
attachment file:

 - Hardware limitations: There might not be enough hard disk space to store a
   large attachment file.

 - User configuration limitations: There may be a file size limit set on a
   user's network ID so that large files cannot be created.


Additional query words: 2.10e 3.00 3.20
