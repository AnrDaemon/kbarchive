SYMPTOMS
========

If you use IBM Quickwriter 5204 printer driver version 1.0 supplied with
Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the driver does not print correctly when the
Paper Size setting in Control Panel printer setup is set to US Standard Fanfold
14 7/8 x 11 inch. Windows-based applications print only halfway across the page.
Nothing is printed on the right side of the page.

Instead of wrapping or continuing to the next line, the driver omits all printing
that would normally extend beyond the middle of the page. Although the page is
14 7/8 inches wide, the output contains text only on the left half of the page.

NOTE: Applications that have print preview capability also display a print area
of only half a page.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of this driver
included with Windows 3.1. The problem was corrected in version 1.1 of the
driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

No emulation for the IBM 5204 printer will support US Standard Fanfold size
paper.
