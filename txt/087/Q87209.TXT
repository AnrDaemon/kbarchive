SUMMARY
=======

VM user addresses can be created within the Admin program, or each user can
create personal addresses within the mail client program. This is possible
because of the general-delivery feature of the gateway, which allows MS Mail
users to send mail to any user on any VM node.

Within the Admin program, VM addresses are created in two stages:

1. The administrator defines the VM node in the Gateway/PROFS/Nodes section of
   the Admin program.

2. From the Nodes menu, the administrator chooses the List function and adds
   specific users' addresses to the node.

Within the mail client programs, VM addresses are added to the user's personal
address list in two ways:

1. The MS Mail user can browse and add names from the list of existing VM users
   in the PROFS menu.

2. The MS Mail user can add new VM user addresses from scratch, taking advantage
   of the general-delivery feature.
