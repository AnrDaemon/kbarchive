TITLE   :PRB: Executing CV Results in "Error Executing CV.EXE"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::3.14,4.0,4.01,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 3.14, 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Executing the command cv results in the following error message from CV.COM:

   Error Executing CV.EXE

CAUSE
=====

CV.COM was shipped with MS-DOS 5.0 and was meant for use with versions of
CodeView earlier than 3.14.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete CV.COM if earlier versions of CodeView will not be used, or make sure it
is not in a directory that is specified in the PATH statement before the
directory that contains CV.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 includes the file CV.COM for users of CodeView versions 3.0
to 3.11. When using these versions of CodeView in conjunction with 80386 memory
managers (such as EMM386.EXE) and device drivers or programs that use extended
memory, loss of data may occur. To start CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.11 safely,
use CV.COM. More information on how to use CV.COM can be found in APPNOTES.TXT
that is included with Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0.

The data loss problem has been fixed in CodeView versions 3.14 and later.

Additional query words: 4.00 4.10
