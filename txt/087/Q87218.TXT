SUMMARY
=======

Aside from the command-line options that are necessary in most mail
environments, there are other options that can add functionality and value to
the gateway. A few of these types of options are as follows:

   Option          Description
   ------          -----------

   -BD, -BT, -BR   Often used at sites where the mainframe is shut
                   down for regularly scheduled system maintenance.
                   This enables the LAN administrator to gracefully
                   shut down the Gateway PC before the system maintenance
                   begins, even if it occurs during non-work hours.

   -MR, -MS        Cause the gateway program to write to the SENT.LOG
                   and RECV.LOG files on the gateway postoffice. This
                   allows the LAN administrator to track the exchange
                   of mail with the host.

   -RD, -RE        Allow the LAN administrator to specify whether both
                   encapsulated and unencapsulated copies of each HUB
                   mail message are sent. Used properly, these options
                   can reduce the size of the file being transferred as
                   well as the transfer time.

   -Snnn           Specifies how long HostDisp (or VMGATE) will wait
                   when initiating a session with the gateway VM ID.
                   If no response is received from the VM ID, HostDisp
                   will end the session. This option should be used if
                   the host is not always functioning reliably.
