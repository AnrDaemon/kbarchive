SUMMARY
=======

If HostDisp (or VMGATE) cannot find the 3270 file transfer programs on the PROFS
gateway PC, it will exit to MS-DOS.

This problem usually occurs because the directory containing the SEND and RECEIVE
programs is not included in the gateway PC's MS-DOS Path statement. To correct
this problem, either append the directory to the Path statement or use the -F
parameter on the HostDisp (or VMGATE) command line. The -F option specifies the
directory containing the 3270 file transfer programs.
