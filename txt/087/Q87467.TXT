-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail NETWORK.GLB file is used to define any external postoffices
or gateways that this postoffice can address mail to.


NOTE: Gateway names are defined and added to this file when the gateway is
installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All gateways that use the three-part hierarchy format Network/Postoffice/Mailbox
(SNADS, PROFS, and OfficeVision) will also have an associated .XTN file created.
The .XTN file, in this case, will contain either DGN or node names defined at
that gateway.

The Mail client, Admin, External, and Import programs will require reading this
file to determine the gateways and external postoffices that are accessible by
this postoffice. Only the Admin and Import programs are able to create records
in this file.

If the NETWORK.GLB file is missing, an appropriate error message will be
displayed.

The Mail client and External program will not be able to resolve names using the
postoffice network list.

The Admin program will not be able to create or modify names in the postoffice
network list.
