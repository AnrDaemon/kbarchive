TITLE   :FIX: Breakpoints, Watches Not Restored with Dual Monitor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.05
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.05 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS versions 4.0, 4.01, and 4.05 do not restore
breakpoints or watches between sessions when invoked with "/2" for dual monitor
debugging. Normally, CodeView will restore all breakpoints and watches that were
set from the last debugging session.

CAUSE
=====

An invalid command for dual monitor debugging is listed in the CURRENT.STS file.
When CodeView reads this invalid command, it discontinutes reading the rest of
the status file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the following line from the CURRENT.STS file

      COMMAND:OF+

(turn screen swapping on). This option is not valid in dual-monitor mode. Since
this option is written each time you exit CodeView, you will need to modify the
CURRENT.STS file each time you invoke CodeView.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView versions 4.0, 4.01, and
4.05. This problem was corrected in CodeView version 4.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CodeView stores the following information in the CURRENT.STS file between
debugging sessions:

   Window layout
   Breakpoints
   Watch expressions
   Source, Local, and Memory display options
   Global CodeView options such as case sensitivity and radix

Additional query words: 4.00 4.10
