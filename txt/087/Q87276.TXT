TITLE   :Windows Err Msg: Micro Channel Bus Time-out Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Micro Channel (MC) version of the Creative Labs Sound
Blaster with Windows 3.1, you receive the following error message:

   System error: Micro Channel bus time-out error detected.
   System halted.

CAUSE
=====

This message is caused by an MC device and the MC bus not synching properly
during the bus arbitration process. This error may be caused by the Sound
Blaster MCA or a third-party floppy disk drive for PS/2s.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run Windows in standard mode instead of 386 enhanced mode. This error can also
occur in standard mode, but it is less likely.

NOTE: You should not use the MCADMA= switch (in the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]
section) on any PS/2 other than the model 55sx. This switch should not be used
for this problem.


STATUS
======

Creative Labs is researching this problem and we will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
