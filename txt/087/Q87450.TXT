SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft Diagnostic Utility (MSD) shipped with Windows 3.1 to
identify local COM ports on a personal computer, MSD will erroneously report a
16550AF under "UART Chip Used" when in fact there is no UART (universal
asynchronous receiver transmitter) chip or COM port installed at that address.
This occurs when a utility, such as SETCOM.COM, or a debug script has been used
to create a COM port address in the BIOS data segment for a non-existing COM
port.

Other defaults reported by MSD for the non-existing COM port are:

   Baud Rate: 1
   Parity: Space
   Data Bits: 8
   Stop Bits: 2
   Carrier Detect (CD): Yes
   Ring Indicator: (RI): Yes
   Clear To Send (CTS): Yes

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 16550AF chip is a UART chip with a 16-byte character buffer to reduce
interrupt overhead and errors during high-speed serial transmissions.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 communications comm serial modem
