SUMMARY
=======

You can delete both indirect and direct PROFS gateways from a postoffice using
the Admin program's Delete option. From the Admin program's Gateways menu,
choose PROFS, choose Gateway, then select Delete.

Using the Delete option in the Admin program does not remove all of the
gateway-related files from the postoffice database, however. To remove the
gateway from a database entirely, run the REMOVE.EXE programs shipped with the
Gateway Access and Gateway components. Running REMOVE.EXE from each of these
disks restores postoffices to their "pre-gateway" condition.
