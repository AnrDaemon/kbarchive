The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an application developed for the Microsoft Windows environment with the Open
or Save common dialog box, when the user double-clicks a filename in the dialog
box, the application crashes. However, when the user selects a filename and
chooses the OK button, the operation succeeds.

CAUSE
=====

Because the amount of space reserved for the application's stack is
insufficient, the application overwrites part of its data segment when calling
GetOpenFileName() or GetSaveFileName().

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the application's module definition (.DEF) file to specify at least 8192
bytes for the stack.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
