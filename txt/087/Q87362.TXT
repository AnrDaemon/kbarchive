======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 3.0 or 3.1 on an AST premium 386 or 386c computer, the
Windows Setup program may stop responding (hang) when switching from MS-DOS mode
setup to standard mode setup.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur for either of the following reasons:

 - The CMOS settings are enabled for a math coprocessor (80387), but no physical
   math coprocessor exists.

 - The system contains an older BIOS.

RESOLUTION
==========

Incorrect CMOS Settings
-----------------------

To check or change the AST CMOS settings for a math coprocessor, follow these
steps:

1. Reboot your machine, and press CTRL+ALT+ESC at boot up.

2. Note or change the math coprocessor setting (Enabled or Disabled). Assume
   disabled unless it can be verified by physical i*dentification.

3. Save your changes, and exit from the CMOS setup.

Incorrect BIOS
--------------

According to AST technical support, if the BIOS is AST version 2.10 or early or
dated earlier than 1988, the BIOS should be updated to AST version 3.01. Contact
AST for a BIOS update; the part number for the BIOS is 500- 702-002.
