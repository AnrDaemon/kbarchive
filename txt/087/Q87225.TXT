The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The text below provides a quick reference for the most important SYSTEM.INI
configuration file settings used by version 1.0 of Microsoft Windows for Pen
Computing (Pen Windows). This information should be useful to someone manually
installing Pen Windows or troubleshooting a Pen Windows installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The [boot] section
------------------

mouse.drv=    Set this field to either YESMOUSE.DRV or MOUSE.DRV. If a
              machine has both mouse and tablet hardware installed,
              use MOUSE.DRV. If a machine has only tablet hardware
              installed, use YESMOUSE.DRV. YESMOUSE.DRV is a stub
              mouse driver that merely instructs Windows to display a
              mouse cursor. It has no other functionality.

display.drv=  Set this field to the filename of a pen-enhanced
              display driver. The names of display drivers that have
              been modified by the Pen Windows development team end in
              the letter "P." For example, the pen-enhanced VGA.DRV
              file is named VGAP.DRV. Only the pen-enhanced display
              drivers support inking.

drivers=      This line lists the drivers Windows loads into memory at
              boot time. By default, the Windows Setup program lists
              the MMSYSTEM.DLL driver on this line. Pen Windows
              requires two additional drivers on this line: pen and
              penwindows (must be in lowercase letters). Each driver
              listed on this line must also be found in the [drivers]
              section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

The [drivers] section
---------------------

pen=          Specify the name of the tablet driver in this field. If
              the system uses the Microsoft mouse as its input device,
              the tablet driver is MSMOUSE.DRV. Alternatively, this
              line may list an OEM-specific driver such as NCR.DRV or
              WACOM.DRV.

penwindows=   Set this field to PENWINDOWS.DLL, which contains the
              Pen Windows-based application programming interface (API).

The [Pen Driver] section
------------------------

Com2=         Specify 0 if the tablet is connected to the COM1 port;
              specify 1 if the tablet is connected to COM2 port. The
              tablet works only on the COM1 or COM2 port.

The [386Enh] section
--------------------

device=       If the system uses an OEM-specific tablet driver,
              specify the name of the virtual tablet driver on this
              line.

For each of the settings listed above, if the driver is not installed in the
Windows system directory (by default, C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM), the fully qualified
path to the file must be listed.

For more information about the SYSTEM.INI file settings that affect Windows for
Pen Computing, see Appendix A of the "Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing:
Programmer's Reference" manual. Note that while the manual shows all SYSTEM.INI
file entries, the path to the devices may not be correct.
