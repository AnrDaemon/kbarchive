======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), the following error may occur
when making a Windows application programming interface (API) call from within a
member function of a window class:

   C2660: 'function' : function does not take 'number' parameters

CAUSE
=====

Many of the Windows API calls are accessed in the Microsoft Foundation Classes
through member functions of the same name as the API calls. This means that the
name will be recognized, but because most member functions require fewer
parameters than their API counterparts, the C2660 error occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either of the following two methods eliminates the error:

 - Adjust the function call to conform to the format of the member:

      function call.

      -or-

 - Use the scope resolution operator (::) to tell the compiler to look for the
   function name in the global name space.
