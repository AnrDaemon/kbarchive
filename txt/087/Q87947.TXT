SUMMARY
=======

The DSKLAYT2 utility in the Microsoft Setup Toolkit for Windows creates disk
images using the files specified in the .LYT file produced by the DSKLAYT
utility. The created disk images are flat; all files are placed in the root
directory. DSKLAYT2 does not preserve the tree structure of the source files.

Having flat directories on the setup disks is a limitation of only the DSKLAYT2
utility. _MSTEST.EXE, the setup driver spawned by SETUP.EXE, supports a tree
structure on the setup disks. Once DSKLAYT2 creates disk images, manually create
subdirectories on each disk. Then move files from the root directory of the disk
to the appropriate position in the tree structure. (Do not move files between
disks.) Make corresponding changes to the .INF file. In the file description
line of each moved file, change the filename to indicate the file's new location
in the tree structure.
