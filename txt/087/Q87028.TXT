KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the installation of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP is successful, this
message is displayed:

   Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP installed.

The installation makes these changes to the Mail file system:

MASTER.GLB      (SMTP Gateway bit turned on)
NETWORK.GLB     (check for previous SMTP mailbag)
CONTROL.GLB     (get next available number for creating mailbag)
0000XXXX.MBG    (create SMTP mailbag)
SMTPPUT.EXE     (copy executable to mail executable directory)
SMTPGET.EXE     (copy executable to mail executable directory)
LOCAL.CFG       (copy default copy of configuration file)
ADDR_MAP.CFG    (copy default copy of configuration file)
SMTPXXX.EXE     (copy and rename the appropriate smtpgate executable)

To see the SMTP mailbag created, type the NETWORK.GLB file and look for the
number after the letters SMTP. The configuration options seen in the Admin
program are not viewable until the Access component is installed.
