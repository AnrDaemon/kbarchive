Recommended WordStar with Facelift Installation
-----------------------------------------------

WordStar technical support recommends the following order when installing these
packages:

1. Install WordStar for Windows.

2. Install Bitstream Facelift.

3. Install Correct Grammar for Windows.

WordStar Says Printer Not Installed When Loading
------------------------------------------------

When you first start WordStar with Windows 3.1, you may receive the following
message:

   The printer driver used to create this document is not currently installed.
   Do you want to select another printer?

The WordStar templates were created using Bitstream Facelift version 2.2. To
correct this problem and prevent it from recurring, you should load the
templates, accept the error message, and resave the templates with the default
printer driver.

To save the templates with the default printer driver:

1. In WordStar, choose Open from the File menu.

2. Choose the Template button.

3. Select DEFAULT.WST and choose the OK button.

4. From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.

5. Choose the Document button.

6. Select DEFAULT.WST, then choose the Save button.

7. Close WordStar or open a new file.

8. When WordStar asks to save changes to the template, choose the Yes button.

9. Repeat these steps for every template used.

If the Facelift fonts are still not available, then reinstall the printer driver
and then reinstall Bitstream Facelift.

WordStar, Facelift, and Correct Grammar for Windows are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
