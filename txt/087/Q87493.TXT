TITLE   :BUG: Setup CreateProgmanItem Does Not Overwrite Item
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Setup Toolkit for Windows, when the setup script calls the
CreateProgmanItem() subroutine to replace an existing item in a Microsoft
Windows Program Manager group with cmo% set to cmoOverwrite and with szOther$
set to a nonempty string, the setup driver does not replace the existing item.
Instead, it creates a new item.

CAUSE
=====

_MSTEST, the setup driver spawned by SETUP.EXE, incorrectly forms the name of
the item to overwrite if szOther$ is not an empty string. This prevents _MSTEST
from finding an item in the group with the specified name, and it creates a new
item.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in version 3.1 of the Setup Toolkit for
Windows. If the setup script must specify the icon file, icon resource index, x
and y icon position, or working directory, and if it is unacceptable to
potentially have two items of the same name in a group, the groups must be
manipulated through a dynamic data exchange (DDE) conversation with Program
Manager. Add a function that initiates and manages a DDE conversation with
Program Manager to MCUISTF.DLL and call the function from the setup script.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 3.0 does not support the cmoOverwrite command option flag for the
CreateProgmanItem() subroutine.
