SUMMARY
=======

A gateway, when used in conjunction with electronic mail systems, is designed to
connect two or more dissimilar mail systems. For example, a gateway that links
dissimilar mail systems A and B, sends and receives messages from each mail
system using the protocols associated it.

The gateway changes all the protocols necessary between the two mail systems, but
it does not change the actual data being sent: what you send is what is received
by the destination mail system.

A gateway cannot always provide every service requested by a mail system because
it is limited by the services available at the other mail system. For example,
one mail system may support registered mail. When it sends a registered mail
message through the gateway to another mail system, that receiving mail system
must be able support registered mail. If it does not, registered mail cannot be
used when communicating with this mail system.
