SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Administrator (ADMIN.EXE) and External (EXTERNAL.EXE)
programs require the GROUP.GLB file to determine the members of a group.

The Microsoft Mail clients do not use the GROUP.GLB file. The ADMIN.NME and
ADMIN.GRP files are used for group resolution.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The External program does not use the GROUP.GLB file in the conventional
way to determine group members.

There is also a limitation to the group members an external postoffice user can
send mail to. When a postoffice group is created by the Admin program, a MEM
file is generated solely for the use of the External program.

This MEM file contains the MBG filenames of only the group members that are local
members of the postoffice. There are no external postoffice or gateway address
references in the MEM file. The result is that when a piece of mail is sent from
an external postoffice addressed to that group, only the local members of the
group will receive the message.
