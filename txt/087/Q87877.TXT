======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear when you run Windows 3.1 with Stacker
versions 1.x or 2.0:

   System Error: Write protected disk in drive x:

NOTE: The message may appear when you boot your machine.

CAUSE
=====

This error appears when Stacker write protects the STACVOL.DSK file that it
creates when Stacker is installed. Thus, any time Windows or any other program
tries to write to the hard drive, it cannot because this file is write
protected.

RESOLUTION
==========

For information on how to remove the write protection from STACVOL.DSK, contact
Stac Electronics.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If a file on the compressed drive becomes corrupt, Stacker write protects the
STACVOL.DSK. It does this to protect the integrity of the stacked drive. (This
file is located on the uncompressed drive and has the attributes read-only,
hidden, and system. For example if there is one partition, drive C, then drive D
has the STACVOL.DSK.)

Stacker is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we makeno warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding this product'sperformance or reliability.
