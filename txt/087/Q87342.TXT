TITLE   :PRB: Small Caps Text Unchanged in Windows Help
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a help file developed for version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows Help contains
non-alphabetic characters formatted with the Small Caps character formatting,
the Microsoft Windows Help application displays these characters at normal size.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this limitation, change the case of the characters. The following
macro for version 2.0 of Microsoft Word for Windows performs this conversion:

      Sub MAIN
      StartOfDocument
      EditFindChar .Font = "", .Points = "", .Bold = - 1, \ 
      .Italic = - 1, .Strikeout = - 1, .Hidden = - 1, .SmallCaps = 1, \ 
      .AllCaps = 0, .Underline = - 1, .Color = - 1, .Position = "", \ 
      .Spacing = ""
      EditFind .Find = "", .WholeWord = 0, .MatchCase = 0, \ 
      .Direction = 1, .Format = 1
      While EditFindFound()
           Size = FontSize()
           Size = Size - 2
           FontSize Size
           SmallCaps 0
           ChangeCase 1
           EditFind .Find = "", .WholeWord = 0, .MatchCase = 0, \ 
           .Direction = 1, .Format = 1
      Wend
      End Sub
