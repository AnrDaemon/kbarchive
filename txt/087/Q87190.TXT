SUMMARY
=======

Users on your Microsoft Mail system may encounter the error "Notice 16, Error
reading mail" when attempting to read a piece of mail, or if they are seeing
duplicate headers in their mailbox for a single message. Verify that the source
of the mail was outside of your postoffice (for example, from a host-based
user).

This error is almost certainly caused by a missing or duplicate -P0xx option, or
a missing -V20 option. Check both of these options as follows:

 - Verify that each external process running against your postoffice is using a
   unique -P0xx value: the gateway programs all have unique values by default;
   however, each External program must have a distinct value specified on the
   command line.

 - Check that you do not have a mix of version 2.0 and 2.1 external processes
   running against your postoffice. If so, use the -V20 backward-compatibility
   option on the command line of the version 2.1 programs.
