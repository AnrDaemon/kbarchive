 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP always connects to the designated SMTP host
to send messages. The gateway receives messages from any host that can connect
to the gateway.

When using TCP as the transport mechanism, a TCP connection is made by the sender
to the receiver's service port 25. A host that wants to send mail to the gateway
initiates a connection to the gateway's service port 25.
