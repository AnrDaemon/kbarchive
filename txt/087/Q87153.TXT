SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for the Macintosh keeps a copy of the global
address book on local workstations in the event that offline operation is
needed. This data is stored in the MS Mail Cache file.

A forced download of the address book occurs immediately if the offline
preference is enabled and the update button selected. The offline preference is
located in the preferences section under the Other icon. Any additional
resources needed for offline operation will be downloaded at this time as well.

The address list is automatically checked at logout time. The user can control
the length of time between automatic downloads in the Other preferences screen.
An automatic update can range from 1 to 365 days; the default is 3 days.

Additional query words: 3.10
