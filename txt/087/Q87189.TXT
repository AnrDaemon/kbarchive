SUMMARY
=======

The -P0xx and -V20 options are critical to the correct operation of the
Microsoft Mail gateway program and the mail system. They should be used in
accordance with the specifications described below.

When you run the gateway program (HostDisp or VMGATE) without specifying a -P0xx
option on the command line, process number 097 is used by default. If you are
also running the External program against the same postoffice database, you must
use a unique -P0xx value on the External command line. Generally, values from
001 to 070 are not reserved by any other Microsoft Mail programs, and can be
used by External.

If you are using a variety of external processes on a postoffice (some version
2.0 and some version 2.1), you need to use the -V20 command-line option. This
option is used on the command line of the version 2.1 processes, to have them
use the version 2.0 file-locking method. If all processes are version 2.1, you
do not need to use the -V20 option.

Incorrect or missing -P0xx or -V20 options usually cause missing mail and
duplicate headers in users' mailboxes. For more information, please refer to the
"Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision LAN Administrator's
Guide."
