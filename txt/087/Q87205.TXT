-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Normally the PROFS gateway PC is configured so that the network drivers, 3270
API, and emulation program are all loaded automatically when the system is
started. Often the gateway program is run from another batch file, to allow for
easy modification and testing of command-line options.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below are examples of what you might typically find in a gateway PC's
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.

AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------

The AUTOEXEC.BAT file loads network drivers and loads 3270 emulation.

   @ECHO OFF
   PROMPT $p$g
   PATH C:\DOS;c:\bin;C:\COMMSRV\RBIN;
   SET TEMP=C:\DOS

   @REM == LANMAN 2.1 == DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES == LANMAN 2.1
   PATH C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG;%PATH%
   NETBIND
   NET START WORKSTATION
   @REM == LANMAN 2.1 == DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES === LANMAN 2.1

   net logon vmgate nopassword
   net use m: \\server1\share1 password1
   net use n: \\server2\share2 password2

   SET PATH=C:\COMMSRV\RBIN;%path%

   @REM DO NOT DELETE -- Comm Server setup begins mark
   lh SHARE
   lh c:\COMMSRV\DEV\COMNDIS 5
   lh c:\COMMSRV\RBIN\REMNAP \\comsvr
   @REM DO NOT DELETE -- Comm Server setup ends mark

   c:\commsrv\rbin\dos3270m

At this point, the administrator logs on to the gateway VM ID and makes sure that
the PROFS:IDLE or PROFS:READY prompt appears. The 3270 emulation can then be
made memory-resident, and the administrator hot- keys back to MS-DOS and calls
the batch file that runs the gateway program (HostDisp or VMGATE).

CONFIG.SYS
----------

   DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
   DEVICE=C:\WIN\HIMEM.SYS
   DOS=HIGH
   FILES=30
   BUFFERS=30
   SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM /P /E:400
   LASTDRIVE=Z
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /i:C:\LANMAN.DOS
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\Drivers\Ethernet\3Com\ELNKII.DOS
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\Drivers\Protocol\UBXNS\UBXPS.DOS
