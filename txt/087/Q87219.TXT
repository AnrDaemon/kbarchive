SUMMARY

The HostDisp (or VMGATE) program works in conjunction with the mail system
database and the host to send and receive mail. Here are the steps HostDisp
performs, in order:

1. Checks for LAN mail to be sent to the host.

2. Periodically queries the gateway VM ID to see if there is mail to download
   from the host.

3. Receives mail from the host.

4. Sends mail to host.

5. Processes received mail on the local-area network (LAN).
