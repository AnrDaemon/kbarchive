TITLE   :BUG: OpenFile() API Fails on Novell Temp Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, when an application uses the
OpenFile() API to open a file on a Novell network temporary drive, the function
returns the value HFILE_ERROR to indicate failure.

CAUSE
=====

The OpenFile() function does not properly parse the nonalphabetic characters
that the Novell network redirector uses to represent temporary drive mappings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the _lopen() function to obtain a file handle.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
