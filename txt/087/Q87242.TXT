======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you map a drive at a command prompt using MS-DOS Prompt on a Novell network,
the drive will not be recognized in File Manager if the NWShare Handles option
is not selected in the Control Panel Networks option. After mapping a drive at a
command prompt using MS-DOS Prompt and then exiting MS- DOS Prompt, the mapped
drive will be lost.

CAUSE
=====

This situation occurs because the NWShare Handles option is not activated, which
sets all virtual machines to independent mapping. Independent mapping does not
affect other virtual machines (VMs). The default for the "NWShare Handles" is
false (unmarked).

RESOLUTION
==========

To initialize global mapping in a virtual machine (VM):

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Network icon.

3. In the 386 Enhanced Section, select the option NWShare Handles.

4. Choose OK to save settings.

Now, if you map a drive at a command prompt using MS-DOS Prompt, File Manager
will recognize the drive because the mapping has been made global.
