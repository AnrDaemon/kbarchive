   pc-speaker and driver and setup and initializes

CpuSpeed
--------

This indicates the setting for speaker speed (5-300). Changing this setting slows
down or speeds up the play back of the wave file, and is similar to setting the
speeds on a record turntable. This setting can be changed by doing the
following:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Drivers icon, and select the Wave Driver For PC-Speaker driver.

3. Make any necessary changes and then choose OK.

Volume
------

This indicates the volume level for the speaker. This setting can be adjusted
through the Control Panel as described above.

Version
-------

This indicates the version number of the speaker driver.

Enhanced
--------

This indicates whether Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode or not. The value
is changed when Windows is run in 386 enhanced mode (1), or in standard mode
(0).

MaxSeconds
----------

This indicates the maximum number of seconds a wave file will play (1-10, none).
When set to "none" the maximum becomes a combination of the wave file size and
system memory. This setting can be adjusted through the Control Panel as
described above.

LeaveInterruptsEnabled
----------------------

When this is set to 1, it allows the mouse and other interrupt sensitive devices
to function while a wave file is playing. If left at the default, 0, it will not
allow these devices to function. This setting can be adjusted through the
Control Panel as described above.

The PC-Speaker driver is available on the Microsoft Download Service by dialing
(425) 936-6735. The file is SPEAK.EXE.
