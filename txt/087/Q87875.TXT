SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Bookshelf 1992 Edition contains setup integration tools to integrate
Bookshelf and Microsoft Word for Windows. These tools will not install if you
have an invalid programdir= entry in the [Microsoft Word] section of the WIN.INI
file.

The [Microsoft Word] section in the WIN.INI file must contain a valid
programdir=<path to Word for Windows> entry. Bookshelf's SETUP.EXE program
uses the programdir= entry to determine if and where Word for Windows is
installed on the system.

If this entry is not set correctly, the WIN.INI file can be modified to contain
this entry by either editing the WIN.INI directly using a text editor or by
using the Word for Windows Edit Options command. For more information on the
Edit Options command, refer to your Word for Windows documentation.
