 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order for a PC running the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and
OfficeVision to connect to the mail host and successfully exchange mail, the
3270 emulation and file transfer products must be working. Test these before
running the gateway program (HostDisp or VMGATE), as follows:

1. On the Gateway PC, load the 3270 API (if required) and then the 3270
   emulation program.

2. Log on to the gateway VM ID (for example, MSGATE) and halt the VM gateway by
   typing "hx" (without the quotation marks).

3. At the CMS "Ready" prompt, hot-key back to MS-DOS.

4. From here, you can manually upload and download files, in the same fashion as
   the gateway program. See the 3270 emulation program documentation for
   examples of how to do this.

If you can upload a PC file to the MSGATE's 191 "A" disk and then download the
same file to the LAN server, the gateway program should be able to carry out the
same function. Once this has been tested, you can start the gateway program.
