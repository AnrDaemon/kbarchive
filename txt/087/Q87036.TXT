SUMMARY
=======

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) addresses can be added to these address
lists:

 - Personal address lists (PAL)

   Users can modify their own PAL.

 - SMTP address list

   Only the Mail administrator can add to this list.

 - Postoffice address list (POL)

   Only the Mail administrator can add to the POL.

 - Global address list (GAL)

   The Mail administrator must enable this list from the Admin program. Enabling
   this feature will automatically port all existing addresses in the POL and
   any "gateway" lists to the GAL. This list must be maintained. For information
   on this list, see the "Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide."
