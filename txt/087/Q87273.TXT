======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a directory or copy files in the Microsoft Windows 3.1
File Manager, you may receive the following error message:

   Access Denied. Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected.

If you are using Windows 3.0, the following message appears:

   Cannot create directory.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages can occur when any of the following conditions exist:

 - There is a file in the current directory with the same name as the directory
   that you are attempting to create. You can verify this with the File Manager
   Search command.

 - You try to copy files and the destination path exceeds 63 characters.

 - You try to rename a file that is being used by an application that uses
   SHARE.EXE or VSHARE.386.

 - You have 512 files in the root directory of the hard disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around these errors, rename the file or directory that you are
attempting to create, or copy the files to another location. You may also be
able to work around these errors if you remove unnecessary files from the root
directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may encounter this error message if you try to create a directory whose path
exceeds 63 characters. Windows follows the MS-DOS convention that limits the
length of a subdirectory path to 63 characters.

The maximum length of any subdirectory path cannot exceed 63 bytes, measured from
the beginning of the first name to the end of the last name (excluding slashes
in front or at the end of the PATH statement). MS-DOS function call 47H (Get
Current Directory) requires a 64-byte buffer in memory to return the current
directory path. The returned path is not preceded by a backslash, but it is
terminated by a 0. Therefore, MS-DOS allows 32 nested levels if each
subdirectory name is one letter long. If path exceeds 63 characters, an error
message is displayed.
