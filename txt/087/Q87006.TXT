TITLE   :BUG: Dictionary Receives No DIRQ_SYMBOLGRAPH Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an application developed for Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, the
dictionary function does not receive a DIRQ_SYMBOLGRAPH message for a given
recognition session.

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Pen Computing detected an unrecognized symbol in the symbol graph.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows for Pen Computing version
1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Windows for Pen Computing environment, a dictionary can be designed to
process the DIRQ_SYMBOLGRAPH message. If an application specifies the
RCO_SUGGEST flag in the lRcOption member of the recognition context (RC) data
structure, Windows for Pen Computing sends this message to a dictionary before
any other message. If an application also specifies the RCO_NOSPACEBREAK flag,
the system sends the complete symbol graph to the dictionary. Unfortunately,
Windows for Pen Computing scans the symbol graph for any SYV_UNKNOWN symbols
before the system sends the DIRQ_SYMBOLGRAPH message to the dictionary. If the
symbol graph contains a SYV_UNKNOWN symbol, no DIRQ_SYMBOLGRAPH message is sent.
