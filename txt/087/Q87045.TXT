 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) polls the
SMTP mailbag file on the gateway postoffice database and converts this file to
an "SMTP message." Attachments are searched for non-7-bit characters and user
unknown encoded (uuencoded) if any are found. 7-bit ASCII attachments are
included in the message body.

The gateway then opens an SMTP connection with the designated SMTP host and sends
the mail items. The host will route the message to its final destination.

Upon receiving mail, the gateway checks to see if the recipient is valid. If the
recipient field is invalid, it fails the message, and the log file "user
unknown."

A valid addressee results in the SMTP address being converted to a Microsoft mail
address. Any attachments received are automatically uudecoded if necessary, and
appear as attachments in the Microsoft Mail inbox.
