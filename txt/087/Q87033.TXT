SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to backbone over SMTP. Backboning is where one organization has
one office in location A and another office in location B and mail is exchanged
mail between the two locations using SMTP as the mechanism. Any postoffice can
submit mail to a postoffice at the other location through its respective
gateway.

For example, there may be five postoffices on a local-area network (LAN) in
location A and another five on a LAN in location B, with one postoffice as a
gateway postoffice in each location and the remaining postoffices as downstream
SMTP postoffices.

Backboning and its setup requirements are discussed in the "Backbone Mail"
section in Chapter 3 of the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP Administrator's
Guide."
