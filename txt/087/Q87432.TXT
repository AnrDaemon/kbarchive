SUMMARY
=======

A TPL template file describes how information is input and displayed on the
screen via a template window. All template files are stored in the TPL
subdirectory.

There are two types of templates used by the Mail system: predefined system
templates and (optionally) a custom defined template for local postoffice
users.

The system templates are supplied with the Server and Gateway components of
Microsoft Mail. They should never be modified and are marked as read-only during
installation.

The MS Mail administrator has the option to create an ADMIN.TPL file, which is
used for locally defined users. The ADMIN.TPL file will always have an
associated ADMIN.INF file that contains the data defined by the TPL file.

The record size of the INF file is defined by the contents of the TPL file.
Because of this, the TPL file should never be changed after the initial creation
of the INF file. Template utilities are provided that allow the administrator to
make any changes, if necessary.
