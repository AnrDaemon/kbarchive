SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, when an application calls the
GetGlyphOutline function to retrieve the bitmap for a rotated glyph (the lpmat2
matrix points to a nonidentity rotation matrix) and the glyph is larger than 75
pixels, the returned bitmap contains a partial, nonrotated, glyph.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following five steps:

1. Select the font into an appropriate device context (DC).

2. Determine the size of the bitmap required to hold the rotated glyph by
   performing the following three steps:
   1. Call the GetCharABCWidths() function to determine the (nonrotated) width
      of the black part of glyph. This information is returned in the abcB
      member of an ABC data structure.
   2. Call the GetTextMetrics() function to fill a TEXTMETRICS data structure
      with information about the font. Use the value of the tmHeight member of
      the TEXTMETRICS structure as the height.
   3. Use the angle of rotation to compute the width and height of the rotated
      glyph based on the information above.

3. Create a bitmap of the size calculated in step 2 and select it into a memory
   DC.

4. Create a rotated version of the font by specifying the rotation angle in the
   lfOrientation member of the LOGFONT data structure and select it into the
   memory DC.

5. Call the TextOut() function to write the desired glyph into the memory DC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1.
