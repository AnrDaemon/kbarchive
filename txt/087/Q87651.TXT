SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to address mail items being sent using Microsoft Mail
File Format APIs to an MCI Mail address using the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MCI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here is the format of an MCI Mail address, as it should appear in the FFAPI
file's TO: field:

   TO:MCI:Username^0D EMS:EMSname^0D MBX:MCIMailbox^0D

Here is a description of the options used:

   Option      Description
   ------      -----------

   TO:         This is a required token for the FFAPI file. Multiple
               TO: fields are allowed.

   MCI:        This token indicates that the following address is an
               MCI Mail address.

   Username:   This is the name of the person being sent to.

   ^0D         The ASCII code for a carriage return (required).

   EMS:        This token indicates the name or number of the
               recipient's REMS account.

   EMSname     The actual EMS should be entered here.

   ^0D         The ASCII code for a carriage return (required).

   MBX         This token indicates any additional information
               required by the remote system. If the remote system is
               a Microsoft Mail system, the full Microsoft Mail address
               is entered here.

   MCIMailbox: The actual MBX of the person being sent to. If the
               remote system is a Microsoft Mail system, the full
               Microsoft Mail address is entered here. There can be only
               one MBX field in an address.

   ^0D         The ASCII code for a carriage return (required).

Note that there is a space before the EMS token and one before the MBX token.
These are required. The carriage return symbol at the end of the line is in
addition to whatever code your text editor inserts.

The actual message body requires a header separator after the TEXT: token. That
is, the first line after TEXT: should be a line of 78 characters, to separate
the header from the message body. This needs to be included in the TEXT count.
