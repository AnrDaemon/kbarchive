SUMMARY
=======

Pages 550-551 of the "Microsoft Windows User Guide" version 3.1 incorrectly
indicate that the EMM386.EXE memory manager can be used to give MS-DOS
applications expanded memory in standard mode.

However, in standard mode, EMM386.EXE is disabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 550 incorrectly states:

   You can run the [MS-DOS] application in standard mode, using EMM386.EXE to
   simulate expanded memory.

Page 551 incorrectly tells you how to set up EMM386.EXE for use with MS-DOS
applications in "standard mode" that use expanded memory:

   Add a command line for EMM386.EXE to your CONFIG.SYS file.

   ...
   device=c:\windows\emm386.exe 512

This command line is supposed to allow EMM386.EXE to set up 512K of RAM memory as
expanded memory for use with MS-DOS applications requiring expanded memory.
However, this does not work. If you shell out to MS-DOS and run the MEM command
(MS-DOS 4.01 and 5.0) or run MSD.EXE, you will see that there is no expanded
memory available.

MS-DOS applications can use EMM386.EXE for expanded memory when Windows is not
running.
