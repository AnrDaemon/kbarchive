SUMMARY
=======

When the PROFS gateway PC is running, several different software products work
together to communicate with the gateway VM ID and the mail system database on
the local-area network (LAN).

The Gateway PC loads the gateway program from its hard disk or from a server. The
gateway program (HostDisp or VMGATE) then communicates with the mail system
database using MS-DOS file I/O. This normally takes place through a network
operating system and the associated network protocol, which allows the gateway
to read and write files on the server.

Also, the gateway program uses the 3270 emulation and file transfer programs to
exchange messages with the gateway VM ID. The gateway program talks directly to
the 3270 API to converse with the host, and spawns the SEND and RECEIVE programs
in order to transfer files.
