The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the following issues associated with using Bitstream
Facelift versions 1.0 and 1.2 with Microsoft Windows:

 - Bitstream Facelift Version 1.0 with EGA Display Driver

 - Using Facelift with Hewlett-Packard (HP) Intellifont

NOTE: According to the Bitstream tech support recording, Bitstream no longer
supports Facelift 1.0 or 1.2. They now advise customers to upgrade to Facelift
2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bitstream Facelift Version 1.0 with EGA Display Driver
------------------------------------------------------

When running Facelift 1.0 while installed for the EGA video driver, fonts
displayed in MS-DOS applications that run in a window will not correctly display
IBM extended character sets. This is a limitation of Facelift. For more
information, contact Bitstream technical support.

Using Facelift with HP Intellifont
----------------------------------

Installing Facelift version 1.0 or later while HP Intellifont is installed will
result in Intellifont being disabled.

Delete Facelift and Intellifont, then reinstall them, installing Facelift first.
Both Facelift and Intellifont modify the WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI files; it is
necessary to remove these modifications before reinstalling. Consult the
documentation for Intellifont for Windows and Facelift, or the support
facilities of the respective programs, for instructions on how to delete these
programs.

Neither of these programs will run in real mode and can prevent Windows running
in real mode.

Using Facelift with Canon Bubble-Jet Printers
---------------------------------------------

Facelift version 1.2 will work with the Canon Bubble-Jet printers BJ-10e and
BJ-130e provided you are using the printer drivers that ship on the Supplemental
Driver Library (SDL).

If an early version of Facelift is used, the following will result:

1. The Print option may be unavailable (dimmed).

2. Word for Windows and Excel may show no fonts for this printer.

3. Some applications may give a

   Not able to Print

   error message when starting or trying to print.
