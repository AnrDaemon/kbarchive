SYMPTOMS
========

When switching from a temporary swap file to a permanent swap file, the
following message may be displayed:

   Windows is currently using a temporary swap file located on drive C. This may
   prevent an accurate permanent swap-file analysis.

This message indicates Windows cannot correctly recommend a permanent swap file
setting because of the disk space that is being used by the temporary swap file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In determining the recommended size for a permanent swap file, Windows examines
the following:

1. Largest available block of free contiguous disk space.

2. Total amount of free hard disk space.

If there is a temporary swap file already using disk space, Windows cannot
precisely determine the amount of free contiguous hard disk space available.
Windows does not calculate how much, if any, of the temporary swap file is
contiguous. Switching from a permanent to a temporary swap file does not give
this message because the temporary swap file does not need contiguous disk
space.

After choosing the permanent swap file, restarting Windows, and going back to the
virtual memory settings, there will be a more precise recommended permanent swap
file size. This is because Windows knows the exact amount of space being taken
by the file and its location on the hard drive.

For further information on how Windows determines the swap file size, query on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   recommended and maximum and swap and file and size
