SUMMARY
=======

It is very difficult to rebuild an MBG file. The file is not encrypted and the
contents of the mail headers can be read. To rebuild an MBG file, it would be
necessary for the recovered headers to align on 116-byte boundaries and the
proper MAI filename to be in the correct location. The matching KEY file would
have to be synchronized to the rebuilt MBG file. This process would be
completely manual, because there is no utility to help recover the header
information.

In most cases, the only solution is to restore from a backup file. Microsoft does
not recommend rebuilding an MBG file unless no backups are available, and the
mail is too important to lose.
