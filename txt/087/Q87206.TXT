The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision can be configured and
customized using Admin program options, gateway program command-line options,
character translation options, and sample gateway batch files.

The Admin program allows the LAN administrator to define PROFS nodes and user
addresses and export/import address lists. You can also define connections to
other indirect PROFS gateways.

The gateway program (HostDisp or VMGATE) has many command-line options that can
be used to customize the gateway's operation. These options are all listed in
the LAN administrator's guide; however, you can also print a list by typing
HostDisp ? (or VMGATE ?) at the MS-DOS prompt.

The translation tables for ASCII/EBCDIC characters can be modified by the gateway
administrator. If single characters must be changed, the CHARDISP utility
supplied with the gateway component disks can be used. If you want to use a
different language character set (for example, Spanish), new translation tables
can be transferred to the gateway's 191 "A" disk.

With version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision,
sample gateway batch files are provided in the SAMPLES directory on disk 4 of
the gateway component. There are three batch files, with varying degrees of
complexity. You can use these files to automate and customize the execution of
the gateway program.
