SYMPTOMS
========

One of the following error messages may occur when you select a non-Windows
application in 386 enhanced mode:

   Insufficient memory to run application. Quit one or more applications, or
   free up disk space, to increase available memory. Then try again.

   -or-

   Insufficient memory for application's required space. Decrease PIF KB
   required, or quit one or more applications, or free up disk space, to
   increase available memory. Then try again.

RESOLUTION
==========

If PAGING=OFF is in the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, removing this
line may allow non-Windows applications to run without these error messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PAGING=(Boolean) enables (on) or disables (off) demand paging (virtual memory),
and permanent and temporary swap files. This setting is enabled by default. It
may be disabled if disk space is needed.

In some instances, PAGING is disabled for troubleshooting the inability to run
Windows in 386 enhanced mode. If reversing this setting prevents you from
running in 386 enhanced mode, PAGING must be disabled again.

Windows 3.1
-----------

In Windows 3.1, this setting can be modified by doing the following:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the 386 Enhanced icon.

2. Choose the Virtual Memory button.

3. Choose the Change button.

4. From the New Setting group box, select None from the Type list box. PAGING
   will be disabled.

In Windows 3.0, this setting can only be modified by manually adding the line
PAGING= to the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
