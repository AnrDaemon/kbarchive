SYMPTOMS
========

A FoxPro executable file fails in the Distribution version of FoxPro with a
"Feature not available" error message. However, the executable file works
without error in the Development version.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds to this problem:

1. Eliminate the macro substitution from the application.

2. Create an application that refers to the substituted variables and include
   this application in the project. Do not call this application from any other
   application in the project.
