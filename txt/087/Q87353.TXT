MORE INFORMATION
================

Recommended Publisher's PowerPak Version: 1.57
----------------------------------------------

Atech Software recommends using version 1.57 or later for full compatibility with
Windows 3.1.

GP Faults
---------

Random general protection (GP) faults may occur in Windows 3.1 after Fast Fonts
is installed over Atech PowerPak. Atech Fast Fonts changes the display.drv= line
in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to the following:

   display.drv = FFSCR.DRV

This driver is designed for all kinds of video cards and it is needed to support
true WYSIWYG.

To resolve this problem, delete PPAK.DRV from the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and
restart Windows.

You can also manually change the display.drv= line in the SYSTEM.INI file to use
the Windows 3.1 default video driver, but the display quality of the fonts will
be affected.

Publisher's PowerPak Options Button Unavailable in Notepad and Write
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When using Publisher's PowerPak version 1.2 with Windows 3.1, the Options button
under File Printer Setup is unavailable (dimmed) in Notepad and Write. The
Option dialog box can be accessed from other applications or by choosing the
Printers icon from Control Panel.
