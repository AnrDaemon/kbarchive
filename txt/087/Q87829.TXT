======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Random general protection (GP) faults occur in Windows 3.1 if the filename
extension in the Programs= line of WIN.INI have exactly two spaces between any
of them. If there is one space, or three or more spaces, between the filename
extensions, the GP faults do not occur. GP faults occur randomly, but can be
seen consistently in File Manager when attempting to delete files or scan large
directories.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Programs= line is used by Windows to identify executable files that can be
run in the Windows operating system. The Programs= line in the [windows] section
of the WIN.INI file should appear as follows:

   Programs=com exe bat pif
