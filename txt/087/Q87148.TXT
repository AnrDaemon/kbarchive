SUMMARY
=======

There are two types of local data used by version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for the
Macintosh. They are classified as general cached data and user-specific data.

The general cache data is stored in a file called "MS Mail Cache." This data
includes the entire set of forms, the Address and the Special addressing panes,
the Help resources, any Gateway addressing screens, and the localized address
list. The cache file also contains information regarding the last chosen server
and any logon information contained in the Chooser setup screen. The server copy
of the address book is periodically checked to determine if a new copy needs to
be downloaded to that user's data file. This check occurs at logon, and upon any
change to the address book.

User-specific cached data, such as local mail and Personal Address books, is
stored in one file for each user. The name of the file is the username. This
filename should not be changed. If the username is longer than 31 characters, it
will be truncated at 30 characters, and be followed by ellipses.

The MS Mail Cache file is located in the Preferences folder in System 7. The
local user data file is located inside the MS Mail Local Folder which is located
in the Preferences folder in System 7. Both files are located within the System
folder if System 6 is being used. Neither file uses encryption.
