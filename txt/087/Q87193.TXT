 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision's LAN side gateway
program (HostDisp or VMGATE) communicates with the VM system using 3270 terminal
emulation and file transfer programs.

On the mainframe, you must have IBM file transfer program 5664-281 (IND$FILE) or
a compatible program. On the local-area network (LAN), you can use a variety of
3270 emulation software on your gateway PC. A card supporting one of the
following 3270 APIs is required in the gateway PC:

   IBM High Level
   IBM Low Level
   DCA CUT-mode
   DCA Non-CUT (DFT)
   Novell NetWare 3270
   Microsoft Comm Server version 1.1 with the DCA-DFT emulation API

The gateway program (HostDisp or VMGATE) will spawn the 3270 emulation programs
SEND and RECEIVE to perform the file transfer with the mainframe.
