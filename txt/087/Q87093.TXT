The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you are using Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and you have a Hewlett- Packard
(HP) font cartridge (for example, Pretty Faces) that is not listed in the
Cartridges box of the printer setup dialog box, you can add support for this
cartridge as described in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to add support for your HP font cartridge:

1. Quit Windows. (Do not use the MS-DOS Prompt icon to exit Windows.)

2. Your HP font cartridge includes AUTOFONT Support disks that contain character
   widths and other font information your software will use to format text.

   a. Insert AUTOFONT Support Installer/Metrics disk 1 in drive A.

   b. Type "A:AUTOFONT" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

   c. Follow the screen prompts to install the .TFM files for your cartridge.

3. Start Windows. Run Control Panel, and choose the Printers icon.

4. Make sure an HP LaserJet family printer is active in the Installed Printers
   box.

5. Choose the Configure button.

6. Choose the Setup button.

   NOTE: If you are using a LaserJet III printer, choose the About button to find
   out the version number of your Microsoft PCL/HP LaserJet driver. If it is not
   version 3.7 or later, you will have to order an updated driver from the
   Hewlett-Packard Driver Distribution Center at (303) 353-7650. If your driver
   is recent enough, choose the OK button to return to the Setup window.

7. Choose the Fonts button.

8. Choose the Add Fonts button.

9. Type "C:\AUTOFONT" (without the quotation marks) as the source drive and
   directory. (If you have installed the AutoFont Support files onto another
   drive, indicate the correct path.) Choose the OK button.

10. The HP Font Installer reads the AUTOFONT directory and displays the name of
   your cartridge in the box on the right. Select the name and choose the Add
   button.

11. Choose the OK button if you want to accept the default destination drive and
   directory for your printer font metrics. If you want to store them
   elsewhere, enter the new path.

12. When the HP Font Installer finishes adding the cartridge name to the box on
   the left, choose the Exit button to return to the Setup dialog box.

13. Select the name of your cartridge in the Cartridges box and choose the OK
   button.

14. Choose the OK button until you return to the Control Panel window. You can
   now select your new HP bitmapped cartridge fonts from within a Windows 3.0
   application.

   NOTE: The Cartridges box does not come with screen fonts, so Windows displays
   its own representative screen fonts.
