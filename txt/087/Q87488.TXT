-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This error condition may appear on the startup screen or in the log file when
you start the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400:

   R_ERROR: [MTA] <Dist_umpdu> Routing Failed; O/R name:
   /c=ca/admd=MICROSOFT/pn=DOE.JOHN

This error condition arises when the routing table has not been programmed
correctly. When the gateway MTA receives a piece of mail, it must reference the
ROUTE.CFG table in order to reference the MTA to forward the mail to. If the
gateway cannot ascertain the correct MTA, the error condition is generated.

To program the routing table, refer to the "Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
Administrator's Guide" and configure the file ROUTE.CFG with an appropriate
editor.
