SUMMARY
=======

HUB mail enables you to send mail from one MS Mail postoffice to another, by
means of the PROFS gateway. This effectively uses your mainframe computer as a
"backbone" for mail traveling between two or more local area networks (LANs).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To define a HUB mail connection, select the Ext-Admin/Create function in the
Admin program. Create the new postoffice definition. Select "Indirect" as the
routing type, and enter the direct PROFS gateway name when prompted for the
network name.

The new postoffice must also be defined in the PWACSI DATA file on the gateway VM
ID's 191 "A" disk, and a REROUTE statement must be added in the MS-RSCS
configuration file. This ensures that the HUB mail travels through one gateway
to MS-RSCS, and then from MS-RSCS down through another gateway to the
destination postoffice.

There are two main advantages to using HUB mail:

 - With HUB mail, only one item is created on the host side of the gateway for
   each message with attachments sent from the LAN. A message with multiple
   attachments is encapsulated into one item, and forwarded directly to the
   destination gateway.

 - The External program is not involved in the delivery of the message (between
   two direct gateways). This frees External to handle other tasks, such as
   servicing Remote Mail users.
