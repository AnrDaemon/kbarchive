SUMMARY
=======

For mail sent from the host to the local-area network (LAN), the conversion of
VM addresses to Microsoft Mail addresses is done by the Host Access component of
the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision.

The addresses contained in a message or file delivered to the gateway from the
host are in this form:

   Nodename(UserID)

Before the message is shipped to the LAN, the addresses are converted to the
standard MS Mail format:

   Network/Postoffice/Mailbox

The Nodename is converted to a Network/Postoffice name by using the mappings
defined in the PWACSI DATA file on the gateway's 191 "A" disk. The UserID is
mapped directly to a Mailbox name.

Once the message is transferred by the gateway program (HostDisp or VMGATE) to
the gateway postoffice, it is distributed to the recipients in the same way as
regular LAN mail.
