======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SETUP.SHH will set up only 10 printers listed in the [printers] section. If
there are more than 10 printers listed in this section, the additional printers
will be ignored without any warnings or messages.

To work around this limitation, install the additional printers through Control
Panel or Print Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows Automated Setup option (also called Batch Mode Setup), allows you to
write a script file for Setup (an example called SETUP.SHH comes with Windows
3.1) that automates the Setup program and requires little user input. You can
configure Setup to automatically install certain printers, applications,
hardware options, and other options. The following is an example of the command
line:

   SETUP /H X:\NETWIN\SETUP.SHH /N

NOTE: SETUP.SHH is an example; you can use any acceptable filename with an
extension of .SHH.

For more information on this feature, refer to pages 75-82 of the "Microsoft
Windows Resource Kit" guide for operating system version 3.1.
