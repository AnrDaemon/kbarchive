-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attachmate technical support has confirmed that starting any application after
Extra for Windows version 3.3 has been started may produce the following error
message:

   Insufficient memory to run this application.

CAUSE
=====

This error may be due to corrupt layout files in the Extra for Windows
installation.

To determine if the error is caused by corrupt layout files, start Extra for
Windows with the 3270 icon that is created when Extra is installed (this will
bypass all layout files). If the error message does not occur, the problem is
being caused by Attachmate's layout files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, delete the layout files and then re-create them. For
information on re-creating layout files, contact Attachmate technical support.
