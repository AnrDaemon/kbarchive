The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK), versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Dsklayt2 utility in the Microsoft Setup Toolkit for Windows does not support
duplicate filenames in the source tree. If two or more files have the same name,
Dsklayt2 may place more than one of these files into the root directory of the
same setup disk. If this happens, Dsklayt2 generates a warning message when it
creates a disk image for the disk that warns that the first file is
overwritten.

If two or more files in the source tree for an application share the same name,
rename all but one of the files before running the Dsklayt utility. Use the
Rename Copied File option in the Dsklayt utility to have the filenames changed
back to their original names when SETUP.EXE or _MSTEST.EXE copies the files from
the setup disk to the destination disk.

When Dsklayt2 creates a compressed file, it adds an underscore (_) to the end of
the file extension, replacing the third character if necessary. Therefore,
Dsklayt2 does not support compressed files if the names of the uncompressed
files differ only in the third character of the file extension.
