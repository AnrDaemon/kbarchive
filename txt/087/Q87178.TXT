SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting problems with the LAN side of the Microsoft Gateway to IBM
PROFS, Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) needs as much information as
possible about the problem and your site's gateway configuration:

 - Please supply the versions of both the Gateway and Host Access code, and
   possibly the release of the postoffice that is installed on the local-area
   network (LAN). Also, we may need to know the type of 3270 emulation program
   the gateway PC is using.

 - Please describe the problem as accurately and as definitively as possible.
   For example, rather than stating that "the gateway is down," use a more
   accurate description, such as "LAN mail is not getting uploaded to the host,
   and the resulting files are being copied into the VMGATE\ERR subdirectory."

 - If describing the problem is difficult, the best single source of problem
   information is usually the VMGATE.LOG file in the LOG subdirectory of the
   mail system database. Use the -V -Q -L options to generate a very detailed
   log of gateway activity, which will hopefully indicate the reason why the
   problem is occurring.
