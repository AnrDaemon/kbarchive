KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6x 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft FoxPro menu program works in the development version of FoxPro.
However, if you are using the distribution version of the files (a stand-alone
executable), the menu appears, then the application exits to the main operating
system environment, either MS-DOS, Windows or the Macintosh desktop.

CAUSE
=====

When a menu is generated, running the .MPR file does not put you in an event
loop or a wait state.

RESOLUTION
==========

Incorporate a Foundation READ command into the application.

NOTE: Although the Foundation READ can be used in Visual FoxPro, the preferred
method is to incorporate a READ EVENT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Foundation READ
---------------

To incorporate a foundation READ command in an application, do the following:

1. In FoxPro 2.x, in the Setup section of the menu or program, include the
   following code:

         PUBLIC m.xxx
         m.xxx = .F.

   In Visual FoxPro, in the Cleanup section of the menu or program, include the
   following code prior to any other code:

                 READ EVENTS

2. In FoxPro 2.x, in the Cleanup section of the menu or program, include the
   following code prior to any other code:

         READ VALID m.xxx

3. In FoxPro 2.x, execute the following code when the user chooses the Quit menu
   option:

         m.xxx = .T.
         CLEAR READ ALL

   In Visual FoxPro, execute the following code when the user chooses the Quit
   menu option:

                 CLEAR EVENTS

For additional information, see the EX1.PJX example in the GOODIES\FNDATION
subdirectory and the section on the READ command in the FoxPro version 2.0
"Commands & Functions" or the FoxPro version 2.5 "Language Reference"
manual.
