======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print TrueType fonts from Microsoft Windows 3.1 on a Kyocera F Series
printer, only one line of text is printed per page.

CAUSE
=====

According to Kyocera technical support, earlier Kyocera F Series printers do not
accommodate more than one font on a page. When you use TrueType fonts, the
printer ejects a new page for every font change.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected with a printer BIOS chip upgrade. BIOS versions
6.32 or higher work correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine the Kyocera BIOS version, print a self test page. This page will
also show available memory in the printer.

In the Windows 3.1 PRINTERS.WRI file, section 6.5 "Printing TrueType fonts on
Kyocera F-Series Printers" states that TrueType fonts must be printed as
graphics. Printing TrueType as graphics is an effective workaround.

Kyocera Technical Support confirms that upgrading the printer BIOS will enable
TrueType fonts to print properly.

NOTE: F series laser printers use approximately 200 K of their resident memory
for internal functions. This may limit the size of the print job when printing
TrueType as graphics. This is applicable to all F Series printers.
