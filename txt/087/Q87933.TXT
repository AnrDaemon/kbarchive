SUMMARY
=======

Windows 3.1 allows the use of .RLE (run length encoded) files as background
wallpaper. To use an .RLE file as wallpaper:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Desktop icon.

3. Type the name of the .RLE file in the Wallpaper text box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

.RLE files store pixel color by run length, or the number of similar colored
pixels that are side by side; whereas .BMP files store the color values for each
pixel in the bitmap. A line in a .BMP file may look as follows:

   blue,blue,blue,red,red,white,white,white,white

The line above would appear as follows in an .RLE file:

   3 blue,2 red,4 white

The Wallpaper list box in the Desktop section of Control Panel only displays
files with a .BMP extension. However, .RLE files may be selected by entering the
name of the file in the Wallpaper box.
