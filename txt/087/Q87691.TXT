SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to run Microsoft FoxPro or Microsoft FoxBASE+ across a network fails
with a "File in use by another" error.

CAUSE
=====

The files are locked by another user on the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that each user has EXCLUSIVE set to OFF. This command must be issued
prior to either user opening the database file.

On a peer-to-peer network, also do the following:

1. Change the attributes of the FoxPro .EXE and .OVL files and the FoxBASE+
   .EXE, .OVL, and .RSC files to read-only.

2. Load the MS-DOS SHARE utility on both the workstation and the server. Specify
   the /F:5120 and /L:500 parameters.

3. Share the FoxPro FOXUSER database by marking the file as read-only.
