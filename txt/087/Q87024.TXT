SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP requires a dedicated IBM PC, XT, AT, 80386 or
80486 compatible computer to run the SMTP gateway software. This computer needs
to have access to the Microsoft Mail database and a designated SMTP host. The
Microsoft Mail database normally resides on a local-area network (LAN) server
and access is achieved through a network adapter using the appropriate network
shell/driver software (for example, Microsoft LAN Manager or Novell NetWare).
The SMTP host is accessed by means of a network adapter and the use of a TCP/IP
stack.

Access to both the Mail database and the SMTP host can be achieved either through
one adapter or through separate adapters. To use one adapter, the LAN
shell/driver must coexist with the TCP/IP stack on this adapter. To verify
whether this is possible, consult the installation manuals for these
shell/driver software products. If two adapters are to be used, consult the
installation manuals for the adapters as well.
