The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Hewlett-Packard (HP) has confirmed that HP NewWave version 3.03 was designed
primarily for compatibility with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. When running
NewWave version 3.03 with Windows version 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, the
following error occurs while attempting to run any non-Windows application:

   Cannot run a non-Windows application from the second instance of Windows;
   exit this instance of Windows and run your application from the original
   instance.

After exiting NewWave and restarting Windows 3.1, a different error occurs while
attempting to run non-Windows applications:

   Incorrect system version; reinstall the 386 enhanced mode of Windows.

Expanding WINOA386.MOD (Disk 4) and WINOLDAP.MOD (Disk 5) from the Windows 3.1
disks to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory eliminates the error message and
enables NewWave 3.03 to run in Windows 3.1. For example, to expand WINOA386.MOD,
insert Disk 4 and type the following from the MS-DOS command prompt:

   expand a:\winoa386.mo_ c:\windows\system\winoa386.mod

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows version 3.1 will run properly in standard mode but fails in 386 enhanced
mode under NewWave 3.03 if you run non-Windows applications. The main reason for
these errors is the replacement of WINOA386.MOD and WINOLDAP.MOD in the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory during the installation of NewWave. It also adds
DEVICE=VNWD.386 in the [386Enh] section, but this does not seem to affect
Windows' functionality.

The New Wave products included here are manufactured by NewWave, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
