SUMMARY
=======

For all mail exchanged between the LAN and host by means of the Microsoft Mail
Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, temporary files are created in the VMGATE
directory of the mail system database.

For LAN mail going to the host, HostDisp (or VMGATE) extracts mail items and
places them in a file called CSIOUT.DAT. When the program is ready to transfer
these messages to the host, it copies CSIOUT.DAT to PROFSIN.DAT. The PROFSIN.DAT
file is then used by the 3270 emulator's SEND program to transfer the messages
to the gateway VM ID's 191 "A" disk.

For host mail coming into the LAN, the 3270 emulator's RECEIVE program creates a
file called PROFSOUT.DAT in the VMGATE directory. This file is immediately
copied to CSIIN.DAT by the HostDisp (or VMGATE) program. When HostDisp is ready
to insert this mail into the database, it creates a temporary work file called
CSIWORK.DAT.

All of the files mentioned above are deleted if the mail transfer is successful.
