SUMMARY
=======

When the PROFS gateway or Gateway Access components are installed, several
changes are made to the mail system database.

When installing the Gateway component, the Install program creates a VMGATE
directory at the same level as the other mail system subdirectories (such as
ATT, FOLDERS, MBG, and so forth). Within VMGATE, the Install program creates a
subdirectory call ERR. The VMGATE directory is used to store all temporary files
created during the exchange of mail with the host. The ERR directory is used to
store all mail files that cannot be delivered or returned.

The gateway executable program (HOSTDISP.EXE or VMGATE.EXE) is created by the
Install program in the mail executables directory. A help file for the gateway
program is copied to the HLP directory.

When installing the Gateway Access component, three template files are copied to
the TPL subdirectory of the mail system database, and a help file (PROFS.HLP) is
copied to the HLP subdirectory.
