SUMMARY
=======

The Import/Export function in the Admin program allows the gateway LAN
administrator to synchronize address lists with the VM host manually.

When you select the Import function (from the Admin program's Gateway menu,
choose PROFS, then select Import), you can choose to import VM addresses from
some or all of the VM nodes to which you can connect. The resulting request is
sent through the gateway, and the Host Access component programs create a file
of VM user addresses. This file is subsequently downloaded to the MS Mail
postoffice, and automatically inserted into the database.

When you select Export, the administrator chooses the PROFS gateways to which to
send the list of local MS Mail users and groups. This list is sent to the
gateway(s) as a typical MS Mail message with attachments. The Host Access
component programs forward these items to the VM ID specified to receive such
lists (DIRECTORY_ID in the PWAINIT EXEC file).
