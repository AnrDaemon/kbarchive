The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

In the log of Server Connection for version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks, inconsistent information is occasionally displayed regarding
transferring information. For example:

   Connected to zone ZONE A
   Scanning for site A
   Transferring data to site A
   Can't find site A
   Performing full zone scan
   ....

When the log entry "Transferring data to site A" appears in the log, it means
that the Server Connection has told the local server to begin transferring mail
to the other site. If the local server can't find the bridge server on the other
site, then it returns an error to Server Connection: "Can't find site A."

MORE INFORMATION
================

All processing in Server Connection is asynchronous. In other words, a request
is made to the server and that work is expected to be done. When the request is
made, the log reflects that request. If this request fails, then the log should
reflect that with the next entry.
