Publisher's PowerPak with Windows 3.0 and 3.0a.

 - HP Intellifont and PowerPak Do Not Work Together

MORE INFORMATION
================

Publisher's PowerPak is a real-time font-scaling package for the Microsoft
Windows operating system.

Recommended PowerPak Version: 1.53
----------------------------------

Atech Software recommends using version 1.53 or later for full compatibility with
Microsoft Windows applications requiring standard or 386 enhanced mode or if you
are using super VGA display drivers for 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 resolutions with
256 colors.

Older versions (1.2 and 1.52) of PowerPak create a video driver named
PPAKVGA.DRV. The new version creates the driver FFSCR.DRV (Fast Fonts Screen
Driver). These two drivers are used for all types of video cards.

To find out which version of Publisher's PowerPak is currently installed, choose
Printer Setup from the File menu in any application that supports printing.
Select About, and the version number will be displayed.

NOTE: Atech Software is no longer in business.

HP Intellifont and PowerPak Do Not Work Together
------------------------------------------------

According to Hewlett-Packard (HP) technical support, HP Intellifont for Windows
3.0 and Atech Software's Publisher's PowerPak cannot run at the same time within
Windows 3.0.

To turn off Publisher's PowerPak, change the printer driver to the HP LaserJet
III through the Windows 3.0 Control Panel.

The PowerPak and Intellifont products discussed here are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
