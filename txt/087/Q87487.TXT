SUMMARY
=======

To set the debug option in the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, use the -LD
option (case insensitive) at the command line of the gateway program. You should
disable message timeout (-rt), because it generates a number of debug messages.

Use the -LD option in conjunction with, not in place of, the -LV logging option.
