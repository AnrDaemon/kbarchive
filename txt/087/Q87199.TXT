SUMMARY
=======

The gateway name is required during the installation of the Microsoft Mail
Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision. It is also be required when installing
the Gateway Access component.

The gateway name is used only within the Microsoft Mail system, and is discarded
before mail is sent to the host user. By using a gateway name, the system is
able to define each PROFS user with a three-element address, similar to a native
MS Mail address:

   PROFS user: Gateway/Nodename/UserID
   MS Mail user: Network/Postoffice/Mailbox

This allows the mail system to easily hold PROFS users' addresses within the
database using the same file structure as is used with other MS Mail users.

Once outgoing mail from the LAN is queued up in the correct gateway mailbag, the
gateway software discards the gateway name and uses only the Nodename/UserID to
deliver mail to the recipient.
