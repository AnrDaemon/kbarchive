SUMMARY
=======

The text below lists a number of commercial software tools that convert existing
fonts to TrueType fonts or help build new fonts. The tools are listed in
alphabetical order by name. None of these tools is recommended over any other,
nor over any that are absent from the list. Each of the tools has its own
strengths and weaknesses. Before making any purchase, examine the tool and its
documentation to see if it meets your needs. This list will be updated as more
tools become available.

Some of the following tools run on an Apple Macintosh while others run on an IBM
PC/AT or compatible computer. The same TrueType font can run on a Macintosh or
with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.

To convert a font from the Macintosh to Windows 3.1, save the data fork from a
Macintosh font to a file, copy the file to an MS-DOS-formatted disk, give the
file a .ttf file extension, and use the Windows 3.1 Control Panel to install the
font.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
