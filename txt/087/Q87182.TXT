SUMMARY
=======

Files are copied into the ERR subdirectory only if they are found to be
corrupted, or if the Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS program cannot carry
out one of its functions (for example, if the program cannot insert mail items
from the CSIWORK file into the database).

All files copied into the ERR directory keep their names, but the extensions
change to three-digit numbers. For example, the first CSIWORK.DAT file copied to
the ERR directory is named CSIWORK.001. If the gateway program has to copy
another CSIWORK file into ERR, it calls it CSIWORK.002.

Any file in the ERR directory can be copied back into the VMGATE directory, to
give the gateway program another chance to process it. For example,if you copy
VMGATE\ERR\CSIWORK.001 to VMGATE\CSIWORK.DAT, the gateway again attempts to
insert its contents into the mail system database.

Note that if you are using the -P0xx option on the command line of the gateway
program, this will change the file extensions in the VMGATE directory. For
example, if you use the -P049 option, the files in the VMGATE directory will all
have the extension .D49 rather than .DAT. This must be considered when copying
files from the ERR directory into VMGATE. The gateway program will ignore files
in VMGATE with an extension that is inconsistent with the -P0xx option.
