SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for the Macintosh allows the transfer of messages
from the server to a local workstation and vice-versa.

Provided the Network Manager has assigned the appropriate privileges at the
server level, you can create a folder both on the server and the local
workstation with the same name and transfer all the contents from one folder to
another. This, in effect, allows you to move folders from the server to a local
workstation and vice-versa.

To move a storage folder from one location to another, simply create a folder
with an identical name at the desired destination, move all mail messages to the
new folder location, and then delete the old folder.

Example
-------

To move a folder from the server called "Storage" to a local workstation, choose
the New Folder command from the Mail menu and create a folder called "Storage"
which has a destination of the local machine. Then open the Storage folder
located on the server and move all messages to the Storage folder located on the
local workstation. After the transfer is complete, simply highlight the empty
folder and delete.
