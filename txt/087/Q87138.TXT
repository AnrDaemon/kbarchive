SUMMARY
=======

If you are using Windows version 3.0 and a Core Technologies Busmaster CNT-MCK
Disk Controller with ROM version 2.08 or 2.11, the file BPPARMS.SYS must be
present and referenced in the CONFIG.SYS file. The first line in the CONFIG.SYS
file should read as follows:

       DEVICE=x:\BPPARMS.SYS /M /R

If you are using Windows version 3.1, ROM version 2.11 is necessary and the
DEVICE=BPPARMS.SYS line is not required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With ROM version 2.08, even with the BPPARMS.SYS driver, EMM386 cannot be used.
If EMM386 is used, trying to run Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode will lock the
system or return you the MS-DOS command prompt. ROM version 2.11 for the
controller corrects this problem.

The driver can be downloaded from Core Technologies BBS at (407) 241-2929 or by
contacting Core Technologies technical support at (407) 997-6033.
