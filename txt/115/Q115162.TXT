The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft does not support using Microsoft At Work PC Fax, which ships with
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, with a version 3.2 Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks Windows client.

The Mail client included with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 has code embedded
in its DLLs that allows Microsoft At Work PC Fax to operate. The Mail
client included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks contains
features such as spell checking and demonstrations; however, it does not
contain code that will allow Microsoft At Work PC Fax to run because the
DLLs included with Mail for PC Networks were written much earlier.
