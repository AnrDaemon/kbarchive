TITLE   :Drive Access Problems with Dual-Capacity Bernoulli Drive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2,6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a Bernoulli drive that has two drives in one box and the first
drive is uncompressed and the second drive has been automatically mounted by the
DoubleSpace or DriveSpace automount code, the following problems occur:

 - The compressed drive is mapped over the uncompressed drive.

 - The uncompressed drive is mapped to a host drive.

As a result, the drive letter that was the second drive is inaccessible and
returns the following error when accessed:

   Not ready reading drive J:
   Abort, Retry, Fail.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 6.2 and 6.22. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NOTE: This problem is very rare.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Insert a uncompressed Bernoulli in the first drive bay.

2. Insert a compressed Bernoulli in the second drive bay.

3. Type "drvspace /li" (without the quotation marks). (The system is configured
   incorrectly after DoubleSpace/DriveSpace automatically mounts the second
   drive.)
