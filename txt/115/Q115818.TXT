-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Home CD Sampler Spring 1994 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Errors may occur if you run the Home CD Sampler while you are also running
Microsoft Works or Microsoft Excel. For example, if you switch back and forth
between Home CD Sampler and Works, you may receive a general protection (GP)
fault.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid these problems, do not run Home CD Sampler and Excel or Works at the
same time.

The following message appears when you start Home CD Sampler if it detects that
either Works or Excel is already running:

   Microsoft Home CD Sampler has detected that you have other applications
   running that might interfere with its operations. We recommend that you close
   these applications and run the Microsoft Home CD Sampler again.

If you are already running Home CD Sampler and then you run Works or Excel, no
warning message appears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the Home CD Sampler.

2. Switch to your Windows shell (such as Program Manager).

3. Start Microsoft Works for Windows and create a new Word Processor document.

4. Switch between the Home CD Sampler and Works until the GPF occurs.

The general protection fault usually occurs in either GDI.EXE, MSWORKS.EXE, or
USER.EXE.

NOTE: This problem may be more likely to occur if you are running in a video
resolution higher than 640 x 480 and 256 colors.
