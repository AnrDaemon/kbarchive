TITLE   :PRB: FoxPro for Macintosh Changes Database's Icon After PACK
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users can change the icon associated with a FoxPro database from the standard
FoxPro icon to one of their preference by choosing Get Info from the File menu;
this opens a dialog box where the icon can be selected and then copied or
pasted. However, if a record in the database is marked for deletion and a PACK
command is issued, the icon changes from the users' icon to the FoxPro default
icon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of issuing a PACK command, use the code below as a workaround.

In the following example, CUSTOMER is the database that contains the record that
has been marked for deletion and TEMP is a temporary database:

      USE customer
      COPY TO temp.dbf FOR NOT DELETED()
      USE temp
      SET SAFETY OFF
      COPY TO customer.dbf
      SET SAFETY ON
      USE
      DELETE FILE temp.dbf
