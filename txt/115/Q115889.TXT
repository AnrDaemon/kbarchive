TITLE   :CONFIG.FPM Settings for Behavior Similar to Fox/Windows
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To cause FoxPro for Macintosh to behave as similarly as possible to FoxPro for
Windows, place KEYCOMP, VOLUME, and MACDESKTOP lines in the CONFIG.FPM
configuration file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Create a CONFIG.FPM file containing the following lines:

      VOLUME C: = "<volume_name>"  && Enables MS-DOS-style paths
      KEYCOMP = WINDOWS          && Enables menu shortcut keys
      MACDESKTOP = OFF           && FoxPro windows display in main windoww

For information about setting a drive letter to the volume name, please see the
following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q115482 SET VOLUME Provides Support for MS-DOS-Style Paths

NOTE: You may also want to include a "DEFAULT" line to set the default directory
to a working directory. If the "DEFAULT" line uses an MS-DOS- style path
(instead of a Macintosh-style path), be sure to place it below the "VOLUME" line
in the CONFIG.FPM.

Creating the CONFIG.FPM File
----------------------------

1. Verify that the default directory (folder) is the main FoxPro directory. Type
   "?SYS(2004)" (without the quotation marks) to determine the main FoxPro
   directory, and "?CURDIR()" (without the quotation marks) to determine the
   current directory. If necessary, use the SET DEFAULT command to change the
   default directory.

2. Type "MODIFY FILE CONFIG.FPM" (without the quotation marks) to create the
   configuration file.

3. Type the appropriate VOLUME, KEYCOMP, and MACDESKTOP lines in the CONFIG.FPM
   window.

4. Close the CONFIG.FPM window, saving the changes.

The next time FoxPro starts, it will use these settings in the CONFIG.FPM.
