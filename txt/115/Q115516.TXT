    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 4.2b, 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 4.2b, 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may occur when calling Open() for a CDatabase or CRecordset
object:

   General error: Unable to create file buffer.
   State:S1000,Native:0,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC Cursor Library]

   -or-

   General error: Unable to write to file buffer
   State:S1000, Native:0, Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC Cursor Library]

   -or-

   General error: Unable to close file buffer
   State:S1000, Native:0, Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC Cursor Library]

CAUSE
=====

By default the MFC ODBC CDatabase class loads the ODBC cursor library (16 bit:
ODBCCURS.DLL, 32 bit: ODBCCR32.dll). This allows an application to define
snapshot recordsets (the default) and scroll backward as well as forward through
the recordset. This cursor library caches the records of a snapshot. To perform
the caching, the 16-bit cursor library creates a temporary file in the directory
specified by the TEMP environment variable or, if the TEMP variable is not
defined, in the current directory. The 32-bit cursor library creates a temporary
file in the current directory. A temporary file is created for each CRecordset
object created. If the temporary file cannot be created, the error shown above
occurs. This error most likely occurs for one of the following reasons:

 - There are not enough file handles available for the application.

   -or-

 - There is not enough hard disk space available to create the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the error, increase the number of available file handles for the
application. This can be done by calling the Windows API function
SetHandleCount(). Also, increase the number specified by the "FILES=" line in
the CONFIG.SYS file.

NOTE: On Windows NT calling SetHandleCount() has no effect and Windows NT ignores
the config.sys file. Windows NT limits file handles solely on the amount of
available memory.

Make sure that there is plenty of disk space available in the directory specified
by the TEMP environment variable or the current working directory.
