The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Use an editor to search the Config utility's Customized Mapping for a particular
user who is already mapped.

If you have entered a large number of address maps and need to go directly to one
of them, it is neither quick nor efficient to use the utility and scroll to the
user you want. Using an editor makes the task much easier.

See the documentation for information on how to create and modify this file
manually.
