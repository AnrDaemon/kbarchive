 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS transfers messages between the IBM PROFS mail
system and the Microsoft Mail system by means of the 3270 emulation software
that runs on the gateway computer in conjunction with the VMGATE.EXE program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Messages are either sent to the host or received from the host. VMGATE works in
conjunction with the 3270 emulator to transfer messages between the VM host and
the Microsoft Mail environment.

Messages are transferred to the host system in five minute intervals, or
according to the -nxx VMGATE command-line option. At each interval the VMGATE
program checks the VMGATE subdirectory for the outgoing PROFS mailbag,
PROFSIN.DAT. If the mailbag is there, VMGATE suspends itself and spawns the
emulator's SEND program, using the following hard-coded command line:

   Send Maildata path:\VMGATE\PROFSIN.DAT PROFSIN CSI A (lrecl 80 recfm F

SEND.EXE transfers messages to the VM host side of the gateway, where it is
processed and routed to the intended users.

The VMGATE program polls the host screen session, displaying "PROFS: idle" on the
host screen if there are no messages to be transferred; if there are messages,
VMGATE displays "PROFS:ready," then suspends itself and spawns the Receive
program, using the following hard-coded command line:

   Receive maildata path:\VMGATE\PROFSOUT.DAT PROFSOUT $MESSAGE A
