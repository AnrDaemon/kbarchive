The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The -U and -BD, -BT, -BR options can conflict with each other, so a knowledge of
their precedence is useful in gateway system design. For instance, if -U0 (don't
update gateway) and -BR00:00:60 (break relative at 60 seconds) are specified,
does X400Gate ever terminate?

This article explains basic considerations for these options.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - BD = break date

 - BR = break relative

 - BT = break time

 - U = update interval for the gateway

 - U specifies the update interval for the gateway, the amount of time after
   which the gateway restarts itself by executing itself with its original
   parameters. Break relative (-BR) thus does not work properly with values of
   -U greater than zero.

 - BR should be used only if -U is set to 0 (don't restart).

If -BR is specified and -U is not, -U defaults to 0. If -BR is specified and -U
is specified as non-zero, the gateway logs an ERROR and ignores the update
interval specified.

The -BD and -BT options do not work with -BR, but they work regardless of -U
value.
