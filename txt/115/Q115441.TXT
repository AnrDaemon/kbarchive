SUMMARY
=======

When you TAB from Facilities to Help, the cursor disappears when you press TAB
once, then reappears at Help if you press it a second time. The cursor also
disappears when you move from Cancel to Country and vice versa in Routing.

If the cursor is at X.121 Address, pressing TAB takes you to SSAP. Pressing it
again moves the cursor to TSAP. Pressing it again moves the cursor to User Data.
The next TAB moves the cursor to Facilities. The next TAB simply makes the
cursor disappear, and the next TAB makes it reappear at Help. One final TAB
moves the cursor to OK.

The program is written in Visual Basic, and a space was inserted between
Facilities and Help. One TAB from Facilities moves the cursor to that space, and
another TAB moves it back into the menu.
