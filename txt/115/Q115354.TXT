The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Running the gateway with a -BR option in combination with a non-zero restart
interval can cause an "ERROR 0" (MTA control program).

As a rule, error codes should NOT be 0. For instance, the "Administrator's Guide"
says 0 means "successful result," implying that such a reported state cannot be
an error because it is successful.


This usage in gateway, however, is consistent because the -BR option overrides
the restart interval (the -BT and -BD options do not). If the restart interval
is non-zero, a warning message is sent to the log file with a non-zero error
code.

During a restart, all gateway parameters are preserved. The -BT and -BD options
work as most users expect after a restart because their values are
absolute--they do not depend on the gateway start time. The -BR option is
different: because it is the only -Bx option with a value relative to the
gateway start (or restart) time, it is the only -Bx option that requires the
restart interval to be reset to 0.
