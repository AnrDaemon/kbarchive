-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the configuration procedure of FTP Software's PC/TCP
version 2.3 for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are three configuration options available of running PC/TCP version 2.3 in
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, which are with NetBEUI only, NetBEUI and
NetBIOS, and NetBIOS only.

NetBEUI Only
------------

1. Choose Real Mode NDIS Driver (NDIS2) during the Windows for Workgroups Setup
   procedure.

2. Make the following changes to the CONFIG.SYS file:

    - Verify the following line:

   "Device=<drive>:\<path>\ifshlp.sys" (without the quotation marks)

    - Remove any entries that load the Protocol manager or an NDIS-specific NIC
      driver.

3. Make the following changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

    - Make sure that the NET START command precedes any TSRs (Terminate and Stay
      Resident programs).

      NOTE: Remove the NETBIND command if it exists.

    - Add the following line to load the PC/TCP kernel after the NET START
      command:

   "<drive>:\<path>\Kernel" (without the quotation marks)

4. Make the following changes to the SYSTEM.INI file:

    - Verify and add the following line to the [Boot] section:

   "Network.drv=wfwnet.drv
   Secondnet.drv=<drive>:\<path>\pctcpnet.drv" (without the quotation
   marks)

    - Add the following line to the [386Enh] section:

   "Secondnet=drive:\path\vpctcp.386" (without the quotation marks)

    - If you are going to use PC-NFS to mount remote drivers or printers, add
      the following line to the [386Enh] section:

   "Device=drive:\path\wfwftp.386" (without the quotation marks)

      NOTE: You must use the WFWFTP.386 file available through FTP Software
      Technical Support BBS at (508) 659-6240. The filename is WFW311.EXE. The
      WFWFTP.386 file created for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 will also work
      with Windows for Workgroups 3.1, but not the other way around.

    - Verify and add the following entries are in the [network drivers] section:

   "Netcard=<NDIS driver>
   Transport=ndishlp.sys,*netbeui, <drive>:\<path>\dis_pkt.gup
   LoadRMDrivers=Yes" (without the quotation marks)

5. Make the following changes to the PROTOCOL.INI file:

    - Add a [PKTDRV] section and the following entries:

   "[PKTDRV] DriverName=PKTDRV$ Bindings=<Windows for Workgroups driver
   section nam> IntVec=<Available Software Interrupt>
   ChainVec=<Available Software Interrupt>" (without the quotation marks)

      NOTE: Common interrupts available for entries IntVec and ChainVec are 0x60
      and 0x65, respectively.

6. Restart your computer to start running Windows for Workgroups over the
   NetBEUI stack.

NetBEUI and NetBIOS
-------------------

1. Follow steps 1 - 5 from the previous section of NetBEUI Only.

2. Add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   "<drive>:\<path>\Netbios" (without the quotation marks)

3. Make the following changes to the PROTOCOL.INI file:

    - In the [network.setup] section, change the lana0= entry to lanax= (where x
      is the next available adapter number).

    - In the [NETBEUI] section, change LANABASE=0 to LANABASE=x (where x is the
      same number as the adapter number in the previous bullet).

4. Make the following changes to the PCTCP.INI file:

    - In the [pctcp netbios] section, include the following NetBIOS specific
      parameters:

   "[pctcp netbios]
   Ncbs=64
   Names=32
   Sessions=n (where n equals the same value that is assigned to the
   Tcp-Connections= entry in the [pctcp kernel] section of the PCTCP.INI file)."
   (without the quotation marks)

5. Restart your computer to start running Windows for Workgroups over the
   NetBEUI and NetBIOS stacks.

NetBIOS Only
------------

1. Follow all the steps in the two previous sections of NetBEUI Only and NetBEUI
   and NetBIOS.

2. Comment out the NetMisc= and Transport= entries in the [386Enh] section of
   the SYSTEM.INI file by placing a semicolon (;) in front of each entry.

   For example:

   " ;NetMisc= <entry>
   ;Transport= <entry>" (without the quotation marks)

3. Restart your computer to start running Windows for Workgroups over the
   NetBIOS stack.
