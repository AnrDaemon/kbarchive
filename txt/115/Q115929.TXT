The information in this article applies to:

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

You can create a point-to-point protocol (PPP) log file to help diagnose
connectivity problems between a PPP server and a PPP client when one of the
computers is a Windows NT Remote Access Service client. You can enable this
option by changing a value in the Registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable PPP logging:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP

3. Select the Logging value.

4. From the Edit menu choose DWORD.

5. Press 1 and choose OK.

   NOTE: A data value of 1 is standard logging, but setting this value to 2 will
   enable PPP logging in verbose mode.

6. Reboot the Computer.

PPP logging is helpful when used with an understanding of the PPP protocol and in
conjunction with the following PPP RFCs: 1661 (supercedes 1548), 1549, 1552,
1334, and 1332.

Logging information is placed in %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\RAS\PPP.LOG

If you are using the Routing and Remote Access Service update, the above settings
no longer apply. For more information regarding how to enable logging in Routing
and Remote Access, see the following Knowledge Base article:
