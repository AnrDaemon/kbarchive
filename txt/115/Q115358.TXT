The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 2.1 and 3.0 of the X.400 gateway allow you to enter ASCII values in the
TSAP and SSAP fields, but not hexadecimal values, which were also required. Hex
values have to be entered in the form $xx$xx, in order to be compatible with
other hex fields, but this required more room than was available in the TSAP and
SSAP fields.


Additional query words: 3.20
