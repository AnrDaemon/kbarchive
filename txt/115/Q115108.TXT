TITLE   :Cursor Name Must Be Alias, Not .DBF Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following commands will cause a syntax error:

      CREATE CURSOR 'new cursor' (name c(20))
      SELECT * FROM tutorial\customer INTO CURSOR 'new cursor'

CAUSE
=====

The cursor name specified is a valid .DBF name for FoxPro for Macintosh, but is
not a valid alias name. The cursor name must be a valid alias name.

The documentation for the CREATE CURSOR command on page 282 in the "Language
Reference" and in the online Help file shows the following syntax:

      CREATE CURSOR <dbf_name>

This syntax is incorrect. It should say "<alias_name>" instead of
"<dbf_name>". The SELECT - SQL command does not specify whether a .DBF or
alias name must be used when the output is selected into a cursor. If the query
is directed into a cursor, a valid alias name must be used. If the query is
directed into a table, a valid table name must be used. Selecting into a table
instead of a cursor allows the use of spaces within a table name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do the following:

 - Use a valid alias name. A valid alias name can contain up to 10 letters,
   digits, or underscores, and must begin with a letter or an underscore.

 - If the output filename must contain spaces, use the CREATE TABLE or SELECT
   ... INTO TABLE commands.
