SUMMARY
=======

Chapter 9 of the Visual C++ "Programming Techniques" manual includes information
on what the setup program for a Win32 application must do when installing on
Windows Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 1.0. However, this
documentation does not cover which Win32s files should be copied and from where
they should be copied. This additional information is located in the "Win32s
Programmer's Reference" (WIN32.HLP), which is included with the Win32 SDK.

NOTE: This information is specific to the version of Win32s that is supplied with
Visual C++ 32-bit Edition and does not apply to Win32s, versions 1.15 or 1.2.

      w32sys.dll
      win32s.ini*
      win32s16.dll
      winmm16.dll

   * The WIN32S.INI file is not shipped as part of Win32s, but should be created
