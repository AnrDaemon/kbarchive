KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP sometimes encounters this
error when it tries to put incoming mail into an MS Mail postoffice:

   spawning SMTPPUT
   ERROR SMTPPUT
   [tx] 552 Error in local delivery

CAUSE
=====

The process that puts incoming SMTP messages into the MS Mail postoffice--
SMTPPUT--was unable to complete. The Gateway PC won't take responsibility for
the incoming message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve a problem with SMTPPUT, check the files involved with putting mail
into an MS Mail database. Check these files and directories to ensure that none
have inappropriate attributes or are hidden, ownerless, locked open, or
corrupt:

 - The GLB and all .GLB files

 - All directories under MAI and ATT

 - The P1 directory and all files beneath it

NOTE: Use ATTRIB to check for hidden files. Under Novell NetWare, use the NDIR
command to check for ownerless files.
