 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you create a MAPTBL.OUT file that contains invalid character(s), then run the
Config utility on the postoffice and select the Customized Mapping box, a
warning message (Invalid character in mapping data) and the MSM: address
(presumably of the record that contains the invalid character) are displayed.

The error message reads (for example):

   Invalid character X in mapping data: c=ca;a=telXcom.canada...

and the utility deletes any invalid characters.

Config reads and displays MAPTBL.OUT information verbatim. Only when you access
an address in the file or attempt to add a new one does the utility insist on
correct characters.
