SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the FILER.EXE file management utility from Novell NetWare version
3.x to copy files from a NetWare server, you may receive a sharing violation
error message.

exclusive mode and then attempts to set the file attributes of the open file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Copy the files manually.

   -or-

 - Use a later version of FILER.EXE. This behavior does not occur with the
   version of FILER.EXE that ships with Novell NetWare 4.x.

MORE INFORMATION

This behavior is not limited to Windows 95; it occurs if you perform the same
function in MS-DOS with SHARE.EXE loaded.
