PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP may produce the following error when starting:

   Error bind (110) smtp_listen system error

CAUSE
=====

When the SMTP gateway starts, it attempts to lock open the first socket from the
TCP/IP software. If the socket is not available or is already locked open by an
incoming connection, the error occurs.


RESOLUTION
==========

Try to restart the SMTP gateway. If you still get the error, ensure that the
mail routing host has nothing queued up for the SMTP gateway and then try to
restart the gateway again.

You can also disconnect the network cable from the SMTP gateway computer, start
the gateway and plug the network cable back in to ensure there are no incoming
connections.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mail Gateway to SMTP version
3.0. To resolve this problem, obtain the TCPTSR.EXE upgrade (dated 09/06/95,
66,816 bytes).
