PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.5,2.0,4.0,6.0,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC kbVC410fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the /Yc option is used to create a precompiled header from a header file
which contains a syntax error, as shown in the code below, the compiler will
incorrectly generate the following error:

   

  error C2857: '#include' statement specified with the /Yctest.h
               command line option was not found in the source file

This error is generated after the header file syntax errors are listed and after
all lines of the source file have been processed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Correct the syntax errors contained in the header file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed above.
This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 4.1.
