The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The routing table requires that all literal blanks in an attribute value be
escaped by a '\' but the Config utility does not do that for MTA names. For
example: if MTA name is "MTA_Name" you must enter it as "MTA\_Name" in the
routing table, or the routing fails with "MTA not found."

The requirements are:

 - MTA names are escaped in ROUTE.CFG, but written verbatim everywhere else.
   Output directories are escaped with underscores, and only the first 8
   characters are used.

 - Advanced address mapping has spaces escaped to underscores.

 - Everything else is stored verbatim.

Additional query words: 3.20
