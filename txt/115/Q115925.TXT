-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.1 or later with a customized network installation, you receive the
following error message:

   Windows Setup

   Cannot find the SETUP.INF file necessary to run Setup. Be sure that the file
   is in a directory of the default path.

For example, using the following command could generate the above error message

   setup /n /o:example.inf

where /o: is pointing to a customized SETUP.INF file (in this case,
EXAMPLE.INF).

Also, no customized files specified to be copied in the [win.copy] section (or
similar sections) are actually copied, and no new Program Manager groups are
created.


CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the character-mode portion of the Windows Setup
program uses the customized name for the SETUP.INF file, but the graphical
portion of Setup expects to find the actual SETUP.INF filename.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this error, you must not use the /O switch when you use the /N option.
If you need customized setup files, make a backup copy of SETUP.INF, then copy
your customized .INF (EXAMPLE.INF in the example above) over SETUP.INF and run
SETUP /N.
