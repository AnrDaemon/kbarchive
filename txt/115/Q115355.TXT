TITLE   :X400: Update Utility Crashes with "Out of memory" Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Update utility crashes with these messages:

   Out of memory in line 0 of module ADVADDR at address 46A4:0cDD
   Press any key to return to system

Records following the one that caused the error also are lost.

CAUSE
=====

This problem was traced to invalid X.400 address fields. It was also found to
occur when entries contain MSMail information but omit X.400 information, in
which case the Update utility issues a message but does not crash.

When this bug exhausts available memory, the Config utility drops the invalid
fields (as it should) and all records following the one with the null X.400
address field are lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

Code was added to alert you of this condition. If a message contains a null
X.400 string, this message now is displayed:

   No X.400: in advanced address mapping string

along with an OK button. If you click on OK, the utility terminates cleanly. Fill
in the X.400 field in the message.

STATUS
======

Resolved.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE BEHAVIOR
---------------------------

1. Manually create an input file to X400CMAP and enter some invalid fields in an
   X.400 address. For example: xxx=yyy; abc=aaa.

2. X400DMAP this file into a postoffice database.

3. Run X400ADM on this PO and select the Customized Mapping menu.

4. Select the record with the invalid fields: you have to know which one it
   is--the invalid fields are not displayed.

5. Select "Update" to update the record. This should drop the invalid fields.

6. Select "OK" to exit the menu.

The utility crashes with these messages:

   Out of memory in line 0 of module ADVADDR at address 46A4:0cDD
   Press any key to return to system

Note: Skipping steps 4 and 5 above produces the same behavior. You can also
trigger this failure mode by entering the MSMail information but leaving the
X.400 information blank.
