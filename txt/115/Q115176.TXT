SUMMARY
=======

The Quarterdeck Qemm 7.03 READ.ME file states the following:

   If you are using QEMM's Stealth DoubleSpace feature and you decide to switch
   back to MS-DOS 6's memory manager, the ST-DBL.SYS driver will perform the
   same function as DOS's DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE. That is, it will allow
   DBLSPACE.BIN to be moved into upper memory. You can replace ST-DBL.SYS with
   DBLSPACE.SYS, but you will suffer no ill effects if you do not.

Although this is true, you do sacrifice approximately 12 kilobytes of
conventional memory readme

Additional query words: 6.22
