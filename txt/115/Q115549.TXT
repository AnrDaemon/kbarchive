TITLE   :FAX: Ferrari Board Functions; Gateway Fails w/ Corrupt RRS.FAX
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Ferrari fax board continues to process faxes but the Fax gateway fails to
operate because of a corrupt RRS.FAX file.

CAUSE
=====

The Ferrari fax board queue is out of sync with the RRS.FAX file. This problem
can be caused by fax failures. It requires maintenance on the fax board-level
queue.

The Ferrari fax board software has no control of the board-level queue, so it
cannot clear a current process or clear the queue of pending outgoing faxes.
This is a design limitation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall the Ferrari software. Compress the RRS.FAX file using the Microsoft
Mail Administrator (ADMIN.EXE) program: select the Gateway, FAX, Compress menu
commands.
