======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy files to a floppy disk using File Manager, you receive the
following error message:

   The destination drive is full.
   Insert a new disk to continue

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11
-----------------------------------

This problem occurs under Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11 when the total file
size exceeds the available space on the destination disk (so that a second disk
is required to complete the copy procedure).

When you check the files on the first disk, you find that the date and time
stamps of all the files copied have been changed to reflect the current system
date and time. Even if you cancel this procedure, the date and time stamps of
those files copied to the first disk are modified.

Windows 3.1 and 3.11
--------------------

This problem occurs under Windows 3.1 and 3.11 when the destination floppy disks
contain the same directory name as the source directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.1 and 3.11
and Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
