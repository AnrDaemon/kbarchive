SUMMARY
=======

PC Tools version 9.0 Optimizer generates the following error message when used
with DriveSpace:

   Optimizer Execution Error

   The DBLSPACE drive internal structure is damaged. Optimizer cannot continue.

Running PC Tools DiskFix as detailed the PC Tools "User's Guide" to correct this
error results in corruption to the DriveSpace compressed volume file (CVF).

PC Tools 9.0 does not recognize the new DriveSpace format; therefore, to avoid
possible data corruption, run MS-DOS 6.22 ScanDisk rather than PC Tools 9.0.
