TITLE   :Installing Sound Producer Pro Alters ANSI Escape Sequences
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.x,4.x,5.x,6.0,6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Prompts, menus, screen colors, or screen settings that use ANSI escape sequences
do not function properly after you install the Orchid Sound Producer Pro
software.

CAUSE
=====

When making modifications to the CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT file(s), the
setup program for the Orchid Sound Producer Pro software converts all the
letters in these files to uppercase. This may alter the functionality of certain
entries that use ANSI escape sequences.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, manually edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT and/or CONFIG.SYS
file(s) and change letters in all statements that use an ANSI escape sequence
(such as PROMPT, ECHO, and so forth) back to the proper case.

STATUS
======

Orchid Technical Support has confirmed that this is a problem in versions 1.0
and 1.1 of the Sound Producer Pro software. For more information, contact Orchid
Technical Support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As an example, the following MS-DOS PROMPT command results in bright red text on
a black background:

   prompt $e[1m$e[31m$e[40m $p$g

If this line is converted to uppercase letters as follows

   PROMPT $E[1M$E[31M $E[40M $P$G

the result is white text on a black background, and the prompt appears as
follows:

   MMM C:\>
