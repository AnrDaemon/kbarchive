TITLE   :X400: SMTP Address Dropped from To and CC Lists
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message to the X.400 gateway with an SMTP address in the TO: or
CC: list, the SMTP address is dropped.

CAUSE
=====

SMTP addresses selected from the global/POSTOFFICE address list are displayed.
One-off SMTP addresses (entered by the originator) are not displayed.


RESOLUTION
==========

The gateway now creates a free-form name for all recipients as follows:

 - if only a foreign email address is available, enclose it in single quotes:

   'laurahal@microsoft.com'

 - use a friendly name if one is available, and put the foreign address in
   parentheses:

   Laura Halliday (laurahal@microsoft.com)

The SMTP address is shown with its friendly name but it cannot be replied to.
