The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows for Workgroups 3.11 from Windows 3.1, you receive
one of the following error messages when you try to access a modem (or other
serial device) or when you try to print:

 - Port is currently in use or is not supported by Windows.

   -or-

 - System Error. The operating system cannot open the specified port.

   -or-

 - LPTx is currently being used by another application

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur if Windows for Workgroups Setup does not correctly change the
SYSTEM.INI file to include the new 386 enhanced mode communication device
drivers. These errors can also occur under Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
when a third-party communication driver has replaced the COMM.DRV in the [BOOT]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, edit the SYSTEM.INI file and make sure that the
following lines exist in the [386Enh] section:

      device=vcomm.386
      device=serial.386
      device=lpt.386
