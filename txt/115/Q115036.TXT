-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The information below describes the Mail Merge Wizard and how to use it to
create a mail merge.

This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Mail Merge Wizard"
topic.

NOTE: The FoxPro for MS-DOS Mail Merge Wizard only performs steps 1, 2, and 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using a Microsoft FoxPro table, the Mail Merge Wizard creates a data source that
your word processor can use in a mail merge. After completing the wizard, follow
your word processor's steps for merging this data source with a main document
such as a form letter, label, envelope, or catalog.

NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows for the mail merge, you
must first clear the Exclusive check box in the Catalog Manager Settings dialog
(to turn exclusive OFF). If you don't clear the check box, a "File in Use" error
occurs before you can complete the wizard.

MAIL MERGE WIZARD STEPS
-----------------------

Step 1 of 5: Selecting a Table
------------------------------

NOTE: This step is skipped in FoxPro 2.6x if you start the wizard from the
Catalog Manager, and a table is already in use. In Visual FoxPro, this step is
never skipped. It allows you to open a new table or select one from an open
database, and pick the fields you want to use for the mail merge.

First select the table you want to use as a data source for your mail merge. The
list contains the tables that were open when you started the wizard. If you want
to use a table that is not currently open, choose the Open... button.

Step 2 of 5: Specifying Your Word Processing Program
----------------------------------------------------

From the list, select the word processing program you'll be using.

If you choose the Word for MS-DOS, WordPerfect, or Other options, the wizard
skips to Step 5 of 5 so you can complete the mail merge.

Step 3 of 5: Selecting or Creating a Main Document (Microsoft Word for Windows users)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you selected Microsoft Word version 2.0 or 6.0 for Windows, this screen
displays so you can either create a new main document or select a main document
you have already created.

If you need to create a main document, select the Create new document option, and
choose Next to continue.

If you have already created a main document, select the Use existing document
option and enter the file name, or choose the File... button to open the
document, then choose Next. The wizard will skip to Step 5 of 5.

Step 4 of 5: Specifying the Type of Main Document (Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows Users Only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This step appears only if you choose to create a new Microsoft Word 6.0 for
Windows main document.

Select the type of Microsoft Word 6.0 main document you want to create: form
letter, label, envelope, or catalog. Consult you Microsoft Word documentation
for more information about these options.

Step 5 of 5: Completing the Mail Merge
--------------------------------------

If you are using Microsoft Word version 2.0 or 6.0 for Windows, choosing the
Finish button starts up Microsoft Word so that you can continue with the mail
merge process.

If you are using another word processor, choosing the Finish button displays the
Save As dialog, so that you can save your source document as a text file. Next,
start your word processor and use the document you created as a data source for
the mail merge.
