The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you check Include Special Attachment, WINMAIL.DAT is not sent; if you
clear Include Special Attachment, WINMAIL.DAT is sent.

This was due to a change in the field name. The confusion arose because
the label is "Include Special Attachment," while the X400GATE.INI parameter
is InternalAttachment, which if set means to remove WINMAIL.DAT.
