SUMMARY
=======

While you are upgrading, using the Config utility to update a manually created
routing table wherein all MTA names with '_'s are escaped with '\'s, turns all
the single '\'s into double '\'s. For example:

   PO4\_MTA

becomes:

   PO4\\_MTA

By design, this process follows the old Admin's behavior exactly: it writes
things as they are to the .CFG files and requires that you escape MTA names in
ROUTE.CFG. This also means that you can have MTA names with blanks in them, but
the utility cannot differentiate blanks from '_'s.

For example:

   MTA_X

is seen as:

   MTA X
