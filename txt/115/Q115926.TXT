TITLE   :Network Driver Error 7212 Sharing a Drive in File Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to share a drive in File Manager, you receive the following error
message:

   Network Drivers Error 7212

When you receive this error, you are unable to set up any additional shared
resources. However, you still have full network access, and other users can
still access your previously shared resources. Also, if you remove a shared
drive, you cannot set it up again as a shared drive.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when:

 - Your password file is corrupted.

 - You have deleted and re-created a shared network fax directory. After the
   error message occurs, Windows for Workgroups does not let you rename or
   delete the .PWL files from File Manager.

 - You add a new hard disk drive and then attempt to share it, but the drive
   letter conflicts with a letter previously used for a network connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

Delete or rename the *.PWL files located in your Windows directory (SHARES.PWL
and <username>.PWL). You should then be able to share additional
directories.

NOTE: If you are using a personal certificate, you should export it before
renaming your .pwl file. If you do not do so, it may be unavailable when you
send e-mail. For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q190296 Unable to Use Personal Certificates in Outlook Express

MORE INFORMATION
================

Typing "net help 7212" (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command prompt
in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 generates the following message:

   Error 7212: The password-list file is already open.

Additional query words: 3.10 err msg
