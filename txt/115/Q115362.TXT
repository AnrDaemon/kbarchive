TITLE   :X400: X400ADM.EXE Crashes to MS-DOS, Database Is Corrupted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you start X400ADM.EXE, select the Local MTA button, enter a name and put a
period and a comma at the end of the name, then enter the Country Code and Admd
Name and select OK, the program crashes to MS-DOS with the message:

   Path not found in line 0 of module LOCALMTA at address 9B84:06DA

If you restart X400ADM.EXE and select the Local MTA button, you see that the
database is corrupted:

 - the Country Code entry is in the Admd Name field

 - the Admd Name entry is moved to the Prmd Name field

 - the MTA's (name) entry is gone from the OUTGOING subdirectory

CAUSE
=====

The comma is not a valid Name field character because the program interprets
commas as separators--in this case for the Name and Password fields. For
example:

   MTA01,,,us, ATTMAIL,

When this happens the data in the Country Code and Admd Name fields is displayed
in the next field down (Country Code to Admd Name; Admd Name to Prmd Name).

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove commas from MTA field entries.

The failure is most spectacular in the MTA name, but a comma causes the same
confusion in any MTA information field, since the underlying data file is
delimited with commas.
