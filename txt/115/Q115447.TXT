TITLE   :X400: Corrupt .XTN File for Network Postoffice Stops Install
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you enter the network name of a postoffice when you are installing the access
component of the X.400 gateway, a corrupt .XTN file for that network (for
example: invalid length) causes the install program to exit, and returns you to
an MS-DOS prompt.

CAUSE
=====

Because the .XTN file contains the postoffice definitions for an external
network, a corrupt one has system consequences so severe that Install simply
exits. The gateway does not report the exact condition leading to the Install
failure.


RESOLUTION
==========
