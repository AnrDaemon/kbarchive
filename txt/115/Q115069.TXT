The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you print from Creative Writer to a BubbleJet 600c color printer, using the
Epson LQ 2550 or Epson LQ 860 driver, you may see text or graphics shifting to
the next page. This becomes most apparent when printing a large number of pages
at once. The text will shift down further and further on each successive page.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two options for resolving the problem:

1. Use the Canon BubbleJet 600c printer driver.

   -or-

2. Print a limited number of pages at a time because the shifting becomes most
   obvious when many pages are printed at one time.

After using one of these workarounds, you should be able to print correctly from
Creative Writer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Epson LQ 2550 and Epson LQ 860 drivers use a slightly different page size
than the Canon BubbleJet driver.

However, if you emulate the Epson using the Canon BJC4000, you must set Dip
Switch 11 to the ON position. That setting sets up the printer for Epson
emulation. Refer to the BJC4000 user manual for more information about dip
switches.
