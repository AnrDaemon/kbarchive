SUMMARY
=======

The backslash (\) character has a special meaning when it is part of a string in
an AppleScript script. The backslash is used to indicate the start of an escape
sequence. To use a backslash in an AppleScript string, use two backslashes (\\).

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the following AppleScript script is meant to change the default
folder from the main FoxPro folder to the TUTORIAL subfolder.

      tell application "Microsoft FoxPro"
         Do Script "SET DEFAULT TO .\tutorial "
      end tell

The \t will be interpreted as a horizontal TAB character that will cause the
command to fail without an error message. To correct this problem, the syntax of
the AppleScript script should be:

      tell application "Microsoft FoxPro"
         Do Script "SET DEFAULT TO .\\tutorial"
      end tell

Depending on what character follows the backslash, three results could occur:

 - The command will fail without an error message.

 - The command will fail, causing an error message such as "Unrecognized
   phrase/keyword in command" in Microsoft FoxPro.

 - The command will cause an error message such as "Expected "" but found
   unknown token" in the AppleScript Editor.
