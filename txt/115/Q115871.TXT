TITLE   :Quitting a PM Application with End Task Generates Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT Task List to quit a Presentation Manager-based
application, a dialog box with the title of the application you just quit
appears and you can choose Cancel, Wait, or End Task.

This dialog box is not necessary because you have already quit the application.
Choosing either of the options only makes the dialog box disappear.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because choosing the End Task button from the Windows NT
Task List generates the dialog box before the selected Presentation
Manager-based application before switching to the Presentation Manager desktop.

WORKAROUND
==========

When this dialog box appears, choose Cancel. Choosing either of the buttons
closes the dialog box.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT Add-on SubSystem
for Presentation Manager for Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1.
