The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 supports the ES to IS routing
protocol within its CLNP layer, so you can run it over a TP4/CLNP network.

These systems send ES-hellos and answer the ES-hellos of other systems, and this
makes them automatically aware of other nodes' network addresses.

If a node cannot send or answer ES-hellos, you must manually add its network
address at the node by running the following command on the system on which you
are running the gateway TP4/CLNP:

   addrte NSAP MAC

To ensure that the remote network SAP value and MAC address were correctly added,
run the ESQ command.

For more information, see the "TP4/CLNP Configuration and Utilities Guide."
