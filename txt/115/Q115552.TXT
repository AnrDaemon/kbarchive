-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Although version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS is normally spawned from
within the MHS Host, the gateway can be run from a command line as long as the
parameters used are the same as those from MHS.

The MHS gateway has two active components:

   Component     Description
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   INPOST.EXE    Gets messages from the Microsoft Mail database and puts
                 them into MHS

   OUTPOST.EXE   Gets messages from MHS and puts them into Microsoft Mail

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a gateway is defined in MHS, a subdirectory is created in the
MHS\MAIL\GATES directory. This subdirectory has the same name as the gateway and
contains the following five subdirectories:

   Directory   Description
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   IN          Where INPOST.EXE places messages going from Microsoft Mail
               to MHS

   IPARCEL     Where corresponding incoming attachments are placed

   OUT         Where OUTPOST.EXE places messages going from MHS to
               Microsoft Mail

   OPARCEL     Where corresponding outgoing attachments are placed

   PUBLIC      Where the INPOST.EXE and OUTPOST.EXE files are kept

The directory structure looks like this:

   MHS - MAIL - GATES - MSMAIL - IN

                               - IPARCEL
                               - OUT
                               - OPARCEL
                               - PUBLIC  - INPOST.EXE
                                         - OUTPOST.EXE

Use the following command to run INPOST.EXE or OUTPOST.EXE from the directory
F:\MHS\MAIL\GATES\MSMAIL\PUBLIC

   INPOST -DM F:\MHS\MAIL\GATES\MSMAIL\ F:\MHS\SW\
   OUTPOST -DM F:\MHS\MAIL\GATES\MSMAIL\ F:\MHS\SW\

where:

   -DM is the command-line switch described on pages 19-21 in the "MHS Gateway
   Administrator's Guide" (pp. 19 - 21).

   F:\MHS\MAIL\GATES\MSMAIL\ is a full path to the gateway directories.

   F:\MHS\SW\ is a path to the MHS directory so INPOST or OUTPOST knows where to
   create its temporary files. This location is normally set with the MV
   variable.
