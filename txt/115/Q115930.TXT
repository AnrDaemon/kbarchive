MORE INFORMATION
================

TBMI2.COM was developed by Novell to allow IPX/SPX protocol applications to task
switch in standard mode Windows. If you are using the 16-bit Windows client
software for SQL Server for Windows NT and are using IPX/SPX as the network
protocol, the TBMI2.COM must be loaded from the AUTOEXEC.NT file. This is
because Windows NT on Alpha-based and MIPS-based computers emulates standard
mode Windows.

After you install the program in the AUTOEXEC.NT file, restart the computer to
update the Win16 on Win32 (WOW) subsystem.

TBMI2.COM is manufactured by the Novell Corporation, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
