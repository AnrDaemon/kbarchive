-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to FFAPI, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) file format application
programming interface (FFAPI) PUT programs do not deliver more than 50 messages
from input mail message files (MMFs). No error messages are reported.

After the first 50, additional messages are put into the Mail database, but they
are not fully delivered to the intended recipient; the message is saved and the
recipient information is stored in the INQUEUE3.MBG file.

CAUSE
=====

FFAPI PUT leaves the remaining messages to be delivered by EXTERNAL or another
gateway process.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can complete the delivery of the additional messages by three means:

 - Run the GET program to extract messages from the database; it contains shared
   code that delivers messages to users or downstream queues.

 - Run PUT again with no input file. Another 50 messages are delivered. Repeat
   this until all the messages in the input MMF are delivered.

   For example, if the input file name is MMF.IN and contains 130 messages, you
   would use the PUT program three times:

   gtwput -aadmin:password -dm -f2 mmf.in
   gtwput -aadmin:password -dm -f2
   gtwput -aadmin:password -dm -f2

 - Run EXTERNAL or another Mail Gateway process to finish delivering the
   messages.

   For example:

   gtwput -aadmin:password -dm -f2 mmf.in
   external
   smtpgate
