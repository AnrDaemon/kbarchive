TITLE   :X400: Invalid Routing Entry Syntax Causes PANIC Error, Exit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you make an entry with invalid syntax in the Routing screen, and exit by
using the OK button, you cannot re-enter the screen to change or modify any
entries, and an assertion message with heading PANIC and the message "Token is
1" is displayed in a box. Pressing OK on this box or using the pull down menu
(Close) exits the program.

Since you should use the Config utility to enter all data (that is, you should
not edit ROUTE.CFG files manually) this prevents you from modifying or adding to
the routing.

CAUSE
=====

Error detection capabilities needed to be extended to deal with this
circumstance.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of being dropped out to an MS-DOS box after acknowledging the error
message, you are allowed to continue with other configuration functions. These
routing entries are accepted when there should be destination MTAs for the last
two expressions:

   a=telecom.canada

   p=prmd <MTA1>
   x121=123
   ua-id=xxx

Detected errors are not corrected.
