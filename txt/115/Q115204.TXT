TITLE   :Err Msg Creating Uninstall Disk: Bad Uninstall Disk...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use 360-kilobyte (K) 5.25-inch floppy disks as your Uninstall disks
during installation of MS-DOS 6.22, you run out of disk space on the second
disk. As a result, you receive the following error message:

   Bad Uninstall disk, press ENTER to exit

After you receive the above error, the only option available is to exit Setup.

NOTE: This problem occurs only when you install MS-DOS 6.22 over MS-DOS 6.22.

CAUSE
=====

Since Uninstall now backs up the DRVSPACE.BIN and DRVSPACE.INI file in addition
to DBLSPACE.BIN and DBLSPACE.INI, more disk space is required on the Uninstall
disks. This problem occurs when you have both DoubleSpace and DriveSpace
volumes, large CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, and you use 360K floppy disks
for your Uninstall disks.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reduce the size of your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files, or convert all DoubleSpace drives to DriveSpace drives.
