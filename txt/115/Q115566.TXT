SUMMARY
=======

The AVIWIN sample demonstrates how you can open and close AVI files in the
background while playing another AVI file. This sample also demonstrates the
MCI_WINDOW and MCI_PUT commands.

NOTE: The Open command takes 1 to 2 seconds to complete. On slower machines, the
playback of one AVI is slightly disrupted if you try to open another AVI file in
the background. This disruption might cause some video frames to be dropped or
skipped.

When you run the AVIWIN.EXE file, remember that you can only play an AVI if you
have already opened it. The menu items are always enabled, even when the command
should not be run. For example, the Play menu commands are always enabled, even
when the MCI_PLAY command would fail. If you try to play an AVI before you open
it, you get the following message box:

   Reminder: Did you Open the first/second AVI? [Yes] [No]

If you click "Yes," you see the error message that returned from the
mciSendCommand() function. If you click "No," the focus returns to the
AVIWIN.EXE file, and you are then able to open an AVI file.
