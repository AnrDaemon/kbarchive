TITLE   :PRB: REPORT FORM Filter Syntax Incorrect on Date Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fox Miscellaneous Products
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are building a REPORT FORM command that is filtered on a date field by
using the FoxCentral menu, the output does not reflect the filter condition.
FoxCentral does not produce the correct syntax for a REPORT FORM statement that
is filtered on a date field.

CAUSE
=====

Earlier versions of FoxCentral incorrectly construct the REPORT FORM statement
when the output is filtered on a date field. FoxCentral places two CTOD()
functions within the REPORT FORM command. Frequently, FoxBASE+ does not produce
an error when the statement is executed. However, the resulting output is
incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem was corrected in the latest version of FoxCentral. The most current
version is available as a file called FOXCEN.EXE. For more information about
this file, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
