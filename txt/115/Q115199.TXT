======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have more than 500 files in the root directory of your startup drive and
you run DoubleSpace or DriveSpace, you receive one of the following error
messages

 - 

   Too many files in the root directory, remove some files from the root and try
   this operation again.

-or-

 - 

   Error Copying <filename>

   where <filename> is DRVSPACE.BIN, DRVSPACE.EXE, DEFRAG.EXE,
   DRVSPACE.HLP, or DRVSPACE.INF.

The error message you receive depends on the number of files in your root
directory and whether or not DoubleSpace or DriveSpace is already installed on
your system.

If you try to convert a DoubleSpace-compressed drive to a DriveSpace- compressed
drive, you may receive the following error message:

   There is not enough free space on your original startup drive, which is now
   drive C. DriveSpace will need at least 0.58 MB of free space on that drive.
   Delete some files from that drive, and try this operation again.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages are displayed when there are too many files in the root
directory of your compressed drive or host drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete a few files from the root directory, or move
them to a subdirectory.
