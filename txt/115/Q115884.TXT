 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following message in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 when Artisoft
LANtastic version 5.x is installed:

   RFC:SFT not in SFT list

This error may result in the entire LANtastic network losing functionality.

CAUSE
=====

This message is caused by a problem in LANtastic versions 5.x that occurs when
loading VSHARE.386 in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove VSHARE.386 from the SYSTEM.INI file and load
SHARE.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT as follows:

1. Comment out VSHARE.386 in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file by
   inserting a semicolon at the beginning of that line. For example:

         ;DEVICE=VSHARE.386)

2. Load SHARE.EXE from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, which is usually located in the
   DOS directory. For example:

         C:\DOS\SHARE.EXE /L:500 /F:5100

NOTE: Unloading VSHARE.386 can cause various problems with applications that use
OLE 2.0 (for example, applications included with Microsoft Office version 4.0).
