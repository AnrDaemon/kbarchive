The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++ 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The App Studio User's Guide for Visual C++, versions 1.0 (16- and 32-bit
editions) and 1.5, specifies that to extend the number of icon types
handled by the App Studio, an entry is required in APSTUDIO.INI of
[IconDevices]. This last term is incorrect and should read "[Icon Devices]"
(two words). Similarly, "[CursorDevices]" should read "[Cursor Devices]".

For the App Studio User's Guide for Visual C++, version 1.0 (16- and 32-bit
editions), the errors are listed on pages 102-103 and in the App Studio
User's Guide for Visual C++, version 1.5, they are listed on page 99.

Additional query words: 1.00 1.50
