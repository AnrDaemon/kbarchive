SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS Help contains the following text about ScanDisk /AUTOFIX:

/AUTOFIX

   Fixes damage without prompting you first. By default, if you start ScanDisk
   with the /AUTOFIX switch and ScanDisk finds lost clusters on your drive, it
   saves the lost clusters as files in the drive's root directory. To have
   ScanDisk delete lost clusters rather than saving them, include the /NOSAVE
   switch. (If you use the /AUTOFIX switch and ScanDisk finds errors, it still
   prompts you for an Undo disk; to prevent this, include the /NOSUMMARY
   switch.) You cannot use the /AUTOFIX switch in conjunction with the
   /CHECKONLY or /CUSTOM switches.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the syntax above, ScanDisk does not actually scan the hard disk drive
surface. To force ScanDisk to do so, use the /SURFACE switch in conjunction with
the /AUTOFIX switch.
