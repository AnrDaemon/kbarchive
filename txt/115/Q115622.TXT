SUMMARY
=======

This article contains questions and answers about the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. Can I include the OLE custom controls that come with the Microsoft Access
   Developer's Toolkit (ADT) with my application?

   A. You can include the three OLE custom controls that come with the ADT (the
   Calendar, Scroll Bar, and Data Outline controls) with your application,
   royalty-free.

2. Q. What is the best way to distribute updates of my application?

   A. To make updating your application easy, begin by creating your application
   as two databases: one database (Data.mdb) for storing the application's data;
   and the other database (Program.mdb) for storing the application's queries,
   forms, reports, macros, and modules. To distribute updates of your
   application, simply distribute a new Program.mdb database. You can use this
   method to update the application without disturbing your users' data.

   All the objects in the Program.mdb database should be based on attached tables
   from the Data.mdb database. Note that when you create a database with
   attached tables, the path to the attached tables is stored in the database.
   If the path to the attached tables becomes invalid, an error message is
   displayed when the database is opened. For information about verifying
   attachments, see The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, "Advanced Topics",
   Chapter 2, "Reconnecting Attached Tables," page 35.

3. Q. How can I prevent users from seeing the code in my application?

   A. You can control what users see by taking the following precautions:
    - Use form and report modules.

    - Use forms and macros to control users' movements within your application.

    - Secure all the objects in your database.

    - Encrypt your database.

4. Q. How do I include my own System.mda file with my application?

   A. To include your own System.mda file, add your System.mda file in the Files
   To Include box in the Setup Wizard. Setup does not overwrite a file named
   System.mda.

   NOTE: If you do not provide a System.mda file with your run- time application,
   Setup creates a new one.

5. Q. Why can't I gain access to my Calendar control's Font and Color
   properties?

   A. The Oc1016.dll file is not automatically registered in the Microsoft
   Windows Reg.dat file when you install the ADT. The Oc1016.dll file must be
   registered in the Reg.dat file in order for you to gain access to the
   Calendar control's Font and Color properties.

   For information about how to register the Oc1016.dll file in the Reg.dat file,
   see Q115125.

6. Q. Can I distribute the Microsoft Access Wizards with my application?

   A. You cannot distribute the Microsoft Access Wizards. However, you can create
   and distribute your own Wizards. The ADT includes commented Wizard code as a
   learning aid for creating your own Wizards.
