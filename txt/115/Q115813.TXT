SUMMARY
=======

The appropriate way to check for a driver's support for transactions is to check
the return value from the call to SQLGetInfo with fSQLType=SQL_TXN_CAPABLE.
Relying upon SQLTransact with fType=SQL_ROLLBACK to return SQL_ERROR to check
the transaction support in not recommended and can lead to unexpected results.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With ODBC Driver Manager (ODBC.DLL) version 1.5 and later, in case of drivers
that export SQLTransact function, SQLTransact with fType=SQL_ROLLBACK will
return SQL_SUCCESS. However, the actual driver may not support transactions.
SQLGetInfo with fSQLType=SQL_TXN_CAPABLE with return correct information that
the driver does not support transactions. This is applicable in general to
drivers that support multiple DBMSs.

For example, Database Desktop Drivers fall into the category where SQLTransact is
exported, and hence, SQLTransact with fType=SQL_ROLLBACK will return
SQL_SUCCESS, though the drivers do not support the transactions. Calling
SQLGetInfo with fSQLType=SQL_TXN_CAPABLE correctly return 0 to indicate that the
transactions are not supported.
