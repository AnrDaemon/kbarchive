======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To assign a drive letter to the Macintosh volume (hard disk), use the SET VOLUME
command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After a drive letter has been assigned to the hard disk, you can use normal
MS-DOS-style path conventions, with the exception of folders (directories) whose
names contain spaces. If a folder name contains spaces, the entire path must be
enclosed in quotation marks.

For more information about Macintosh paths, volumes, folders, and files, see page
17 of the "Installation and Macintosh Features Guide."

Steps to Assign a Drive Letter to the Hard Disk
-----------------------------------------------

1. Determine the name of the hard disk. Using the Macintosh Finder, view the
   name displayed below the hard disk icon, or type the following in the FoxPro
   Command window:

         SET VOLUME C: TO  && Clears VOLUME setting, if any
         SET DEFAULT TO    && Makes the volume's root the current directory
         ?SYS(5)           && Displays volume name

2. In this example, assume the hard disk is called "Macintosh HD:" (without the
   quotation marks). Type one of the following commands in the Command window:

         SET VOLUME C: TO "Macintosh HD:"

   -or-

         SET VOLUME C: TO SYS(5)

NOTE: To set the drive letter each time FoxPro starts, add the following line to
the CONFIG.FPM file:

      VOLUME C: = "Macintosh HD:"

Referencing a Folder Name with Spaces
-------------------------------------

Assume the SET VOLUME command has been issued, and a folder called Test Folder
exists in the hard disk window.

To set the default to this folder, type the following in the Command window:

      SET DEFAULT TO "C:\Test Folder"

NOTE: In this example, do not use a folder that resides on the desktop itself.
You should see the folder in the hard disk window. If the hard disk window is
not open, double-click the hard disk icon, usually located in the upper-right
corner of the desktop.

For information about referencing folders on the desktop, please see the
