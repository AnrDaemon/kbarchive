SUMMARY
=======

The Quarterdeck Qemm 7.03 READ.ME file states the following:

   If you ever want to switch back to MS-DOS's memory manager, simply run
   MemMaker again. If you are using QEMM's DOS-Up feature, be sure to run QSETUP
   and disable DOS-Up before you run MemMaker.

Although this is mostly correct, MemMaker does not remove the QDPMI.SYS command
from the CONFIG.SYS file. As a result, you receive the following error message
when you boot your computer:

   Cannot locate QEMM386.SYS Memory Manager - Not loaded.
