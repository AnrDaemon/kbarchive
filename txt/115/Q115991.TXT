-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro Library Construction Kit for MS-DOS, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, Professional Edition, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Within a standard Windows dynamic-link library (DLL), the instance handle of the
current .DLL is passed to the function through the LibMain() API function. In a
FoxPro-link library (FLL), you do not have access to the LibMain() function.

In FoxPro versions 2.x, you have access to a global variable called Inst. Within
this global variable is the current instance handle. However, if you are using
Visual FoxPro version 3.0, you can use the FoxPro API call _GetAPIHandle() to
obtain the the current instance handle.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FoxPro 2.x
----------

In FoxPro version 2.x, to obtain the current instance handle, the variable Inst
must be declared as follows:

        HINSTANCE Inst;

Once this is done, the current instance handle will be stored in the global
variable Inst.

Visual FoxPro
-------------

To obtain the current instance handle in FoxPro version 3.0, use the the FoxPro
API call _GetAPIHandle(). For more information on this API function see the
_GetAPIHandle() topic in the Visual FoxPro on-line help file.
