The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To determine the available space on a Macintosh hard disk (volume), verify that
files are listed by icon or small icon in the disk window. The available space
in megabytes (MB) is listed in the top-right corner of the window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine the available disk space on a Macintosh, do the following:

1. If the Finder (a Macintosh) isn't displayed as the Application menu icon (the
   top-right corner of the screen), choose Finder from the Application menu.

2. Double-click the disk icon to open the disk window.

3. From the View menu, choose By Small Icon or By Icon.

The top-right corner of the disk window will display the amount of free disk
space in megabytes.

Note
----

If you choose to list the files by name, size, kind, label, date, version, or
comments, the amount of free disk space isn't displayed if the Show Disk Info In
Header check box is not selected in the Views Control Panel. By default, this
check box is cleared (not selected).

To display the amount of free disk space in all disk windows, regardless of how
the files are listed, do the following:

1. From the Apple menu, choose Control Panel.

2. Double-click Views.

3. Under List Views, select Show Disk Info In Header.
