 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Kortex FAX board software has no control of the board-level queue: it cannot
clear a current process or clear the queue of pending outgoing faxes. This is a
design limitation.

If the Kortex board-level FAX queue is out of synch with the RRS.FAX file, you
have to reinstall the Kortex software.
