following error from the C/C++ compiler for MS-DOS under Windows:

   error C2006: #include expected a filename, found 'identifier'

or the following error from the C/C++ compiler for MS-DOS under Windows NT:

   fatal error C1001: internal compiler error
   (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 585)

or the following errors when compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition,
versions 1.0 and 2.0:

   or open the Technical Support help file for more information

version 4.0,

   error C2006: #include expected a filename, found 'identifier'
   fatal error C1903: unable to recover from previous error(s); stopping
   execution

CAUSE
=====

The problem is in using a defined constant to specify an include file in the
#include directive. The directive is being processed before the macro is
completely expanded, resulting in the error.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code can be used to demonstrate the problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: /Yu"stop.h"
    * Previously created with /Yc"stop.h"
    */ 

FIRST.H
-------

   #define SecondH "Second.H"

SECOND.H
--------

   #define SOMETHING

STOP.H
------

   //This file is empty

TEST.CPP
--------

   #include "First.H"
   #include SecondH
   #include "stop.h"
