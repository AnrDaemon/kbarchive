KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Upon starting the Viewer Project Editor, an "Invalid File Format" error is
displayed.

CAUSE
=====

Viewer located and attempted to use an older version of the CMDIALOG.VBX custom
control.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the date and time of the CMDIALOG.VBX file located in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory. If the file is dated before 3/22/93, it will need to be replaced.
This file can be found on the Viewer CD in the \SYSTEM directory.

If the CMDIALOG.VBX file located in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory has a date
later than 3/22/93, check the directories specified in your MS-DOS path
(especially those that precede the Windows directory) for the presence of a
duplicate. If one is found, keep only the most recent copy and delete the
others.
