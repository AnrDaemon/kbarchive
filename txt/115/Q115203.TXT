SYMPTOMS
========

If you install MS-DOS 6.22 Upgrade Setup on a machine running Stacker, Setup
properly updates the files in the root directory on the Stacker host drive, but
Setup deletes the following three MS-DOS files from the DOS directory on the
Stacker host drive.

   COMMAND.COM
   ATTRIB.EXE
   CHKDSK.EXE

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, copy these three files from the directory that contains
your MS-DOS files to the DOS directory on your host drive. For example, if the
directory containing your MS-DOS files is C:\DOS and your Stacker host drive is
H, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

   "copy c:\dos\command.com h:\dos" (without the quotation marks)
