Distributed Processing Technology (DPT) produces two lines of controllers
that work with Windows NT; they are classified as SmartCache Plus and
SmartCache 3 controllers. Some of these controllers require firmware
upgrades to function properly with Windows NT.

The SmartCache 3 line of controllers need to have SmartROM version 2D1 and
Firmware version 5E when you use them with Windows NT. According to DPT,
this line of controllers support RAID 0, 1 & 5, but not on Windows NT.
SmartCache 3 controllers include the following:

   PM2021/9X
   PM2122/9X
   PM2022A/9X

NOTE: A new driver is available for the PM2022A/9X for use with Windows NT
version 3.5. This driver can be downloaded from the DPT bulletin board
system (BBS) at 407-830-1070. The filename is NT351JJ.ZIP.

The SmartCache Plus line of controllers need to have SmartROM version 1K
and Firmware version 3G. SmartCache Plus controllers include the following:

   PM2011B/9X
   PM2012B/9X

To obtain an upgrade, call DPT Customer Service at (407) 830-5522.
