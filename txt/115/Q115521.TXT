The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After declaring the only copy constructor in a class with an access of
"private", the constructor is called when access should not be allowed. For
example, when an instance of the class is passed as a parameter to a function,
the copy constructor is used to initialize the parameter; this should be allowed
only if the function has "private" access.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates this problem.

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: none
      */ 

         #include <iostream.h>

         class aClass
         {
         private:
             int i;
             aClass(const aClass& x) { cout << "private copy constructor" <<
         endl; };

         public:
             aClass(int j) : i(j) {};
         };

         int func(aClass x) { return 0; };

         int main(void)
         {
             int n;
             aClass a(1);

             n = func(a);  //Copy constructor gets called anyway.

             return 0;
         }
