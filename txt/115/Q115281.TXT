TITLE   :Renaming Files Over Network Causes Out of Memory Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you repeatedly rename files over a network, Windows NT may run out of
virtual memory.

As you run out of virtual memory, an error message appears. It recommends that
you increase your page file size. If you monitor Paged Pool Bytes and page file
usage in Performance Monitor, you will see that they increase over time.

CAUSE
=====

There is a memory leak in the server code that handles renames and string
manipulation. Memory is allocated, used, but never freed. This causes the page
pool memory, and thus the page file, to consume all available memory over time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5. This problem has also been
corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
Server version 3.1. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
