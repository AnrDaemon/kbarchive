TITLE   :IP Counter Disappears from Performance Monitor
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Performance Monitor to track the performance of IP counters, the IP
counter disappears. No error messages are displayed, but the following message
may appear in the Event Viewer:

   Open of IP failed. The IP protocol table full.
   Event ID 4185
   Source: TCPIP.SYS
   Type: Error

This problem may be intermittent.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to the RPC service of Performance Monitor sending
multiple load/free library calls to the file INETMIBL.DLL. The file does not
close its handles when it receives a termination call as the result of a free
library.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5.
