OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a Windows NT Advanced Server from a WorkGroup Add-On For
MS-DOS Client, this error message appears:

   Error 55: This resource does not exist on the network.

This happens when you attempt to reconnect to the server after having restarted
your computer without first logging off from a previous session to the same
server. This only happens within a limitied time after restarting your computer.
After that time the error will not occur.


WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by adding the following lines to the
[MS$NETBEUI] section of the file, PROTOCOL.INI:

   NETBIOSRETRIES=4
   NETBIOSTIMEOUT=1500

These values are estimates and may need to be tuned up or down.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows WorkGroup Add-On For
MS-DOS Version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: prodnt wfw wfwg adapter 3.11
