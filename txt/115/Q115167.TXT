TITLE   :PC Win: Exporting Folders from Windows Doesn't Check for Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows does not check for sufficient disk
space when it exports folders. If there is insufficient disk space, the export
will end without notifying the user that it ran out of disk space during the
export. The exported folder file can be used later for importing; however, it
will only include the folders it was able to create before running out of disk
space. The last folder exported may not contain all of the mail messages.
Furthermore, the last mail message written into the exported folder may be
corrupt, which can result in the following error message while you attempt to
import the last folder into another mail message file (MMF):

   Application Error
   MAILSPL caused a General Protection Fault in module DEMILAYR.DLL at 0013:0385

You can select the Close button to end the Mail program and you then must restart
Windows before you can run Mail again from that computer. The MMF you imported
the folders to may now be corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use version 3.0b of the Windows client to repair the corrupted MMF by
holding down the SHIFT key while you click the OK button (or press ENTER) after
you type the mailbox name and password.

Microsoft Mail may not be successful in repairing the corrupt MMF. You may still
be able to repair the MMF by deleting the corrupted message from the MMF;
however, to do so, you may have to delete all messages in the folder that was
created last during the export.

If there was not enough space on the disk to export all of the folders
successfully, you should not attempt to import the last folder you exported.
