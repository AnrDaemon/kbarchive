TITLE   :PRB: SET SKIP OF MENU _MSYSMENU .T. Not Disabling System Menu
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

According to the online Help and the "Language Reference" manual, the SET SKIP
OF MENU _MSYSMENU .T. command lets you disable the entire FoxPro system menu
bar.

However, the SET SKIP OF MENU _MSYSMENU .T. command only works as designed in
both FoxPro for MS-DOS and Windows. In FoxPro for Macintosh, the SET SKIP OF
MENU _MSYSMENU .T. does not disable the entire system menu, but when you attempt
to select any of the menu options, FoxPro for Macintosh ignores the selection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Load FoxPro for MS-DOS or Windows. In the Command window, issue the SET SKIP
   OF MENU _MSYSMENU .T. command. The entire FoxPro system menu bar will be
   disabled.

2. Load FoxPro for Macintosh. In the Command window, issue the SET SKIP OF MENU
   _MSYSMENU .T. command. The entire FoxPro system menu bar remains enabled.

3. Click any of the menu options; you will not receive any response.
