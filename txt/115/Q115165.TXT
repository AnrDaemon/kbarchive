TITLE   :PC Win: Attached Mac Filenames Convert to Windows Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows appends a file
extension to an attached file received from a version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, Macintosh workstation, even if the file has a valid Microsoft MS-DOS
filename.

NOTE: MS-DOS supports a filename limited to eight characters for the name and
three characters for the extension (for example, FILENAME.DOC). This naming
convention is commonly referred to as 8.3 format.

CAUSE
=====

Mail's naming algorithm assumes that Macintosh file attachments do not have
valid filenames and extensions (that is, filenames in 8.3 format). Therefore,
Mail moves the decimal to the end of the filename and adds the appropriate
extension. The filename conversion is handled by VFORMS.DLL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0b and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a.

For information on obtaining this update, query on the following word in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   mailupd

NOTE: If the extension does not contain three characters, the updated VFORMS.DLL
file drops the extension and adds the correct one. If the extension is three
characters, it is left unchanged.


Additional query words: 3.00 3.00b 3.20
