SUMMARY
=======

Autodesk's AutoCAD 386 running under MS-DOS version 5.0 or later may appear to
either run very slowly or to hang the machine. AutoCAD 386 is a VCPI (virtual
control program interface) program; it will access and use all of the extended
memory on a system without the need for HIMEM.SYS.

AutoCAD 386 is the same product as AutoCAD release 11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are four ways to get AutoCAD 386 to run under MS-DOS 5.0 or later:

 - If you are using release 11(c2), run the program NEWDX.EXE found on the
   AutoCAD disk "Dxfix / Newdx / B1_step". This program updates the Phar Lap
   386/DOS-Extender. The new updated DOS-Extender allows AutoCAD 386 to use the
   XMS memory that HIMEM.SYS provides.

   NOTE: If you are also using EMM386.EXE, AutoCAD reverts to the VCPI (as
   opposed to XMS) specifications for memory allocation. You must use at least a
   16K page (LIM 4.0) if you use EMM386.EXE.

-or-

 - On the HIMEM.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file, specify /INT15=xxxx, where xxxx
   equals the amount of memory you want to allocate to AutoCAD 386. This
   parameter allows other memory schemes other than the XMS to co-exist. For
   example:

      device=c:\dos\himem.sys /int15=2048

-or-

 - Specify EMM386 to use expanded memory, which AutoCAD 386 can use as well.
   Make sure HIMEM.SYS is loaded first. An example of choosing expanded memory
   is

      device=c:\dos\emm386.exe xxxx ram

   where xxxx is equal to the amount of expanded memory you want.

-or-

 - Remove HIMEM.SYS from the CONFIG.SYS file altogether; however, there are
   disadvantages to doing this. You will lose the capability of loading MS-DOS
   high; also, you will not be able to load TSRs and other programs in the UMA
   (upper memory area).

Installation and Performance Guide" or contact Autodesk.
