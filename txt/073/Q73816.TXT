SUMMARY
=======

PCSWIN.COM is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that MUST be run
immediately after running the IBM PC Support router and before running Windows.
To run the IBM PC Support software in Windows, you must have the PC Support
version 3.0 software and the PCSWIN.COM patch from IBM.

The following is a quotation from an IBM AS/400 Corrective Service Package:

   PCSWIN allows PC Support Communications buffers to be allocated out of
   conventional memory where they will not be disturbed by Windows'
   context-switching. By default, 16K of buffer space is allocated for this
   purpose. A command line parameter on PCSWIN allows you to specify the amount
   of space to allocate for communications buffers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PC Support is an IBM connectivity package that is used to access an AS/400
mainframe through a Token Ring network.

To order the patch, call IBM at (800) 426-3333. IBM will refer you to an
authorized dealer in your area where you can request PTF/FIX #LF70675.
