SUMMARY
=======

WINMEM32 is a dynamic-link library (DLL) designed to run in Microsoft Windows
enhanced mode to provide support for 32-bit flat memory model code under
Windows. While WINMEM32 is not bound to a particular version of Windows, it does
require enhanced mode.

New versions of WINMEM32 that might become available in the future should not
affect the ability to use old versions of WINMEM32 on a given system. Note,
however, that only one version of WINMEM32 can be loaded at a time.

Newer versions of WINMEM32 will be backward compatible with older versions.
Because you should upgrade to the new version, if possible, it is very important
that WINMEM32 applications do not tightly version bind to WINMEM32. An
application should always use the greater-than- or-equal-to operator (>=),
never the equal-to operator (==), to compare the result of the WINMEM32
GetWinMem32Version function to the required version.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
