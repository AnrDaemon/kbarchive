The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains the ReadMe file, "Voice Form Read Me," included on the
Microsoft Mail version 3.0 Forms disk. The ReadMe file includes setup
instructions and system and hardware requirements for using the Voice Form in
version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks.

Welcome to the Microsoft Mail Voice Form
----------------------------------------

With the Voice Message form on this disk and the required software and hardware
on a Macintosh workstation, a Microsoft Mail user can include sound in a
message. The Voice Message form has two components: the Record Voice Message
screen and the corresponding screen for listening to a voice message.

With the Record Voice Message screen, you can:

 - Record sound into the message using one of three levels of sound compression,
   which give you three different levels of sound quality

 - Listen to what you recorded

 - Erase the recording and start over

 - Stop a sound that's playing

 - Copy and paste sound from a sound program such as the SoundEdit program from
   Farallon Computing, Inc.

With the screen for listening to a voice message, you can:

 - Play the message as often as you want

 - Fast-forward through the message or pause while playing it

 - Store the sound on your disk as an .SND file that you can open and manipulate
   with software that works with .SND files

 - Forward the message, adding your own voice message to the original (if you
   have the necessary equipment and software to record sound)

 - Reply to the message, adding your own voice message to the original (if you
   have the necessary equipment and software to record sound)

What You Need to Use the Voice Message Form
-------------------------------------------

A Macintosh workstation running Microsoft Mail needs the following to record
voice messages with the Record Voice Message form:

 - Apple System 6.0.7

 - A sound-input device such as the built-in microphone with the Macintosh IIsi,
   a MacRecorder or MacRecorder Voice Digitizer from Farallon Computing, Inc.,
   or the Voice Link from Articulate Systems, Inc.

 - A sound driver file that's compatible with System 6.0.7 installed in the
   System Folder, if you are using a sound-input device other than a built-in
   Macintosh microphone. (The sound driver file is available from the
   manufacturer of the sound-input device.)

 - The Microsoft Voice Message forms installed in the Mail server with the
   Microsoft Mail Form Designer stack. (Installation procedures are described in
   the "Installing a Custom Form in a Mail Server" section of Appendix A, "Using
   Custom Forms in Microsoft Mail," of the "Microsoft Mail Network Manager's
   Guide.")

A Macintosh workstation needs the following to play voice messages:

 - Apple System 6.0.7

 - The Microsoft Voice Message forms installed in the Mail server with the
   Microsoft Mail Form Designer stack. (Installation procedures are described in
   the "Installing a Custom Form in a Mail Server" section of Appendix A, "Using
   Custom Forms in Microsoft Mail," of the "Microsoft Mail Network Manager's
   Guide.")

To paste sound into a Mail message:

1. Copy the sound file to the Clipboard.

2. Click to the right of the Length button.

3. From the Edit menu, choose Paste. The size of the file and its length appear
   in their respective fields.

If You Are Upgrading from Mail 2.0 to Mail 3.0
----------------------------------------------

If you have a Microsoft Mail 2.0 server that contains a voice form and you
upgrade the server to version 3.0, the 2.0 voice form will be transferred to the
3.0 server. You can still use the MacRecorders and sound drivers you used with
Mail 2.0 to record and play messages with that voice form. However, we strongly
recommend that you upgrade your workstations to Apple System 6.0.7 and install
version 3.0 of the Voice Message form that's on this disk in the Mail servers.

Version 3.0 of the voice form on this disk requires System 6.0.7. Consequently,
you can't have a mix of workstations running System 6.0.7 and Systems earlier
than 6.0.7 and exchange voice messages between them. You can't record or play a
version 3.0 Voice Message form with Systems earlier than 6.0.7.

NOTE: If you upgrade the Voice Message form on the server to version 3.0 and the
workstations to Apple System 6.0.7, you can use the MacRecorder devices with the
3.0 form only if the workstation has a Farallon sound driver file that is
compatible with System 6.0.7 installed in its System Folder.
