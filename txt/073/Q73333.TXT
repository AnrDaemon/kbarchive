KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Windows 80386 debugger, WDEB386, is used to debug a
modification of one of the standard drivers provided with the Microsoft Windows
Device Development Kit (DDK), the debugger does not load symbolic information.

CAUSE
=====

The module name listed in the module definition (DEF) file and the filename of
the driver do not match.

RESOLUTION
==========

For Windows to load, the module name for the standard drivers cannot change.
Keep the module name and the filename the same during the debugging process for
the modification. Once the file is debugged, give the file its final name.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 DDKMISC
