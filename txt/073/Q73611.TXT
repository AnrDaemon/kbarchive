The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

According to Everex technical support, the only way to upgrade to MS-DOS version
5.0 if the partition is not accessible by MS-DOS 5.0 is to low- level format the
drive. This applies to drives partitioned with Everex or Priam partitioning
software prior to upgrading to MS-DOS 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Section 2.1 of the README.TXT file that comes with Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade
discusses Priam and Everex partitioning software. It suggests installing to
floppy disks and then checking to see if the partitions are accessible by MS-DOS
5.0. It does not explain what to do in the event that the partitions are
inaccessible. Before trying a low-level format, do the following:

1. Back up the hard drive using the previous version of MS-DOS, or a third party
   backup/restore utility such as Norton's Backup, PC Tools Backup, or FastBack.

2. Attempt to delete the partitions with MS-DOS 5.0 FDISK.EXE.

3. If you can delete the partitions, re-create new ones using FDISK.EXE, and
   then format the drive. If you cannot delete the partitions, low-level format
   the drive and then partition the disk.
