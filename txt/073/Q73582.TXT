SUMMARY
=======

If you encounter problems running the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade on PS/2 systems
with Sysgen external floppy drives, you need to contact Sysgen, Inc., to obtain
version 3.44c of the Sysgen drivers. There is a $25.00 charge for the updated
drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Earlier versions of the Sysgen drivers caused problems because they hooked INT
13 and did not report the correct number of drives to the operating system. This
problem was corrected in the new version of the drivers.

The Sysgen products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
