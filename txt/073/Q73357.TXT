SUMMARY
=======

If you are using a Windows video driver that dithers some display colors (such
as a 16-color VGA video driver), you may notice that when you choose a dithered
color for text, the text is displayed in an undithered or pure color. This is to
prevent you from changing your screen to an unreadable color combination.

Applications that allow text to be formatted to any color include Microsoft
PowerPoint for Windows and Microsoft Excel for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Excel, if you format text to a dithered shade of blue with RBG (red, green,
blue) values of R=255, G=64, and B=0, the text is displayed in pure red.
However, if the worksheet or chart is opened in Excel running under Windows with
a video driver that can render that shade of red as a pure, undithered color, it
appears in the colors you selected. An example is opening the same file on a
computer on which Windows is using a video driver that is capable of displaying
256 or more colors.

To get pure colors with a 16-color Windows compatible video driver, select the
appropriate RGB (red, green, blue) values for the colors so that they are not
dithered. RGB values that give pure colors must be combinations of 0 and 128 or
combinations of 0 and 255, as entered into the More Colors dialog box in
PowerPoint for Windows (not including light gray).

colors, the text is displayed in one of the 16 colors listed above if the video
driver does not support more than 16 pure colors.
