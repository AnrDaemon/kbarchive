SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade package is shipped with a backup\restore
combination called HDBKUP\HDRSTORE. The Setup program in the Microsoft MS- DOS 5
Upgrade package gives you the option of backing up your hard disk before
proceeding with the installation. The backup program used in this instance is
HDBKUP.

The HDBKUP program can also be started from the command prompt by doing the
following:

1. Insert Disk 1 from the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade disks into a floppy disk
   drive (for example, drive A).

2. Switch to that drive (for example, type "a:" (without the quotation marks).

3. Type "HDBKUP" (without the quotation marks) and follow the instructions on
   the screen.
