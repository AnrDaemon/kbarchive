The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The BACKUP/RESTORE commands work only with files. The directory structure is
kept only if it is needed. Therefore, if a directory is empty, the
BACKUP/RESTORE commands ignore that particular directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the listing of a directory is as follows

   .            <DIR>     02-05-91
   ..           <DIR>     02-05-91
   EMPTY        <DIR>     06-27-91
   FULL         <DIR>     06-27-91
   TEST     SYS      6458 06-27-91

where the directory called EMPTY, has no files in it and the FULL directory has
at least 1 file in it. When a BACKUP/RESTORE is completed, the same directory
listing is as follows:

    .            <DIR>     02-05-91
   ..           <DIR>     02-05-91
   FULL         <DIR>     06-27-91
   TEST     SYS      6458 06-27-91

The version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference" defines BACKUP and
RESTORE as follows:

   BACKUP   Backs up one or more files from one disk to another.

   RESTORE  Restores files that were backed up by using the BACKUP
            command.
