TITLE   :BUG: Preprocessor Program Invocation Gets Wrong Return Value NMK
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, version 1.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NMK.COM version 1.11 does not correctly evaluate the return value from a program
invocation in a preprocessor directive. NMK will always indicate that the
program returns 0 (zero) no matter what the actual return value is. This can
cause problems if the return value is used in some conditional code in the
makefile. The sample code and makefile below may be used to illustrate this
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in NMK version 1.11. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A program can be invoked in a makefile preprocessing directive by enclosing the
program inside square brackets ([]). The program will be invoked before any
other processing of the makefile is done.

NMAKE evaluates the program correctly and may be used to work around the problem;
however, you may need to use the DOS extended versions of the compiler or
assembler to work around the memory limitations of NMAKE.

For more information on preprocessing directives in makefiles, see the NMAKE
documentation or online Help supplied with your version of the compiler or
assembler.

Sample Code and Makefile
------------------------

To illustrate the problem described above, compile or assemble one of the sample
programs below to create an executable file called TEST.EXE. Save the following
makefile as a file called MAKEFILE and invoke NMK with no arguments.

MAKEFILE
--------

   !IF ( [TEST.EXE] )   # This test is TRUE for NMAKE and FALSE for NMK

   all:
       echo Worked

   !ELSE

   all:
       echo Failed

   !ENDIF

TEST.C
------

   /* Sample C code that can be invoked as a part of a makefile
      preprocessor directive.

      Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   #include <stdlib.h>

   void main(void)
   {
      exit(1);
   }

TEST.ASM
--------

   ; Sample assembly code that can be invoked as a part of a makefile
   ; preprocessor directive

   ; Compile options needed: none

      .MODEL small, os_dos

      .STACK

      .CODE
      .STARTUP
         mov al, 1h
      .EXIT

      END
