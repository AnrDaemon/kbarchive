SUMMARY
=======

Under LANtastic versions 3.03 and earlier, the LANtastic LANcache program
requires the HIMEM.SYS /int15=<xxxx> switch, where <xxxx> is the
number of kilobytes of conventional extended memory to be reserved by
HIMEM.SYS.

Note that 64 must be added to the number of kilobytes of int15 extended memory
desired for LANcache. For example, if you want to allocate 512K of extended
memory to LANcache, enter the following line in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   " device=c:\dos\himem.sys /int15=576 " (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Artisoft states that LANtastic version 4.0 features a switch that allows the use
of XMS memory.

Additional query words: 3rdparty 5.00
