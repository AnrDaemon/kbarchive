SUMMARY
=======

To work correctly under Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 or 3.1, some Sysgen
external floppy drives require Sysgen driver version 3.41 or later.

NOTE: The version 3.41 driver only works if SMARTDRV.SYS is removed from the
CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If you do not remove SMARTDRV.SYS, your system
automatically accesses drive A upon entering Windows. Version 3.44 of the Sysgen
driver corrects the conflict with SMARTDRV.SYS.
