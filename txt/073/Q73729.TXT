SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to use an expanded memory board on a 386 machine and still use
EMM386.EXE to load devices into the upper memory area (UMA). However, you must
configure the memory on the board as extended memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use an expanded memory board in conjunction with EMM386, do the following:

1. Configure the EMM board as extended.

2. Enter the expanded memory board device driver first in the CONFIG.SYS file.

3. After entering the HIMEM line, use the EMM386 statement. Exclude the address
   range of the memory board's page frame.

An example of this technique is:

   CONFIG.SYS
   DEVICE=C:\EMMBORD.SYS
   DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
   DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM 1024 X=C000-C7FF

This information applies to EMM386.SYS in MS-DOS version 4.xx, and Windows 3.0.
Some expanded memory boards may be incompatible with the EMM386 command.
