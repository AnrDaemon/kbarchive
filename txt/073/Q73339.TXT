The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Printer Echo command in Terminal, it does not echo the commands
to the printer immediately.

CAUSE
=====

If Printer Echo is active, all the information displayed on the screen is sent
to Print Manager to be printed. The spooled data is printed when the print queue
link with Print Manager is closed. This occurs when you close Terminal, or when
you choose Printer Echo from the Settings menu to deactivate Printer Echo. This
is the same process that all Windows 3.1 applications use to print. The printout
consists of every line and command that is issued within the Terminal session.

RESOLUTION
==========

At any time during a Terminal session, you can force the contents that are being
echoed to the printer to start printing by choosing Printer Echo from the
Settings menu again, thereby closing the print job. If you want to restart
capturing data again during the session, choose Printer Echo again from the
Settings menu.

If Print Manager is disabled, the information and commands displayed are not
spooled; they are immediately sent to the printer.

NOTE: The buffer is not specifically related to printing. Its function is to
retain a specific number of lines for you to review. The buffer size can be
modified by changing the settings in the dialog box that appears when you choose
Terminal Preferences from the Settings menu. The minimum number of lines for the
buffer is 25; the maximum number of lines is 400.
