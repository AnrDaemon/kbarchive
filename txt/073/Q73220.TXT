TITLE   :Link Pulse May Need to Be Disabled on 3Com TP Cards
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Depending on the hub used, the Link Pulse jumper on a 3Com TP card may need to
be disabled to properly communicate on a LAN Manager network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Link Pulse jumpers are included on all of 3Com's TP cards (ELNKII TP, ELNK MC
TP, ELNK16TP) for 10base-T compliance. Some hubs (for example, older Synoptics
hubs) require that the Link Pulse jumper be disabled. The following are known
symptoms that occur when running with this jumper enabled when it should be
disabled:

 - Net view \\SERVER <= Works 20 percent of the time.

 - Net use \\SERVER\SHARE <= Works randomly.

 - NET VIEW <= Works 99 percent of the time.

A general NET VIEW works correctly most of the time because LAN Manager gets this
information from a list of server announce packets that it has collected in the
server name table -- it does not directly query the net for this information.

Note: Similar symptoms can occur if the transceiver setting in the PROTOCOL.INI
file does not match what is being used on the board. If an external transceiver
is used with the board, transceiver should be set to equal "external" in the
PROTOCOL.INI file. If the internal transceiver on the board is used, transceiver
should be set to equal "onboard" in the PROTOCOL.INI, or the transceiver line
should be deleted from the PROTOCOL.INI file.

Additional query words: twisted pair 10 base T
