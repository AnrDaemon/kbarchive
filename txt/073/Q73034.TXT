TITLE   :Unable to LOADHIGH Correctly After NET5.COM Loaded
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Novell network, you may have difficulty loading device drivers high after
running NET5.COM. Drivers loaded after NET5 may exhibit two characteristics:

 - The driver loads in conventional memory.

 - The driver name is missing, contains only hyphens, or has a nonsense name
   when viewed using the "MEM /C | MORE" command.

CAUSE
=====

NET5.COM is a redirector provided by Novell to update network operations for
MS-DOS version 5.0. It is loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. After NET5 is loaded,
LOADHIGH statements do not operate properly. Loading NET5 high or low doesn't
make a difference.

WORKAROUND
==========

Currently the only workaround is to load all desired programs high BEFORE
running NET5.

Sample AUTOEXEC.BAT
-------------------

   path=c:\dos;c:\windows;c:\ 
   prompt $p$g
   loadhigh c:\mouse1\mouse.com
   loadhigh c:\dos\doskey.com
   loadhigh [drive][path]\ipx.exe
   loadhigh [drive][path]\net5.com

The above mentioned problem would occur if Doskey or Mouse were loaded after
NET5.COM regardless of NET5 loading high or low.

NET5.COM is a redirector provided by Novell for use with MS-DOS 5.0; Net5 was not
developed by Microsoft.
