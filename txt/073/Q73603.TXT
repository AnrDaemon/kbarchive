SUMMARY
=======

Storage Dimensions retails optical drive packages which include the drive,
cabling, and SpeedStor partitioning software. According to Storage Dimensions,
to operate their drive packages successfully with Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode,
the SpeedStore driver SSTOR.SYS should be version 6.4. This file can be obtained
from Storage Dimensions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using the driver earlier than 6.4, writing to and reading from the drive in
enhanced mode will be unreliable, and file damage may result.

Storage Dimensions recommends copying the driver SSTOR.SYS version 6.4 into the
root directory and adding the following line to the CONFIG.SYS:

   DEVICE=C:\SSTOR.SYS /VIRTUAL

This will solve the problem, but will use an extra 32K of conventional memory.

Storage Dimensions is aware of this problem and will address it in a future
release.
