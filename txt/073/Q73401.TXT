TITLE   :FIX: Value of @FileName Truncated If File Has Short Extension
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The predefined symbol @FileName is designed to represent the base name of the
current assembly file. However, if you use the /Ta command-line option with the
Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 to assemble a file that does not
have a three letter extension, then the value of @FileName will not be the
complete base name of the file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The assembler normally requires all files to have a .ASM extension. This can be
changed with the /Ta option that allows any file to be assembled, regardless of
its extension. A side-effect of using /Ta is that if the filename does not have
a three letter extension, then the value of the @FileName predefined equate will
be truncated by one character for each character less than three in the
extension.

The sample code below may be used to illustrate this problem. If you save the
file as TEST.ASM and assemble with just /c, then the assembler correctly echoes
TEST as the base name of the file. If you change the name to TEST.AS and
assemble with /c and /Ta TEST.AS, the value of @FileName that is echoed is just
TES. Similarly, renaming the file to TEST.A results in only TE being echoed.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: /c /Ta TEST.AS

   .MODEL small

   .CODE
   %   echo  @FileName
   END
