TITLE   :Requirements to Run SETUP /F from 3.5- to 5.25-Inch Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using 3.5-inch Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade disks and you try to run
SETUP /F and the following conditions are true, the installation program fails
and generates one of the following messages:

 - The target disk drive is 1.2 MB.

 - The target disks are low density.

 - the target disks are unformatted.

CAUSE
=====

The SETUP /F program requires the target (destination) media to have a capacity
greater than or equal to the source media. This means that 360K disks cannot be
reliably used to create MS-DOS 5.0 floppy disks from the 720K MS-DOS 5.0 upgrade
disks. The problem occurs because it is currently impossible to detect media
type of an unformatted floppy disk.

If an unformatted 360K disk is used in a high-density drive, the installation
program tries to format the disk as a 1.2 MB disk. This does not work reliably.

If the 360K disk is already formatted or the disk drive is low density, an error
message is generated, and the Setup program is halted.
