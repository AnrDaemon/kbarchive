SUMMARY
=======

The information listed below describes the COM port settings in the [ports]
section of the WIN.INI file as changed by the Flow Control options when
selecting Ports from Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Flow Control settings on a COM port are saved as xon/xoff, an "x"
(without the quotation marks) is added to the appropriate COM port in the
[ports] section of WIN.INI.

For example:

   com1:=9600,n,8,1,x

The "x" designates an xon/xoff software handshake.

When the Flow Control settings on a COM port are saved as hardware, a "p"
(without the quotation marks) is added to the appropriate COM port in the
[ports] section of WIN.INI.

For example:

   com2:=9600,n,8,1,p

The "p" designates a hardware handshake and infinite retries.

The absence of a letter at the end of a line donates Flow Control set to none.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a 3.10 wincomm 3.11
