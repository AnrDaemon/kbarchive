TITLE   :Time/Date Stamp Workaround for Notepad
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The time/date stamp in Windows Notepad does not display the time on the
document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To get the time and date to appear on the document:

1. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

2. In the header or footer section, whichever you would like to use, enter the
   following:

   " &d, &t " (without the quotation marks)

This prints the system date followed by a comma, a space, and then the system
time. (This information does not appear on the screen.)

This is a temporary workaround that functions only as long as Notepad is active
(minimized, in a window, or in full-screen mode). Once Notepad is closed, the
header defaults back to "&f" and the footer defaults back to "Page &p".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.
