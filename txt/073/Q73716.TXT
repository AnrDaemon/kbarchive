SUMMARY
=======

To minimize confusion and reduce the number of disks required for backups,
destination disks should not contain subdirectories.

The MS-DOS BACKUP utility deletes files from the destination disk before it
starts backing up to that disk. However, files are deleted only from the root of
the backup destination disk. Files contained in subdirectories on the
destination disk are not be detected by BACKUP. This can cause confusion when
backing up or looking at a directory listing of the backup disks.

Note: The RESTORE command works correctly if the destination backup disk had or
has subdirectories.
