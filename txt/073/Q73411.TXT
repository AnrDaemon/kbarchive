A semicolon (;) in the DOSSHELL.INI file signifies the beginning of a comment
and causes all text to the right of the semicolon to be ignored when MS-DOS
Shell is started. Thus, you can disable a line in the DOSSHELL.INI file by
prefixing the line with a semicolon.

Additional query words: 5.00 5.00a 6.00 6.20 dosshell dos shell
