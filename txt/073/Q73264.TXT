SUMMARY
=======

If you are running MS-DOS versions 3.x with an Ontrack Disk Manager partition
that is larger than 512 MB, the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Setup program cannot
convert the partition to an MS-DOS 5.0-compatible partition. This occurs because
the Disk Manager partition sector sizes are not a power of 2.

If you replace your old Disk Manager DMDRVR.BIN driver with the DMDRVR.BIN
shipped with the MS-DOS 5.0 upgrade and use the SETUP /U command, MS-DOS 5.0
will be installed. Upon booting the machine after upgrading, however, Disk
Manager will display the following message:

   Partition at.... = *NOT CONVERTED*, Invalid Sector Size

You will not be able to access the unconverted partition.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, uninstall to MS-DOS 3.x. Even though you replaced
the Disk Manager device drivers, they will work with MS-DOS 3.x and the
partition will be accessible. Contact Ontrack to get an upgraded version of Disk
Manager and instructions to make that partition compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
