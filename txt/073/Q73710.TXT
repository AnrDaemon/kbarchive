The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to create multiple instances of MS-DOS Shell. There are two ways
to detect multiple instances:

 - Look in the temporary directory. Two files are created in this temporary
   directory:

   BBC6DOSC.BAT
   DOSSHELL.SWP

   Note: MS-DOS 6.0 creates just the DOSSHELL.SWP file.

 - Continue exiting until the command prompt gives another command prompt
   immediately after you type the word EXIT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can create multiple instances of MS-DOS Shell by using the following
procedure:

1. Start Shell by typing the following:

   " DOSSHELL " (without the quotation marks)

2. Execute the command prompt from the Main section of Shell.

3. At the command prompt, type the following:

   " DOSSHELL " (without the quotation marks)

You are now in the second instance of Shell. Look in the temporary directory for
the two above mentioned files. To exit both instances of Shell, do the
following:

1. Exit Shell by choosing Exit from the File menu.

2. At the command prompt, type the following:

   " EXIT " (without the quotation marks)

3. Exit Shell by choosing Exit from the File menu.

To verify that there are no more instances of the Shell, type the following at
the command prompt:

   " EXIT " (without the quotation marks)
