The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When upgrading machines using Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Pathworks or
PCSA networks, you may encounter "Incorrect DOS version" error messages when
attempting to load REDIR.EXE. This can occur despite using the SETVER command as
outlined in the version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS Getting Started" manual. You
should ensure that you are using the DOS 4.0 redirectors because the MS-DOS 3.3
redirectors do not recognize the version number as reported by SETVER.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DOS 4.0 redirector is available on the PCSA Client Setup Disks, Disk 2, as
REDIR400.EXE. This file should be copied to the hard drive using the following
command:

   COPY A:REDIR400.EXE [drive:][path]REDIR.EXE

where [drive:][path] are the drive letter and path to the current REDIR.EXE
file.

MS-DOS 3.3 redirectors are not supported in MS-DOS 5.0.
