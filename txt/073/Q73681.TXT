Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

There are two separate applications in the DDE archive file: TICTAPE and
BARGRAPH. For each application, the archive holds a makefile, header file, C
source code, resources (.RC) file, segment definitions (.DEF) file, and an
icon.

TICTAPE is a DDE server that randomly creates and transmits data about four
stocks. BARGRAPH is a DDE client that graphically illustrates the data from
TICTAPE. TICTAPE was demonstrated at "Windows on Wall Street," June 4, 1986.

To use these applications, perform the following six steps:

1. Download from the Microsoft Download Center and expand the DDE file.

2. Build TICTAPE and BARGRAPH.

3. Start Windows.

4. Run TICTAPE.EXE.

5. Run BARGRAPH.EXE.

6. Activate TICTAPE and choose "Start Ticker Tape".

The BARGRAPH application's main window will dynamically display the (random)
values of the four stocks.

Additional information concerning DDE can be found in Chapter 22 of the
"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Guide to Programming" and in Chapter
15 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Reference, Volume 2."
