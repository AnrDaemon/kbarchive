SUMMARY
=======

The Adaptec RLL ACB-2370 and ACB-2372 hard drive controller cards use a 16K
address range in the upper memory area (UMA). Both of these cards can be
configured for two ranges: either CC00-CFFF or the default range C800-CBFF.

On both cards, the jumper marked J12 is used to set this address range. If the
jumper is set to positions 1 and 2, the card is configured for C800-CBFF. If set
to positions 2 and 3, the card is set for CC00-CFFF. If the jumper is removed,
no address range is used by the controller card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use EMM386.EXE to load device drivers high, use the ADAPTEC.SYS driver, and
be sure to exclude the range used by the Adaptec controller. For example, if the
card is configured for the default settings, the address range used can be
excluded by changing the EMM386 line in the CONFIG.SYS file as follows:

      device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems x=C800-CFFF

Additional query words: 6.22 5.00 5.00a 6.00 6.20
