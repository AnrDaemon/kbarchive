TITLE   :BUG: H2INC 1.0 Does Not Support _syscall or _stdcall
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0,6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft C to MASM Include file Translator (H2INC) version 1.0 that ships
with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 does not support function
prototypes using _syscall or _stdcall. The H2INC version 1.0 that ships with
MASM version 6.0b supports _stdcall, but not _syscall.

RESOLUTION
==========

Page 448 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" states that
_syscall and _stdcall are accepted, but H2INC generates errors when it
encounters prototypes containing these keywords. The _cdecl, _fortran, and
_pascal language types are supported as documented.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in H2INC version 1.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample prototype demonstrates this problem:

      void _syscall sysfunc(void);

When this prototype is processed by H2INC, the following errors are generated:

   warning HI4820: ignoring function definition : _syscall()
   error HI2061: syntax error : identifier 'sysfunc'

   -or-

   error HI2143: syntax error: missing ';' before 'stdcall'
