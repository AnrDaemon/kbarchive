TITLE   :MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Incorrectly Detects Monochrome Monitors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade Setup program improperly identifies monochrome monitors.
Instead of expanding the files MONO.IN_ and MONO.GR_ to the system as
DOSSHELL.INI and DOSSHELL.GRB, Setup expands CGA.VI_, CGA.IN_ and CGA.GR_ as
DOSSHELL.VID, DOSSHELL.INI, and DOSSHELL.GRB. Executing DOSSHELL with these
files causes the system to hang.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DOSSHELL.VID file should be deleted from the DOS subdirectory, and the files
MONO.IN_ and MONO.GR_ expanded into the DOS subdirectory as DOSSHELL.INI and
DOSSHELL.GRB, respectively. MONO.IN_ and MONO.GR_ are located on disk 2
(3.5-inch disk set) or disk 3 (5.25-inch disk set).
