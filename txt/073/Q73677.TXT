SUMMARY
=======

WINMEM32 is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that is designed to support the 32-bit
flat memory model under Windows enhanced mode.

The largest block of memory that Global32Alloc() can request is (16 megabytes --
64K). Global32Alloc() allocates memory through the Windows kernel, which imposes
this particular size limitation.

Adding the ability to process larger allocations is under consideration for a
future version of Windows.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
