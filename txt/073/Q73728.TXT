SUMMARY
=======

There are six switches available in the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Setup
routine, including /? (online Help). The other five switches install MS-DOS
version 5.0 on an existing MS-DOS system. The Setup syntax is

   a:setup  /? /b /f /u /m /i

where the switches are defined as follows:

    Switch  Description
   ------  -----------

   /?      Display Setup syntax information.

   /B      Uses black-and-white instead of color screen display.

   /F      Installs MS-DOS 5.0 on floppy disks.

   /U      Installs MS-DOS 5.0 even if disk partitions are detected
           that may be incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0. The README.TXT
           file includes information on when this is necessary.

   /M      Installs a minimal MS-DOS system. For more information,
           see the version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS Getting Started"
           manual.

   /I      (5.0a only) Installs MS-DOS 5.0 without performing the
           usual video detection and video mode switching. If the
           system is currently in monochrome video mode, Setup will
           default to installing monochrome video files for MS-DOS
           Shell; otherwise, it will default to CGA. You can change
           the video choice for Shell.

   /F /M   (5.0a only) A single MS-DOS 5.0a bootable floppy is created
           that contains the following utilities: DEBUG, EDLIN, FDISK,
           FORMAT, and SYS. This option is designed to create a disk
           useful for manually installing the Upgrade,
           troubleshooting, and/or repartitioning.

Valid combinations of these switches include:

   /F /B /I
   /M /B /I
   /M /U /B /I

   /M /F /B /I  (5.0a only; for more information on this combination, see
                above)

Invalid combinations include the following:

   /F /M   (5.0) /M is only valid when installing to a hard drive.
   /F /U         /U is only valid when installing to a hard drive.
