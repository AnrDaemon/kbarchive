SUMMARY
=======

Solomon III version 7.0 is an accounting program by TLB. When you run the
start-up file SOLOMON.INI at the command prompt, your computer may stop
responding (hang).

Editing the SOLOMON.INI file should make Solomon III compatible with MS-DOS
version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use Solomon III with MS-DOS 5.0, you must delete two lines in the SOLOMON.INI
file. The following procedure uses MS-DOS Editor to modify the SOLOMON.INI file.
Editor is an MS-DOS 5.0 feature; with earlier versions of MS-DOS, use the Edlin
editor.

1. Change to the \ACCT\PROG directory;

2. From the command prompt, type the following and press ENTER:

   " EDIT SOLOMON.INI" (without the quotation marks)

3. Delete line #6, which starts with "COMPVERS", and delete line #7, which
   starts with "IF ERROR LEVEL...". Save the edited file, and exit MS-DOS
   Editor. Retry executing the SOLOMON.INI file.

NOTE: Solomon III version 7.1 is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
