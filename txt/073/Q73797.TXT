-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a system board DIP switch setting(s) reports a coprocessor is installed and
none is present, Windows 3.0 may stop responding (hang) when you insert Disk 2
during setup. (Disk 3 if installing Windows 3.1.) If Windows has already been
installed, it may hang on the opening graphic screen when executed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All 8086/8088 (PC/XT class) machines and many clone 80286, 80386 (AT class and
above) machines use system board DIP switch settings to indicate the presence of
a coprocessor. If the system board switches indicate to system BIOS that a
coprocessor is installed and none is present, Windows may hang when you insert
Disk 2 (or disk 3 with version 3.1). If Windows has been previously installed
and is working before the switch setting is incorrectly changed, it may now hang
on the opening graphic screen when executed.
