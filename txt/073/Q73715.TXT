SUMMARY
=======

The left bookend on Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows version 1.0's main Books
screen is cropped by design. This is so the product can occupy the upper portion
of the screen while still allowing Windows to display icons on the bottom of the
screen. It also allows for extensibility (that is, so more books can be added to
the bookshelf).

Additional query words: 1.00 bookend wbk 1991
