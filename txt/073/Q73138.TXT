SUMMARY
=======

You cannot load files directly into Lotus 1-2-3 versions 3.0 and 3.1 using the
File Associate command in Windows File Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some applications accept command line parameters to load a specific file. For
example, typing

   c:>word test.doc

loads a document file named TEST into Microsoft Word.

Lotus 1-2-3 versions 3.0 and 3.1 do not support filenames as a command line
parameter to load files directly. Attempting to load a file called TEST.WK3 into
Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.0 or 3.1 by typing

   c:>123 test.wk3

produces the following error:

   Cannot load DCF file-run Install

A similar MS-DOS-based error occurs if you attempt to load .WK3 files from
Windows File Manager using the File Associate Command. This is a limitation of
Lotus 1-2-3 versions 3.0 and 3.1 and is not a Windows problem.

Lotus works around this problem with the use of a 123.BAT batch file and an
AUTO123.WK3 auto-execute macro. The 123.BAT file creates a text file with the
name and path of the file to be loaded and then loads 123.EXE. The AUTO123.WK3
file reads the filename and path information from the text file and loads the
desired file.

In Windows File Manager, the File Associate command associates .WK3 files with
123.BAT instead of 123.EXE.

Specific information on the creation of the 123.BAT file and the AUTO123.WK3 is
available from Lotus in a technical note called "Loading a 123 3.0 File from the
Command Line".
