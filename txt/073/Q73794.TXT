SUMMARY
=======

If you install the Windows Productivity Pack when you have a damaged program
group or PROGMAN.INI, you will lose all of your current program groups except
for the new ones created by the Productivity Pack installation. You can tell if
you have a damaged PROGMAN.INI or group file because you will receive the
following Windows error message when you start Windows.

   Group File Error
   Cannot Open Program Group File
   "filename"

WARNING: DO NOT install the Windows Productivity Pack if you receive this error
message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Recover Lost Program Groups
------------------------------------

When the Windows Productivity Pack installs, it first makes a backup copy of your
WIN.INI and PROGMAN.INI files and names them with .BAK extensions. To restore
your original program groups, rename WIN.BAK to WIN.INI and PROGMAN.BAK to
PROGMAN.INI, and restart Windows. This should restore Windows to its
pre-Productivity Pack condition. Once your groups are restored, correct the
Group File error that caused the problem, and reinstall the Windows Productivity
Pack.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows Productivity Pack
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
