The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If the Setup routine for MS-DOS version 5.0 fails, try manually installing
Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade as described in this article.

NOTE: The manual installation does not produce an Uninstall disk like the normal
upgrade; therefore, you cannot easily return to your previous version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manually install Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade, do the following:

1. Back up all of your current files.

2. Insert the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Disk 1 in drive A and type the
   following command:

   " a: setup /f" (without the quotation marks)

   This creates a set of bootable MS-DOS 5.0 floppy disks (the procedure requires
   seven 5.25-inch disks or four 3.5-inch disks).

3. Start the machine with the Startup disk (5.25 inch) or Startup/Support disk
   (3.5 inch). Check to ensure that all partitions can be accessed and the
   machine is working correctly.

4. If repartitioning is desired, now is the time to use the MS-DOS 5.0 FDISK
   command. Insert the disk that contains FDISK.EXE (5.25-inch Startup disk;
   3.5-inch Startup/Support disk), type "FDISK" (without the quotation marks),
   and follow the instructions. After you run FDISK, run FORMAT.

5. If you can access all drives, insert the floppy disk that contains SYS.COM
   (5.25-inch Startup disk; 3.5-inch Startup/Support disk) into drive A and type
   "SYS C:" (without the quotation marks). This program makes the C: drive boot
   MS-DOS 5.0.

6. Create an OLDDOS directory and copy all of the files from your current DOS
   directory to the OLDDOS directory. Then, delete your old MS-DOS files in the
   DOS directory. For example:

   MD C:\OLDDOS
   COPY C:\DOS\*.* C:\OLDDOS\*.*
   ERASE C:\DOS

7. Copy the MS-DOS 5.0 files from the bootable floppy disks to the DOS directory
   on your hard drive. For example:

   COPY A:*.* C:\DOS\*.*

8. If you are using Microsoft Windows, copy the WINA20.386 file to the root
   directory of drive C. This file is necessary for Windows 3.0 to work
   correctly. The WINA20.386 file is located on the Utility disk (5.25-inch) or
   Basic/Edit/Utility disk (3.5-inch). Insert the disk into your floppy disk
   drive (for example drive A) and type the following command:

   " copy a:WINA20.386 c:\ " (without the quotation marks)

9. Update your current CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files referring to CONFIG.NEW
   and AUTOEXEC.NEW located on the first floppy disk.
