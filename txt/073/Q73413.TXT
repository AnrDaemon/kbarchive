TITLE   :Default CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT on MS-DOS 5.0 Working Disk

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the /F switch with the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Setup program to
create a set of working floppies, default CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files are
created on the Startup disk. These default files contain minimal settings for
the DOS environment that can prevent some programs from running correctly.
Before running MS-DOS version 5.0 from the working floppies, you should
customize the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to the system requirements.

MORE INFORMATION
================

"SETUP /F" creates the following CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files on the
STARTUP disk:

CONFIG.SYS
----------

   DEVICE=A:\SETVER.EXE
   DEVICE=A:\HIMEM.SYS
   DOS=HIGH
   FILES=10

AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------

   @ECHO OFF
   PROMPT $P$G

Note that the following two lines of the CONFIG.SYS file will not be included in
the file on an 8086 or 8088 machine:

   DEVICE=A:\HIMEM.SYS
   DOS=HIGH

The two files listed above will provide a minimal DOS environment that may not be
sufficient to run programs that require larger settings for DOS environment such
as FILES= and BUFFERS=. One such program is Microsoft Windows, which requires
FILES= to be set to 30 or greater.
