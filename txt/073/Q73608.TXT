The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Ontrack Disk Manager requires a bootable floppy disk to copy system files from.
Disk Manager version 3.x will properly copy only MS-DOS version 3.x system
files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Disk Manager versions 3.x will attempt to copy system files to the boot
partition of a hard drive after a low-level format of that partition. This
process is unsuccessful if an MS-DOS version 4.0x or 5.0 bootable disk is
provided to Disk Manager. Upon completion, Disk Manager will reboot the system
and attempt to start from the hard drive, which yields the following error:

   Non-System disk or disk error
   Replace and press any key when ready

To avoid this problem, provide Disk Manager with an MS-DOS 3.x bootable floppy
disk.

To work around this problem, you must have a bootable floppy disk with SYS.COM.
To make the partition bootable, do the following:

1. Obtain a bootable floppy disk.

2. Copy SYS.COM to the bootable floppy disk.

3. Boot from the bootable floppy disk.

4. At the A> prompt, type "SYS <drive letter>:" (without the quotation
   marks) where <drive letter> is the partition marked as bootable.

Updated versions of Disk Manager (4.x) are compatible with later versions of
MS-DOS. They will properly transfer MS-DOS 4.0x and 5.0 system files if the Disk
Manager is invoked with the /4 command line parameter.

The current version of Disk Manager, version 4.21, will work with MS-DOS 5.0.
