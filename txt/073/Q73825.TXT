In Windows version 3.1, you receive one of the following messages when you try to
run an MS-DOS-based application.

In 386 enhanced mode:

   Cannot find file <MS-DOS-based application (or one of its
   components)>.
   Check to ensure the path and filename are correct and that all required
   libraries are available.

In standard mode:

   Cannot find the file WINOLDAP.GRB. Make sure that the file is in the path
   defined by '286grabber=' value in SYSTEM.INI

CAUSE
=====

Windows cannot find the 286 or 386 video grabber file.

RESOLUTION

Ensure that a valid video grabber is available in the SYSTEM.INI file under the
[BOOT] section for the appropriate Windows operating mode. The grabber is
necessary for Windows to launch an MS-DOS-based application.
