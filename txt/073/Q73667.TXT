SUMMARY
=======

An application can use the CreateCursor() and CreateIcon() APIs to create icons
and cursors on the fly. The application determines the shape at run time.

When the shape of the icons and the cursors is known in advance, an application
should use LoadIcon() and LoadCursor().

An application that uses CreateIcon() must call DestroyIcon() to free the memory
used by the icon when it is no longer needed. An application that uses
CreateCursor() must call DestroyCursor() to release the memory used by the
cursor when it is no longer needed.

An application can call DestroyIcon() and DestroyCursor() only when the icon or
the cursor is not in use. For example, if the cursor created by CreateCursor()
has been specified in a SetCursor call, it must not be destroyed until it has
been released by another SetCursor() call.

An application can only use DestroyIcon() and DestroyCursor() to destroy icons
and cursors created by CreateIcon() and CreateCursor(). It should not try to
destroy icons and cursors loaded with LoadIcon() and LoadCursor().
