SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft C to MASM Include File Translator (H2INC) can be used to convert C
header files to MASM include files. In most cases, it will convert all C data
types and structures into their MASM equivalent. However, H2INC will not convert
initialized C variables to initialized MASM variables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 441 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" states that H2INC
will not translate static variables, but does not mention that initialized
variables are not translated either. When a variable is initialized in a C
header file, H2INC translates it to an external MASM declaration, rather than
creating a MASM declaration with the initial value.

For example, a C header file of the form

      char a = 'a';
      int  b = 100;
      .
      .
      .

is converted to a MASM include file of the form:

   EXTERNDEF     a:SBYTE
   EXTERNDEF     b:SWORD
      .
      .
      .

This is expected behavior for H2INC.
