TITLE   :BUG: Class Must Be Listed Last in Full Segment Definitions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" that ships with the Microsoft
Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 states on page 49 that "options used with the
SEGMENT directive can be in any order." The BNF Grammar for the language also
indicates that this should be the case; however, if a class name is specified
and it is not the last option listed in a full segment definition, the assembler
will generate a syntax error.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using MASM version 6.0, make sure that the class is the last attribute
listed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code below may be used to illustrate this problem. Assembling the
code with MASM version 6.0 results in the following errors:

   file.asm(1): error A2008: syntax error : word
   file.asm(3): fatal error A1010: unmatched block nesting : data

Because MASM 6.0 incorrectly requires a class name to be the last item in a full
segment definition, the first error is generated when the assembler fails to
recognize the directive option specified after the class name. The second error
is merely a side-effect of the first.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   data    SEGMENT PUBLIC 'DATA' WORD

   data    ENDS

   END
