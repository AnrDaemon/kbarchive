SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to swap out of WordPerfect 5.1 with MS-DOS Shell's Task Swapper,
the computer beeps and you remain in WordPerfect. This problem occurs when
WordPerfect is set in 132 column video mode. Switching out of WordPerfect's 132
column mode corrects the problem.

WordPerfect is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
