-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS version 5.0 and 6.0 can save memory by loading itself into the first 64K
of extended memory, the high memory area (HMA). To check whether MS-DOS has
loaded itself in the HMA, issue the MEM command and look at the output. If the
last line of output reads

   MS-DOS is resident in High Memory Area

then MS-DOS has loaded itself into the HMA. However, if MS-DOS has failed to load
into the HMA, you will get one of two messages:

   64Kb High Memory Area is Available

   -or-

   High Memory Area is in Use

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first message, "64Kb High Memory Area is Available," is usually caused by
not having the following line in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   DOS=HIGH

To correct this problem, add the "DOS=HIGH" (without the quotation marks) line to
CONFIG.SYS.

The second message, "High Memory Area is in Use," has two possible causes:

 - Something else is being loaded into the HMA, such as a network driver or some
   other application. If you want to run MS-DOS in the HMA instead of the
   program that is currently using it, you must disable the ability of the other
   program to use the HMA. Consult that program's documentation for the disable
   procedure. Then, you will need to add the line "DOS=HIGH" (without the
   quotation marks) to your CONFIG.SYS file and ensure that you are loading
   HIMEM.SYS.

 - HIMEM.SYS is using the incorrect A20 handler. Upon installation, HIMEM.SYS
   usually selects one of 16 different A20 handlers, depending upon the hardware
   it detects. HIMEM's automatic detection can be overridden by the /MACHINE: or
   /M: switch. If HIMEM.SYS is installing the wrong A20 handler on its own, you
   must force it to install the correct handler with the /MACHINE: switch.
   However, if HIMEM.SYS is being forced to install an incorrect A20 handler by
   the /MACHINE: switch, you may be able to solve the problem by removing the
   /MACHINE: switch and allowing HIMEM to select which A20 it uses.

   For more information on MS-DOS 5.0's HIMEM.SYS and the /MACHINE: switch, see
   pages 610-613 of the version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and
   Reference," or query on the following words:

   " HIMEM and /M and MS-DOS " (without the quotation marks)

   If you are using MS-DOS 6.x, type "help himem.sys" (without the quotation
   marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt, and then press ENTER.
