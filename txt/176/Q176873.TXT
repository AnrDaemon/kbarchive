TITLE   :BUG: DBCombo Does Not Display the "&" Character Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a DBCombo control contains items with the ampersand (&) character as part
of the text and if the style of the DBCombo control is dbcDropdownList, then the
text will not display correctly in the text box portion (the edit area) of the
control. The drop-down list area is not affected.

This problem does not occur with the styles dbcDropdownCombo or dbcSimpleCombo.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, simply modify the text to include an extra "&"
for every "&" that is in the original text as shown in the following code:

      Private Sub DBCombo1_Click(Area As Integer)
      Dim i As Integer
      Dim s As String
      Dim c As String * 1

          If DBCombo1.Style = dbcDropdownList And Area = dbcAreaList Then
              s = DBCombo1.Text
              If InStr(s, "&") Then
                  DBCombo1.Text = ""
                  For i = 1 To Len(s)
                      c = Mid$(s, i, 1)
                      If c = "&" Then
                          DBCombo1.Text = DBCombo1.Text & "&&"
                      Else
                          DBCombo1.Text = DBCombo1.Text & c
                      End If
                  Next
              End If
          End If

      End Sub

         RecordSource = "Table1"

4. Add a DBCombo control to Form1 and set the following properties:

         RowSource = "Data1"
         ListField = "Field1"
