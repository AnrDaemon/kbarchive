PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix kbinfo kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The route table on your Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) server is not
updated with routes from external autonomous systems (AS); however, the link
state database (LSDB) is updated properly and should cause no routing issues.

CAUSE
=====

RRAS will only update its route table with external AS routes after it has
received one or more non-AS routes, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
version 2 for Internet Protocol announcements, Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) routes, or static routes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
