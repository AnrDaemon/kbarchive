TITLE   :PRB: MSRDO20.OCX Not Registered When Running Application Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running an application that uses Remote Data Objects (RDO) the following
errors may occur:

   "MSRDO20.OCX Not registered."

   No errors were encountered when installing the application.

   -or-

   An error occurred while registering the file MSRDO20.DLL MSRDC20.OCX

CAUSE
=====

In order for RDO to be properly registered, ODBC must be installed prior to
installing the Visual Basic application.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install ODBC prior to installing the Visual Basic application that uses RDO. On
the Visual Basic Product CD-ROM in the \ODBC directory is an application that
will install ODBC. For Visual Studio, Disk One \VB\ODBC is the location. The
ODBC installation program and it components are re-distributable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem also occurs in Visual Basic 4.0 when using MSRDO32.DLL. ODBC must
be installed first.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an application that includes MSRDO20.

2. Run the application Setup Wizard to produce setup images.

3. Install the application on a computer that does not have ODBC installed.

4. Run the application.
