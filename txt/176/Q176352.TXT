KEYWORDS:kbole kbSSafe500bug kbSSafe600fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use ActiveX automation to programmatically control Visual SourceSafe,
the VSSItem object does not handle strings longer than 128 characters. When you
try to specify a Visual SourceSafe path greater than 128 characters, an error
occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is possible to work around this problem by programmatically performing a
recursion through the Visual SourceSafe tree and moving down to the specific
item you want.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual SourceSafe
version 6.0 for Windows.
