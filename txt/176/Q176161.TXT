TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange 5.5 Can Disallow Auto Forwarding to the Internet
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0, administrators can prevent users from
sending Out-Of-Office (OOF) messages and AutoReplies to Internet addresses.
However, administrators cannot prevent users from auto-forwarding messages to
Internet addresses.

In Exchange Server version 5.5, administrators can configure the Exchange Server
Internet Mail Service so that auto-forwarded messages are not delivered through
the Internet Mail Service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Server Administrator program has two checkboxes for the Internet
Mail Service, on a global and per-domain basis, to prevent users from sending
AutoReplies and Out-Of-Office messages. If you click to select the Disable
AutoReply check box, AutoForwards are also disabled. Previously, auto-forwarded
messages were not detected because there were no special message classes or
properties on the envelope, as there are for AutoReplies and OOF messages. The
Exchange Server 5.5 information store is modified to promote the
PR_AUTO_FORWARDED property to the envelope. If this property is present, and the
given domain has disabled AutoReplies, the Internet Mail Service discards the
Auto Reply message.
