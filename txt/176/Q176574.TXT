======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users are logged on to a CICS application via the TN3270(E) server. The CICS
application frequently writes data to the user's terminal. At random times,
users are suddenly disconnected and have to log on again.

The SNA Server computer's application log shows Event 309:

   WRITE failed with LUA_UNSUCCESSFUL/LUA_RSP_CORRELATION_ERROR

A trace will show the user's session ended with a TERM-SELF and UNBIND.

CAUSE
=====

An unusual sequence of messages results in correlation errors being received
from the SNA Server service. The TN3270(E) service treats the correlation errors
as fatal errors, resulting in the sessions being disconnected.

STATUS
======

The TN3270(E) service has been updated so that the correlation error is not
handled as a fatal error. This change allows the TN3270 session to be maintained
when this error occurs.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
Service Pack 1, 2.11 Service Pack 2, 3.0, 3.0 Service Pack 1, and 3.0 Service
Pack 2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
