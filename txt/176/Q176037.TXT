TITLE   :XWEB: Blank To: Line When Deleting Recurring Appointment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, a recurring meeting request is
created and saved, but not sent. The meeting request is later opened and the
user enters one or more names on the To: line and sends the meeting request. If
the user now opens the meeting request and selects the Delete Series button, the
following message is displayed:

   The attendees have not been notified that this meeting has been
   canceled. Press 'OK' to notify the attendees or 'Cancel' to
   delete the meeting without notification.

If the user selects OK, then the resulting cancellation message will have a blank
To: line, rather than containing the attendees.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
