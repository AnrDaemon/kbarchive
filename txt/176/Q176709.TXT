KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Exchange Server is left running for a long period of time, it
might run out of virtual memory due to a memory leak in the Microsoft Exchange
information store. This can be observed using the Windows NT Performance
Monitor, by checking the private byte counter of the Store process. If you see a
steady increase over a few days, you are seeing this problem.

CAUSE
=====

The information store is not freeing allocated memory properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
