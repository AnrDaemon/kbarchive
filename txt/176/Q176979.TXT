======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT System Event log may write Event 2000 errors with a status code
of C0000056 (STATUS_DELETE_PENDING). A network trace reveals that errors occur
when a Server Message Block (SMB) C transact2 Findnext file returns an invalid
handle. This error condition can result when you use the DELTREE command from a
DOS or Windows 95 client.

CAUSE
=====

Applications that do not or cannot use the CloseSearch SMB (DOS applications or
older applications that do not make Win32 calls) do not have a method for
closing searches after they complete. In order to handle this situation, the
LanmanServer service uses several search time parameters to clear the search
handle and reclaim the memory allocated to the search buffers.

For a complete discussion on these and other parameters, please see the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q165815 How To Troubleshoot Event ID 2009 Errors

RESOLUTION
==========

The only resolution is to use a client that uses the Win32 API and properly
handles the CloseSearch SMB. For example, the Windows NT Workstation "del
directory_name /s" command does not have this problem.

For DOS or Windows 95 clients using the DELTREE command, an Event 2000 may be
written to the System Event log. These errors may be ignored as the server
recovers from the error properly.
