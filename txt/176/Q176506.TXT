TITLE   :Radius Accounting Only Logs One Entry for Multilink Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbinterop kbnetwork _IK12469

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Routing and Remote Access service (RRAS) update with RADIUS
authentication and accounting, your RADIUS server will only log one entry even
when a multilink Remote Access Service (RAS) client connects.

CAUSE
=====

The RRAS server is only sending one accounting log when a multilink client
connects to it, instead of sending one accounting log for each port the client
is using. For example, the RRAS server should have two accounting logs for a RAS
client when it connects using ISDN at 128 Kbps (64 Kbps x 2).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Routing and Remote Access Update
for Windows NT Server version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the Routing
& Remote Access Service Hotfix Update. You can obtain this update from
Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet at the following location:
