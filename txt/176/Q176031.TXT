SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT Server 4.0 with File and Print Services for NetWare, the
following stop error message may appear in Fpnwsrv.sys during a burst mode
read:

   STOP: 0x0000003F (0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000)

CAUSE
=====

In certain error conditions, Fpnwsrv.sys does not unmap a nonpaged MDL when it
is finished using it. This error can occur during large burst reads when a file
is closed before the read is complete.
