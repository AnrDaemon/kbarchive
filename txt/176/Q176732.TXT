TITLE   :PRB: Read-Only Files in Shadow Folder Are Not Updated
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0a,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe kbSSExplorer

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Files that are marked read-only in a shadow folder are not updated if the "Set
read-only flag for all files" check box is not selected.

CAUSE
=====

In the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, the "Set read-only flag for all files"
check box is selected by default on the Shadow Folders tab under the
Tools/Options menu. This allows Visual SourceSafe to mark files as read- only in
the shadow folder. It also allows Visual SourceSafe to modify the contents of
read-only files in the shadow directory when files are checked in.

If the file in the shadow directory is marked read-only and the "Set read- only
flag for all files" check box is not selected, the error "access to file
<Shadow location>\<filename> denied" occurs and the contents of the
file in the shadow directory are not updated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that files in the shadow directory are not marked read-only if you are
not using the "Set read-only flag for all files" flag.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project and add files, or use an existing project in Visual
   SourceSafe.

2. In the Visual SourceSafe Administrator (ssadmin.exe), on the Tools menu click
   Options, click the Shadow Folders tab, and then set a shadow folder for the
   project referred to in Step 1.

3. Clear the "Set read-only flag for all files" check box.

4. Make sure the shadow directory is populated (this should happen
   automatically). You may have to do a get of the project files to the shadow
   folder.

5. Using the Windows Explorer or the attrib command, make the files in the
   shadow directory read-only.

6. Check out a files, make a change, and then check in a file in the project.
   You will see the error "Access to file <Path to Shadow
   Dir>\<filename> denied."
