-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Circle method to print circles or the Line method to print
rectangles, the circles do not print as transparent so that overlapped portions
of the shapes appear. The problem occurs even when the FillStyle property of the
Printer object is set to Transparent (1).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when using the Line or Circle methods on Windows 95, Windows
98, or Windows Me.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, toggle the FillStyle property of the Printer object
prior to using the Line or Circle method to print as transparent graphical
objects:

      Printer.FillStyle = 2
      Printer.Print ""
      Printer.FillStyle = 1

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Add the following code to the Click event of Command1:

         'Print concentric circles
         Dim i as Integer
         For i=100 to 1000 Step 100
            Printer.Circle (1000,1000), i
         Next

         'Print 10 rectangles
         For i=100 to 1000 Step 100
            Printer.Line (5000, 1000) - (5000 + i, 1000 + i), , B
         Next

         Printer.Enddoc

4. Press the F5 key to run the project. Click Command1 to print. In the output,
   note that only the outer circle appears instead of ten concentric circles as
   you would expect.

5. To apply the workaround, add the following code to the Form_Load event of
   Form1:

         Printer.FillStyle = 2
         Printer.Print " "
         Printer.FillStyle = 1
