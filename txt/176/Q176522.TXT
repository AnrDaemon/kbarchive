TITLE   :IIS Server Instance Error Message with Microsoft Cluster Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install an Internet Information Server (IIS) node in Microsoft
Cluster Server, you may get the following error message:

   An error occurred attempting to read properties for the
   'IIS Server Instance' resource type:
   More data is available.
   Error ID: 234 (000000ea).

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the two IIS installations reside on installations of Microsoft
Windows NT Server that are in different directories. For example, Computer 1 has
Windows NT installed in C:\Winnt, and Computer 2 has Windows NT installed in
C:\Winnt35. As a result, the Dlls files that are in the InetSrv directory are in
different places and the Cluster Server cannot find them on one of the two
systems.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that both systems in the cluster have Windows NT installed into the
same directory.
