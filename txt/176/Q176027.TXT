TITLE   :Event ID 2026 Logged by FPNW Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinfo kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NetWare clients are unable to log on to a Windows NT Server computer running
File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW), and the following error is recorded
in the Event Log on the Windows NT Server:

   Event ID 2026:
   The server detected a request taking too long for client
   not-logged-in on connection 52, the connection has been disconnected.

NOTE: The connection number may vary with this error.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused when the FPNW service times out a request from a client
because it is taking too much time to process the client's request.

When the FPNW server can not complete the request, it will send a busy response
to the client, and the client will resend the request. By default, FPNW will
send 240 busy responses to a client before logging this error and disconnecting
the client.

This problem can occur when the FPNW server is unable to contact a domain
controller from a trusted domain. When attempting to authenticate NetWare
Compatible users, the FPNW server hands off the request to the local security
authority (LSA). Because there is no domain name specified in a NetWare login
request, the LSA will search its own account database, then the account
databases on each trusted domain for a matching user account.

When the LSA is unable to contact a domain controller from a trusted domain, the
login process on the FPNW server will timeout, fail the login request, and log
the error noted above in the Event Log.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete and recreate the trust relationships between
the domain of the FPNW server and any of its trusted domains. If a trust cannot
be established because a domain controller of the remote domain cannot be
contacted, do not recreate this trust until proper communications with the
remote domain can be established.
