SYMPTOMS

listed in the Instances tab of the Public Information Store Properties dialog
box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may experience this behavior if:

 - You are connected to a server that is in a different site than the home
   server of the public folder.

   -and-

 - You have the Limit Administrative Access to Home Site check box selected on
   the General tab of the public folder Properties dialog box.

The Limit Administrative Access to Home Site check box was added in Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5 to control who can create replicas of a public
folder. If it is selected, only users who have administrative permissions in the
home site of the public folder and who are connected to the home site can create
replicas.
