The documentation for the Microsoft FlexGrid Control lists several constants for
use with the ColAlignment property. These constants include:

   flexAlignLeft

   flexAlignCenter

These constants are incorrectly documented. These constants are not defined
within the Microsoft FlexGrid control and either have no effect when used or
produce a compile error if "Option Explicit" is specified.

   flexAlignLeftTop
   flexAlignLeftCenter
   flexAlignLeftBottom
   flexAlignCenterTop
   flexAlignCenterCenter
   flexAlignCenterBottom
   flexAlignRightTop
   flexAlignRightCenter
