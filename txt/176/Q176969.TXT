SYMPTOMS

Systems Management Server Software Audit may fail with the error message:

examples of entries that may be missing:

   Entries from [Local]

   SystemRole
   SystemType

   -or-

   Entry from [LogonHistory]

   LastLoggedOnUser.

WORKAROUND
==========

To run the Audit successfully, replace the missing entries after the inventory
cycle is complete.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
