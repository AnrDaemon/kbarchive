TITLE   :XFOR: NNTP Newsreader Users Cannot Use Exchange Newsgroups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) newsreaders cannot use Exchange
newsgroups. Attempts to logon to Exchange Server return the following 201
message:

   No posting allowed

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable login, do the following:

1. Access the properties for NNTP Settings found in the Exchange Administrator
   program on Servers\<server name>\Protocols.

2. On the General tab of the properties for NNTP Settings, uncheck the "Use site
   defaults for all properties" box, leaving the other defaults undisturbed.

3. On the Anonymous tab of the properties for NNTP Settings, check "Allow
   anonymous access."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange newsgroups can be configured to require authenticated access. If
Exchange Server is configured to require authenticated access, NNTP readers who
connect to the Exchange Server computer must use clear text or NTLM
authentication before access to the Exchange Server computer will be allowed. An
easy way to find out if the Exchange Server computer has been configured to
require authenticated access is to use telnet.

To test this with telnet:

Using Windows NT, open a command prompt. At the command prompt type "telnet
<machine name or IP address> 119" (where the machine name is the name of
the Exchange Server computer). You should get a connection to the Exchange
Server computer. The server will issue a greeting banner. If the first number in
the banner is 201, then the server requires authenticated access. If the first
number is 200, then anonymous access is allowed. ("Posting ok").

Additional query words: NNTP, 201, port 119, posting
