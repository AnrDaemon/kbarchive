TITLE   :XCON: Memory Leak in Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Exchange Server is left running for a long period of time, it
might run out of virtual memory due to a memory leak in the Microsoft Exchange
message transfer agent (MTA). This can be observed using the Windows NT
Performance Monitor, by checking the private byte counter of the Store process.
If you see a steady increase over a few days, you are seeing this problem. Even
though you are seeing a leak from Store, it is actually in the MTA.

CAUSE
=====

The MTA is not freeing allocated memory properly. The store is showing the
problem because it is calling a function exported from the MTA.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
