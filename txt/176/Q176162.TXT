TITLE   :BUG: Resource Loss with VB4 16-Bit OLE Container in Windows 3.11
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly kbVBp400 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the 16-bit Visual Basic 4.0 OLE Container Control under Windows 3.11,
a one time loss of System Resources will occur. For example, when inserting an
Excel 5.0 Worksheet into the OLE Container, the first time that sheet is
instantiated, Windows will incur a loss of approximately 3 percent of the
available System Resources. This loss has been reproduced with other inserted
objects as well, with varying amounts of System Resources being lost. This
resource loss only occurs the first time that the inserted object is
instantiated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

5. Start the executable created in step 3.

6. Double-click the OLE Container.
