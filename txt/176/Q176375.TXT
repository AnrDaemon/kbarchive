TITLE   :XFOR: CCMC Shuts Down and Logs Events 82 and 83
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Connector for Lotus CC-Mail (CCMC) logs the
following events in the Windows NT Event Viewer:

   Event ID 82
   An exception has occurred. The information is as follows:
   Exception code c0000005. Exception flags: 0. Exception address 2e3d3d3d.
   Number of parameters: 2. Exception information 0 2e3d3d3d.

   Event ID 83:
   The exception UNKNOWN was caught in function dwCCExport.

These errors repeat 25 times, until the following event is logged:

   Event ID 85:
   The maximum number the thread restarts has been reached and the Microsoft 
   Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail will be shutdown. Try restarting the
   Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail service.

Restarting the CCMC does not resolve the problem. Moving the contents of
\EXCHSRVR\CCMCDATA\EXPORT to another directory allows the CCMC to restart.

CAUSE
=====

The file created by Export contains an illegal section name that is not handled
properly by the CCMC.
