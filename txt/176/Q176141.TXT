TITLE   :Shortcut Retains Settings When Window Size Is Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbui win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click a shortcut to an MS-DOS-based program that is set to run
in a normal window, the program may be maximized when it opens.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the program window was maximized and then closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, start the MS-DOS-based program, and then press
ALT+ENTER. This restores the program to a normal window. Note that you can
toggle between normal window and maximized at any time by pressing ALT+ENTER.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows-based programs contain program-specific settings which determine the
window state at startup. The normal window setting for a shortcut to a
Windows-based program starts the program in it's default window state.
