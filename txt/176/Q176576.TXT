TITLE   :XADM: Add/Remove Exchange Server Components Shows Size as Zero
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 setup program again and select
Add/Remove components, it presents you with the four choices: Microsoft Exchange
Server, Microsoft Exchange Administrator, Books Online, and Outlook Web Access.
These components can be installed individually or in varying combinations.

When you choose to Add/Remove components, a dialog box showing the approximate
disk space requirements for each component should appear. However, only
Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook Web Access display space requirements.
Microsoft Exchange Administrator and Books Online display space requirements as
0 K, rather than their actual requirements of 5,560k and 17,816k, respectively.

WORKAROUND
==========

To display the correct space requirements, restart the setup program to add the
previously removed components on the server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
