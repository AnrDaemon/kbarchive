TITLE   :Adding NetBIOS over IPX Support to Network Client 3.0

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you installing Microsoft Network Client 3.0 for MS-DOS and using the NWLink
IPX Compatible Transport protocol, NetBIOS support for IPX is not available.

The client was designed to use the IPX protocol without the aid of the NetBIOS
support layer in a process known as direct hosting. However, NetBIOS support for
IPX can be added when Network Client is installed over existing Novell client
software (VLM or NETX). If Novell's Netbios.exe is loaded with the existing
Novell client software, Network Client will be able to use it to connect to
other Microsoft network servers using NetBIOS over IPX.

To install Network Client with your existing Novell client software, perform the
following steps:

1. Install the Novell client software and insure that it is functioning
   correctly.

2. Modify the Autoexec.bat file to load Novell's Netbios.exe after Ipxodi.exe.

3. Install Network Client, selecting IPX/SPX Support Driver as the Network
   Adapter.

NOTE: The existing Novell client software must be loaded before you will be able
to install Network Client with the IPX/SPX Support Driver.
