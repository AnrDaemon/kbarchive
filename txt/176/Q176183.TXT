TITLE   :XADM: NDRs Generated by PF Rules Not Forwarded to the Contacts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a non-delivery report (NDR) is received for a message that is created by a
public folder rule, the NDR is discarded and the rule is marked in error. The
affected rule is then disabled as a result. This only occurs for a local NDR and
not those that are generated by remote message transfer agents (MTAs).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, a registry value is available to control this behavior, as
follows:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CCS\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPublic -

   Do Not Mark Rules In Error (DWORD): 0x1 = successful
   Do Not Mark Rules In Error (DWORD): 0x0 = failure

Setting this registry value to 0x1 indicates that the rule will not get into the
error state when an NDR occurs.
