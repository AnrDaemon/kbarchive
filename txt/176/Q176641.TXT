TITLE   :FIX: Do Until Loop Evaluates "True" as -1 Exclusively
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Do Until loop that uses a literal or a variable of type Integer as a
conditional will execute endlessly if the value is not -1.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a variable of type Variant or Long as the conditional argument for the loop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic defines "True" to mean "non-zero." Any value that is not zero
should be evaluated as True. The Do Until loop in Visual Basic 5.0, however,
evaluates only -1 as True if a literal value or a variable of type integer is
used for the conditional argument.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Method 1:

1. Place the following code on a CommandButton on a Visual Basic 5.0 form:

         Debug.Print "A"
         Do Until 3
            Debug.Print "B"
         Loop
         Debug.Print "C"

2. Click the button. This loop will print "B" endlessly. (Press CTRL-BRK to stop
   execution.)

Method 2:

1. Place the following code on a CommandButton on a Visual Basic 5.0 form:

         Dim i As Integer
         i = 3
         Debug.Print "A"
         Do Until i
            Debug.Print "B"
         Loop
         Debug.Print "C"

2. Click on the button. This loop will print "B" endlessly. (Press CTRL-BRK to
   stop execution.)

   NOTE: In both cases, the loop that prints "B" should not execute.
