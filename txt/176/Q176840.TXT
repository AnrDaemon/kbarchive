OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbui fs98 kbimu msgame kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
 - Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a menu or change aircraft in Flight Simulator 98 or Flight
Simulator 2000, your Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro joystick may stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

 - Your SideWinder 3D Pro joystick is connected to a Microsoft SideWinder game
   pad that is connected to the game port on your computer.

 - You are running Flight Simulator on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based
   computer. Windows NT 4.0 does not support digital game controllers such as
   the SideWinder game pad.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, connect the SideWinder 3D Pro joystick directly to the
game port on your Windows NT 4.0-based computer.
