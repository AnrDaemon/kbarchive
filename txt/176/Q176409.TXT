PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Newsgroup public folder may become visible to clients in the
organization after making the folder not visible from the Client Permission
Property page inside of the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This can be caused either by:

   Introducing an Exchange Server 5.0 site to the organization through directory
   replication with the Internet Newsgroups public folder configured to be
   visible, which is the default.

   - or -

   Installing an Exchange Server 5.0 computer into an existing Exchange Server
   4.0 site which participates in directory replication with the organization.

RESOLUTION
==========

Follow these steps to make the Internet Newsgroups public folder not visible to
Exchange Clients:

1. Connect to the new Exchange Server 5.0 computer from the Exchange
   Administrator program.

2. Expand the Folders object to expose the Public Folders hierarchy.

3. Expand the Public Folders hierarchy and view the properties of the Internet
   Newsgroups public folder.

4. Click on the Client Permissions button and clear the "Folder Visible" check
   box for the role of "Nonediting Author."

This will hide the Internet Newsgroups public folder from your Exchange Clients
in this site and other sites to which it replicates to throughout the
organization.
