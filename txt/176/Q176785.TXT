TITLE   :PRB: SET MARK TO Does Not Work with "#" and "A"
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use characters like "#", "a", and "A" as date delimiters to enter a
date value in Visual FoxPro 5.x, the delimiter shifts to the right creating an
invalid entry.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use characters other than "#", "a", and "A" as date delimiters.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur in Visual FoxPro version 3.x.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and run a program (.prg) file with the following code:

          SET MARK TO "#"
          ldDate = {}
          @1,1 GET ldDate
          READ

2. Run the program.

3. Type in the date.

NOTE: The "#" character shifts one space to the right with every character that
you enter. This eventually results in an invalid date entry.
