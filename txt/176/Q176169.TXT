SUMMARY
=======

To install the Internet Locator Server (ILS) on a computer that is running
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5, you must change the port number that
Exchange Server uses for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The
default port number for the LDAP is 389. This can be modified by changing the
port number field on the General Page of the LDAP (Directory) Site Defaults
object at the site level and the LDAP (Directory) Settings at the server level.
