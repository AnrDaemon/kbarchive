TITLE   :XADM: Information Store Stops Unexpectedly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running German Microsoft Windows NT Server and you attempt to start a
service, the information store may stop unexpectedly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the Edb.chk file is missing. When this occurs,
Exchange Server attempts to locate the most recent information store transaction
log (Edb.log or Edb<xxxxx>.log, where <xxxxx> is a series of
hexadecimal digits). When you are running German Microsoft Windows NT Server,
the transaction log file name that is returned contains lowercase characters. In
this case, Exchange Server does not properly handle transaction log file names
that contain lowercase characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
