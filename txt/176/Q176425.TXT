TITLE   :XFOR: MS Mail Connector NDRs Messsage Due to Malformed Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Microsoft Mail Connector generates a Non-Delivery Report
(NDR) for messages that have X.400 addresses that use the '/' as the delimiter
and use the '$' as the escape sequence before a '/' character.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Mail Connector does not recognize the '$' as a valid escape
sequence in X.400 addresses. This causes the Microsoft Mail Connector to parse
the address incorrectly, thereby incorrectly detecting a malformed X.400
address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Mail Connector incorrectly parses X.400 addressing that use the
'$' as the escape sequence to denote that the next character should be treated
as a plain character. For example, an address that look like this:

   /C=us/a=MCI/p=microsoft/o=PSS/dda.type=ms/dda.value=net$/po$/mailbox

is incorrectly parsed. The '/' in the dda.value are treated as delimiters and
values after the '/' are not correct X.400 field tags.
