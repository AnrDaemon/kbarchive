The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In FrontPage Explorer, when you verify hyperlinks for a new Corporate Presence
Web, the Verify Hyperlinks dialog box indicates there is a broken internal
hyperlink to the Search.htm page. And, in a web browser, when you click the
Search hyperlink on the News.htm page, you receive the following error message:

   HTTP/1.0 404 Object Not Found.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the FrontPage Corporate Presence Wizard creates a
"What's New" page (News.htm) that contains a link to the Search.htm page
regardless of which options you select in the Corporate Presence Wizard. The
News.htm page should not contain a hyperlink to the Search.htm page.

==========

hyperlink, the sentence "You may want to search for topics by keyword." on the
News Page(News.htm) should be deleted.
