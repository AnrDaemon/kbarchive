======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.51, 2.52, 2.6, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send or receive e-mail on MSN, The Microsoft Network, using
Microsoft Outlook Express, you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to get the Dial-Up Networking connection needed to connect to MSN.

CAUSE
=====

Outlook Express may not be using the MSN Mail e-mail account to connect to the
MSN e-mail server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure that Outlook Express is set to use MSN Mail as
the default mail client (if there is more than one 'MSN Mail' account then
remove one). To do so, use the following steps:

1. Start Outlook Express. If the MSN Sign-In screen appears, click Cancel.

2. On the Tools menu, click Accounts.

3. On the Mail tab, if MSN Mail is not the default e-mail account listed, click
   it, and then click the Set As Default button.

4. Select Properties for MSN Mail, go to the Connection tab and check that it is
   set to:

   A. For Outlook Express 4.0, connect using the Internet or 3rd party option.

   B. For Outlook Express 5.0 there should be no check in the box.

5. Click Apply, click OK, and then click Close until you are back to main
   Outlook Express screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSN Setup creates a default MSN e-mail account named "MSN Mail." If any
additional e-mail accounts are set up in Outlook Express, MSN may use one of the
additional e-mail accounts instead of MSN Mail when you attempt to send or
receive e-mail on MSN. The e-mail account used by MSN may not be configured
correctly to connect to the MSN e-mail server.
