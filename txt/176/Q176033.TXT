TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Stop MS Mail (PC) or cc:MAIL Address Generation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot stop cc:Mail or MS Mail (PC) proxy address generation on a Microsoft
Exchange 4.0 server if a Microsoft Exchange 5.5 server is in the same site. You
can disable cc:Mail or MS Mail (PC) address types from being generated via
Configuration, Site Addressing, Site Addressing tab on the Exchange 5.5 server.
This will remove the cc:Mail or MS Mail (PC) addresses from all users in the
site. However, when you create new users in the Exchange 4.0 server, cc:Mail or
MS Mail (PC) address types will continue to be generated. Creating new users in
the Exchange 5.5 server will not generate cc:Mail or MS Mail (PC) address types.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design, because Exchange 4.0 does not support a new property of the
Exchange 5.5 directory schema. When you disable the cc:Mail or MS Mail (PC)
address type, an attribute called Disabled-Gateway-Proxy is added to the
Exchange directory schema. This attribute lists the proxy addresses that are
disabled. On the Exchange 4.0 server, this attribute is added, but the list of
disabled addresses is blank.
