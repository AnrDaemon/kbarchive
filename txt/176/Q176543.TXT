SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a Windows NT domain from a Windows 95-based computer, your
roaming profiles may not be available.

CAUSE
=====

During logon, the Windows NT server may return more data than the Windows 95
network client expects when the client calls the NetuserGetinfo() Application
Programming Interface (API) call.

This problem is known to occur when the Windows NT server has the File and Print
Services for NetWare (FPNW) service installed.

==========

95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), and later versions of this file:
