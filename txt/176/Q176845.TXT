-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the reveal formatting feature in Word, it does not display some of
the character style formats you applied to your document. For example, if you
apply an italic character style to a selection and then manually remove that
formatting by pressing CTRL+I, the italic character style does not display when
you reveal formatting, even though it is still applied.

CAUSE
=====

By design, when you use the reveal formatting feature, Word displays only the
formats that are currently active for the selection. Word does not display the
style formats that are not currently active, such as those that have been
overridden by other formatting. For example, if you apply direct formatting that
overrides a character style format, Word no longer displays the character style
format when you reveal formatting.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to see all the style formatting currently applied to a character,
click Style on the Format menu. You can compare these settings with the formats
Word displays when you reveal formatting to determine which settings have been
overridden.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Reveal Formatting button (called the Help Tool Command) is not automatically
displayed when you install Word. To place the Help Tool icon onto a toolbar, do
the following:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize. Click the Commands tab.

2. Under Categories, select All Commands.

3. Under Commands, find HelpTool and drag it to a toolbar.

4. Click Close.
