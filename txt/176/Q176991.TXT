 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) mappings in WINS Manager,
your Remote Access Service (RAS) Clients are registered with the IP address of
your RAS Server's network interface card (NIC).

You may expect the RAS Clients to register with the WINS Server using their
RAS-assigned IP addresses instead.

CAUSE
=====

The RAS Client is configured with one of the following:

 - The TCP/IP protocol and either NetBEUI or NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport
   protocol.

-or-

 - NetBEUI or NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport protocol without the TCP/IP
   protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following methods to force your RAS Clients to register in WINS
using their RAS IP addresses:

 - Configure your RAS Clients to use only the TCP/IP protocol.

-or-

 - Configure your RAS Server to accept connections using only the TCP/IP
   protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue is a function of the NetBIOS Gateway portion of the RAS Server. It
allows RAS Clients to communicate with non-IP or IP-only Local Area Network
(LAN) clients.
