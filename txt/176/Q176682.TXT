SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Microsoft Exchange Server, the system attendant may use an
unusually large amount of memory, causing the Windows swap file to increase in
size. This problem typically occurs in organizations that contain a large number
of sites and is not related to the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC).

CAUSE
=====

In organizations that contain a large number of sites, the routing information
database (RID) calculations performed by the system attendant can use large
amounts of memory over an extended period of time.

version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
