SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information regarding network adapter failure within a
cluster and different ways the condition may be handled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The impact of network adapter failure may vary depending on hardware
configuration and the number of network adapters installed. With many different
possible network configurations, this article covers the three most common
configurations.

Configuration 1
---------------

Private Network, Client Network Configured for All Communications:

The Administrator's guide for Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) suggests using an
isolated network for cluster communications and one adapter for the client
network (configured for both client and cluster communications). With this
configuration, if the adapter fails for the private network that the cluster
nodes use, the nodes may use the client network for their communications and
still communicate.

If the client network adapter fails, the IP address resources bound for that
adapter will also fail. If the resources cannot be brought online, the group
will failover to a surviving node in the cluster. Simply removing the network
cable from the client network adapter does not constitute an adapter failure.

If both adapters fail to the point that the cluster nodes cannot communicate, the
arbitration process begins for access to the quorum disk. The winner of the
process takes control of the cluster and its groups. The loser withdraws from
the cluster by shutting down its Cluster service.

Configuration 2
---------------

Private Network, Client Network Configured for Clients Only:

MSCS handles this configuration very similarly to configuration 1 noted above.
However, if an adapter on the private network fails, there is no other network
configured to allow for cluster communications. As a result, the cluster nodes
will arbitrate for the quorum disk and the winner will take control of all
groups. The loser of the arbitration process will withdraw from the cluster by
shutting down its Cluster service.

Configuration 3
---------------

No Private Network for Cluster Communications:

While this configuration works, it is further limited. If the adapter fails in
one of the nodes, with no other adapter to use as an alternate for cluster
communications, the nodes immediately arbitrate for the quorum disk. The winner
of the arbitration process takes control of all cluster groups and the losing
node shuts down its Cluster service. With no way for the two nodes to
communicate, there is a possibility that the winning node may not have access to
the client network, but won the arbitration process anyway. Because of the
obvious limitation of this configuration, this method is not recommended or a
supported configuration.

NOTE: This is not a supported cluster configuration. As per the Microsoft Cluster
Server Hardware Compatibility List (HCL), at least two network adapters must be
present in each cluster node. One of those network adapters must be configured
for private cluster communications exclusively. See the following Web site for
more details:

   http://www.microsoft.com/HWTEST/sysdocs/mscs2000.htm

Microsoft recommends configurations similar to configuration 1 and 2 above.
Configuration 2 is more desirable with an extra private network in addition to
the one mentioned in the example. This allows for two private networks for
cluster communications and provides the ability to keep all cluster
communications isolated. Private networks may be accomplished by the use of a
crossover cable between nodes or by the use of isolated hubs. Configuration 3
may work but is not a supported HCL configuration.
