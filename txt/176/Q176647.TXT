SUMMARY
=======

When you configure a mailbox with alternate recipients, or you change alternate
recipient information, the change in data may not be reflected immediately. This
occurs because the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) caches the data with a
ten-minute latency; this is by design. The processing overhead required to
automatically detect these changes is too great compared to the benefit. This
process is never guaranteed to be completely accurate in any case, because the
data can take some time to replicate to all directory databases in the site.
