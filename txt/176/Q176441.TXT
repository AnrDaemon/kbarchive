The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.5, 2.51, 2.52, 2.6, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a third-party Internet service provider (ISP) to send and receive
e-mail in Microsoft Outlook Express, when you run automatic mail configuration
on MSN, The Microsoft Network, the MSN Mail e-mail account in Outlook Express is
restored to its default configuration and you may no longer be able to send and
receive e-mail using your third-party ISP.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Automatic mail configuration is designed to
configure the MSN Mail e-mail account to send and receive e-mail using the MSN
e-mail servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, create another e-mail account in Outlook Express with a
name other than "MSN Mail" to use with your third-party ISP e-mail account.

For information about creating e-mail accounts in Outlook Express, click Content
And Index on the Help menu, click the Index tab, type adding mail accounts, and
then click Display.

the following steps:

1. Double-click the Outlook Express icon on the desktop.

2. Click Send And Receive.

3. Click the third-party ISP e-mail account.
