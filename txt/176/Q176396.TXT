TITLE   :XCON: Long Lines of Text Cause Content Conversion Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to send an X.400 message that contains several very long lines of
text with no line feeds or carriage returns, the message may not be delivered.
In addition, an event similar to the following may appear in the event log:

   message NMI0210: X.400 Service Event, severity 14

   (MTA DISP:FANOUT(18) Proc 112) 05-19-97 03:45:27pm
   Content conversion failed
   Object at fault     0600004C
   Conversion error    Database Server read failure
   MTS Identifier      C=US;A=MA;P=MICROSOFT;L=FIREBIRD-970519224521Z-30
   Old content type    2A864886F7140501
   New content type    56010A01
   PDU dump reference  2

In addition, if you are using Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0, you may receive a
non-delivery report (NDR). If you are using Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, you
do not receive an NDR.

This problem occurs when the X.400 Connector is configured to use the ISO 6937
bodypart to transfer messages to a remote X.400 system and is not configured for
message text word-wrap.
