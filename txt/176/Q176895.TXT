TITLE   :BUG: FOR EACH Fails to Remove All Objects
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use FOR EACH in Visual FoxPro version 5.x as a looping mechanism to
remove all objects in a container, only half of the objects in the container are
removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Wrap the FOR EACH command with the DO WHILE command. The following sample code
is the workaround for the problem illustrated in the Steps to Reproduce Behavior
section.

Replace the code in the Click method with the following code:

         DO WHILE Thisform.CommandGroup1.ButtonCount <> 0
         FOR EACH oControl IN Thisform.CommandGroup1.Buttons
         Thisform.CommandGroup1.RemoveObject(oControl.Name)
         ENDFOR
         ENDDO

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

1. Create a new form.

2. Add a CommandGroup to the form and set the following properties:

   Height = 180 Width = 96
   ButtonCount = 6

3. Add a second Commandbutton to the form and set the following property:

   Caption = "Click Me"

4. In the Click method of the Commandbutton, type the following code:

         FOR EACH oControl IN Thisform.CommandGroup1.Buttons
         Thisform.CommandGroup1.RemoveObject(oControl.Name)
         ENDFOR

5. Run the form, and click the "Click Me" button.

NOTE: Only three buttons in the CommandGroup are deleted and the other three
still show up.
