PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

For Far East versions of Windows NT that use DBCS character sets, passing a NULL
LpnFit parameter to the GetTextExtentExPoint API may cause an access violation
(AV). A Dr. Watson dialog box appears similar to:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   XXX.EXE

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x77f52edb

NOTE: Xxx.exe is your custom application. Also, the address may be different, but
the access violation code should be the same.

CAUSE
=====

Debug analysis shows this error occurs the first time the contents of NULL
LpnFit is accessed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the updated Gdi32.dll file, for the Far East versions of Windows NT that
use DBCS character sets.
