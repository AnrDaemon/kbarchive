TITLE   :Migration Tool for NetWare Does Not Create Local Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinfo kbArtTypeINFkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Some documents for the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) state that when
groups on a NetWare server are transferred to a Windows NT master domain, they
are created as both global groups in the master domain and as local groups on
the server specified in the Servers For Migration list.

This is an error in the documentation. Local groups are not created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you select the appropriate NetWare and Windows NT servers for migration,
the User And Group Options dialog box appears and the Transfer Users To Trusted
Domain option becomes available by clicking the Advanced button. This option is
used to transfer users and groups to a domain other than the one in which the
utility is being run.

The error noted above can be found in the Migration Tool for NetWare help file
(Nwconv.hlp) in Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0, and also in the Windows NT 3.5
"Services for NetWare Networks" manual, pg. 91.
