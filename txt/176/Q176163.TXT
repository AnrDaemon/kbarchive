TITLE   :XADM: Restart Services Disabled After Performance Optimizer Use
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusagekbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Performance Optimizer for Exchange Server and proceed to the
final step, a dialog box opens to display the services to be restarted. If there
are more than five Exchange services to be restarted, a scroll bar will be
displayed, but the scroll bar is not functional and will not allow selective
restarting of the services. The only choices are "Next," which will restart all
Exchange-related services, or "Do not restart these services," which will
prevent restarting of any Exchange services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
