SUMMARY
=======

It may be beneficial for you to create your own Domain Name System within your
corporate environment with no interaction with the Internet. This article
discusses how to configure your Microsoft Windows NT Domain Name Service (DNS)
server to refer to internal root servers instead of the Internet root servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure your Windows NT DNS server to query internal root servers instead
of the Internet root servers, follow these steps:

1. Stop the Microsoft DNS server using one of the following methods:

    - Use the Services tool in Control Panel.

      -or-

    - Type the following at a command prompt and press ENTER:

      "net stop DNS" (without the quotation marks)

2. Use a text editor (Notepad.exe) to open the Cache.dns file, which is located
   in the %Systemroot%\System32\DNS folder.

3. Delete the Internet root server entries and add your internal root servers.

4. Save the file as Cache.dns and close the editor.

5. Restart the Microsoft DNS server service.

When you run DNS Manager and drill down into the Cache object of your DNS server,
you will see the internal root servers listed. DNS Manager may show duplicate
entries for the same record even though the zone file only contains the record
once. This will not affect functionality.
