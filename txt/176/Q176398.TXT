KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Performance Monitor to view the User Count counter for the Exchange
information store, User Count may appear to be a large number, such as
4294962176.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

The User Count is incremented only when a license is granted successfully.
However, the User Count will be decremented regardless of when the session is
freed.

The problem occurs when you attempt to connect clients beyond the number of
allocated licenses. Each client beyond the number of licenses will cause the
counter to incorrectly decrement by 1.
