The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 2000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you attempt to play a sound clip or national anthem in Microsoft
Bookshelf, you may receive one of the following error messages:

   Filename extension of the specified multimedia file is not associated with
   any installed MCI device.

   Mmsystem346: No MIDI device available.

You can play pronunciations from the Dictionary, and you can play both wave audio
and MIDI files directly from the Bookshelf CD-ROM using Windows Media Player.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following entries in the [mci extensions] section
of the Win.ini file are missing or spelled incorrectly:

   mid=sequencer
   rmi=sequencer
   wav=waveaudio

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "win.ini" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

3. On the Search menu, click Find.

4. Type "[mci extensions]" (without the quotation marks), and then click Find
   Next.

5. When you locate the [mci extensions] section, scroll down to view the
   contents of the section and verify that the following lines exist and are
   correctly spelled:

      mid=sequencer
      rmi=sequencer
      wav=waveaudio
    

   If these entries are missing from the [mci extensions] section, add them
   exactly as they appear above.

   NOTE: If a line is present but has a semicolon (;) at the beginning, remove
   the semicolon.

6. On the File menu, click Exit. If you are prompted to save the changes, click
   Yes.

7. Restart the computer.
