======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install a Microsoft Outlook client, version 8.03 on a Microsoft Exchange
Server computer that has the Outlook Web Access (OWA) component installed, it
may cause access to calendar information to be unavailable or generate Access
Denied errors on OWA clients.

CAUSE
=====

The Outlook Client, version 8.03 installs and registers Active Messaging version
1.1. This can cause problems with Collaborative Data Objects (CDO) version 1.2
in the OWA component.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program and select reinstall to update
CDO to version 1.2.
