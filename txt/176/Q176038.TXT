MORE INFORMATION
================

Fields are used as placeholders for data that might change in a document and for
creating form letters and labels in mail-merge documents. Some of the most
common fields are the PAGE field, which is inserted when you add page numbers,
and the DATE field, which is inserted when you click Date and Time on the Insert
menu and then select the Update Automatically check box. Fields are inserted
automatically when you create an index or table of contents by using the Index
and Tables command on the Insert menu. You can also use fields to automatically
insert document information (such as the author or file name), to perform
calculations, to create links and references to other documents or items, and to
perform other special tasks.

Field codes appear between curly brackets or braces [ { } ]. To display the
results of the field codes such as the results of calculations, hide the field
codes by doing the following:

1. Click Options on the Tools menu, and then click the View tab.

2. Clear the Field Codes check box.

Fields are somewhat like formulas in Microsoft Excel. The field code is like the
formula, and the field result is like the value that the formula produces.

You cannot insert field braces by typing characters on the keyboard. Fields are
inserted when you use particular commands, such as the Date and Time command on
the Insert menu, or when you press CTRL+F9 and type the appropriate information
between the field braces.
