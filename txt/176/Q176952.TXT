SYMPTOMS
========

Automatically generated messages from an Australian X.400 ADMD are not delivered
correctly to Microsoft Exchange Server. The messages are received by the
Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) but are not received by the end
user. The following Event IDs will be logged in the Windows NT Server Event
Viewer Application log:

   Event ID:    290
   Source:      MSExchangeMTA
   Type:        Warning
   Category:    X.400 Service
   Description: A non-delivery report (reason code transfer-failure and
   diagnostic code invalid-arguments) is being generated for message
   C=au;A=otc;P=;L=97082616584041+20201E53. It was originally destined for
   DN:/o=ORG/ou=ORGUNIT/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=WDCOOB§C=AU;A=TELEMEMO;P=PRMD;O=OR
   G; S=Surname;G=GivenName;I=Init; (recipient number 1), and was to be
   redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 21 136] (12)

CAUSE
=====

These messages are rejected by the Exchange Server because the transmitting
system is including a null PRMD entry in the MTSID field of the message. If a
PRMD field is present, this field should between 1 and 16 characters, not null.
Since the PRMD specified by Telstra does not confirm to this, the message
results in an NDR.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The X.400 ADMD in this case is TELEMEMO (or OTC) in Australia. Messages sent
to:

   C=AU;A=OTC;P=ENHANCED;O=Operations;S=AutoReply

should result in a message being returned to the original sender from the Auto
Reply account. Similar automatically generated messages should result when
sending a Telex message through this ADMD's system. Neither of these messages
are delivered to an Exchange user.

STATUS
======

While Microsoft believes this to be a conformance issue with the X.400 Service
provider, a workaround has been made available for Exchange Server versions 5.0
and 5.5

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
