KEYWORDS:kbfile kbDAOsearch kbVC500bug kbVC600fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The DAO SDK, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0, on platform(s):
       - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The DAO SDK that was provided with Visual C++ 5.0 (RISC Edition) does not
install correctly. A new version is now available to correct the problem. Users
on Alpha Visual C++ version 5.0 will not be able to access the DAO components
until the updated DAO SDK is installed.

The file Daorisc.exe (5.5 MB) is a self-extracting archive that extracts the new
DAO SDK for RISC. Alpha users should run the Setup.exe located in the disk1
directory.

NOTE: The ALPHA version of the Jet Database Engine does not contain the
Installable ISAMs (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft FoxPro, and so on). The ALPHA
version of Jet allows access only to Jet Database .mdb files.
