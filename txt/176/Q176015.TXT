TITLE   :PRB: Running Sysdiff with Multiple Partitions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Sysdiff utility, all partitions have to be set up on the hard
drive prior to taking a snapshot of the system. If one partition is present when
the initial snapshot is taken, then the user adds a second partition using Disk
Administrator and installs applications to the added partition, the difference
file will not contain the new partition or application information.

In the above scenario, the difference file will only contain the changes that
were made to the registry as a result of creating a new partition and whatever
changes were made by installing the application(s). The application files that
were installed on the new partition will not be contained in the difference
file.

CAUSE
=====

When the snapshot of the system is taken, it only incorporates the information
on existing partitions. So when the difference file is created, the partitions
added after the snapshot was taken are ignored. Sysdiff is not designed to
capture system changes, that is, partition changes. Sysdiff is designed to snap
the system, install applications, then do a diff to capture which applications
were installed.


RESOLUTION
==========

To capture the necessary information when you use the Sysdiff utility on a
computer with multiple partitions, perform the following steps:

1. Setup all partitions through Disk Administrator prior to issuing the "sysdiff
   /snap c:\<image file>" command.

2. Follow all procedures outlined in the Windows NT Deployment Guide to create
   the difference package to be used to install applications to other systems.
   Steps are also outlined above.

If there are problems with drive space limitations when applying the difference
package to the installation share, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article for further information:
