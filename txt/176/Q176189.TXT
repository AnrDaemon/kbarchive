TITLE   :WD97: Shading of Solid Black or Gray Wont Print Duplex on NT
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print in duplex mode to an HP LaserJet 5si running under Windows NT
4.0, your document does not print on both sides of the page. Instead it prints
only on one side of the page.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will occur if your document contains a table with solid black
shading.

This problem is more likely to occur with shading of higher percentages of gray
(70% and higher). However, there is no certain percentage of shading at which
this problem occurs. Sometimes the document will be printed on both sides of the
page if it is formatted at 70-80% gray shading; however, other times it will not
be printed at all.

NOTE: If the shading is of lower percentages of gray shading (5% to approximately
65%), duplex printing should function correctly.

This problem occurs with the HP LaserJet 5si driver that shipped with Windows NT
4.0. Changing any of the settings in the driver does not provide a workaround to
this issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 5si driver for
Windows NT 4.0 from the HP Web site. If you have trouble installing the new
driver, contact Hewlett-Packard (HP) technical support.


There are four printer driver versions provided with the HP driver:

   HP LaserJet 5si (Standard)
   HP LaserJet 5si Mopier
   HP LaserJet 5si Mopier PS
   HP LaserJet 5si/5si MX PS

NOTE: The standard HP LaserJet 5si driver does not have the duplexing feature.
