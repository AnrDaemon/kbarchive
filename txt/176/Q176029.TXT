TITLE   :Messenger Service Fails When Using Only NWLINK
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinfo kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When NWLink is the only protocol installed, the Messenger service fails to
start, and the following error is recorded in the Event Log:

   Error ID: 7024  Source:
   The Messenger Service Terminated With Service-Specific Error 2105.

Server Manager fails with the following error:

   The Network Path Was Not Found. Do You Want to Select Another Domain to
   Administer?

License Manager fails with the following error:

   The Specified Domain Does Not Exist

Although you cannot connect with NWLink NetBIOS, you can connect with direct
hosting clients such as Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11. SPX and
NCP-based communication to the server will continue to function correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Installing support for multiple IPX frame types with Windows NT Server 4.0 can
cause this problem, depending upon the order in which the frame types are added.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
