TITLE   :PRB: Executing .Fetch of the VB5 MSMAPI32.OCX Can Hang VB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVBDB kbVB500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application using the MSMAPI32.OCX MAPIMessages Control (version 5.00.3721)
may hang when the .Fetch method of the control is called.

CAUSE
=====

The messaging subsystem of your Operating System may be too outdated to use this
control successfully.

The most common occurrence of this problem is where the customer has installed
the Exchange 4 client from the original release media of Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, you can install the Windows Messaging System (WMS).

If the problem is on Windows 95, WMS can be installed from
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES. The target file is called
EXUPDUSA.EXE. This will update the messaging subsystem (MAPI DLL files) on the
problematic system.

If the problem is on another platform, you can obtain the appropriate WMS from
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/MAPI/WMS_RDST. The README.TXT file in that
directory provides information on what file to download for operating system as
well as installation instructions.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article is not applicable if the problematic system has (or previously had)
any version of Outlook or the Exchange client version 5 or higher installed.
