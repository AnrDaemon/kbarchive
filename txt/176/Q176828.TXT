TITLE   :MSN Sign-In Screen Prompts Repeatedly in Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows Messaging, Microsoft Outlook 97, or Microsoft Outlook
Express in Windows NT to access your Internet e-mail on MSN, The Microsoft
Network, the MSN Sign-In screen may repeatedly prompt you for your user name and
password. This prompt may occur even though you are typing the correct sign-in
information.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using a POP3/SMTP Internet e-mail program and
your MSN e-mail account has not been migrated from the MSN Classic e-mail
servers to the MSN POP3/SMTP servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use MSN version 2.5 on a computer running
Microsoft Windows 95 to migrate your MSN e-mail account to the MSN POP3/SMTP
servers. After this migration is complete, you can use Windows Messaging,
Outlook 97, or Outlook Express in Windows NT to access your Internet e-mail on
the MSN SMTP/POP3 servers.

For additional information about migrating your MSN e-mail account, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

TITLE : Frequently Asked Questions About Mail Migration on MSN


MORE INFORMATION
================

MSN version 2.5 or later. MSN requires Windows 95 and is not supported with
Windows NT. For additional information about support for MSN services on a
computer running Windows 2000, click the article number below to view the
