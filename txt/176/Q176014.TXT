TITLE   :8.3 Short File Names not Retained after Tape Restore
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you back up a volume that contains long file names with associated 8.3
short file names, the short file names that were previously associated with the
long file names may not be retained after a restore operation. This may happen
using the Windows NT backup program called Ntbackup or any third-party OEM
backup software.

Using the COPY or XCOPY command will result in the same behavior of not retaining
short file names. Short file names are always created dynamically. This may
cause certain applications to fail if they are looking for specific 8.3 short
file names to be associated with long file name (LFN) files.

CAUSE
=====

NTBackup restores the files in alpha-numeric order and does not restore the
short file name. The short file name is therefore recreated and may not be the
same as the original.

WORKAROUND
==========

Adhere to a pure 8.3 short file naming convention if in a mixed environment of
clients that are both capable and incapable of using long file names. That way
the backup programs will be dealing strictly with 8.3 short file names and
restore them correctly.
