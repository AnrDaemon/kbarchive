SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to set the default size of an Active Template Library
(ATL) control when it is first inserted into a container. The default width and
height of an ATL control is stored in a variable called m_sizeExtent, which is
normally initialized to 5080x5080 himetric units in the constructor for
CComControlBase from which CComControl is derived. You can set your own
preferred default size in your control's constructor, as follows:

      CTestControl()
      {
         // width = 100 pixels, height = 25 pixels
         SIZE sz = { 100, 25 };
         // convert pixels to himetric
         AtlPixelToHiMetric (&sz, &m_sizeExtent);
         // store natural extent
         m_sizeNatural = m_sizeExtent;
      }
