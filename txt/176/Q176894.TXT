The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a

SUMMARY
=======

The undocumented SHEET clause of the APPEND FROM command allows you to import
records from a specific sheet of a Microsoft Excel 5.0 workbook.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example shows how to import the data in a second sheet named
sheet2 from an Excel workbook into a Visual FoxPro 3.0x or 5.0x table.

1. Start Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or later.

2. Create a new workbook.

3. In Sheet1 of the workbook, type the following in separate cells, A1 through
   C1:

         The     first     sheet

4. Click on Sheet2 of the workbook and type the following data in the cells of
   sheet2 beginning in cell A1 and ending in cell C3:

         The     first     record
         The     second    record
         The     third     record

   When this data is appended into the FoxPro table, it creates three records
   containing three fields.

5. Save the workbook in the Visual FoxPro home folder as a Microsoft Excel 5.0
   Workbook (.xls) named Zbook1.xls and close Excel.

6. Start Visual FoxPro 3.0x or 5.0x and create a table using the following
   command:

         CREATE TABLE zjunk (first c(10), second c(10), third c(10))

7. Append the cells from Sheet2 to the first three records of table Ztest with
   the following command:

         APPEND FROM zbook1.xls TYPE XL5 SHEET SHEET2

   When you browse the table you should see three records that contain the data
   from sheet2.
