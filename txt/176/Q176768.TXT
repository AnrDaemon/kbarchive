TITLE   :SNA Server PU/LU Reactivation Fails After VTAM Z NET CANCEL
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft SNA Server is configured with one or more channel connections
over the Polaris Escon channel adapter, not all of the PUs and LUs reactivate if
VTAM is shut down quickly using the VTAM command:

   z net, cancel

If VTAM is shut down in an orderly manner, the PUs and LUs do reactivate
properly.

This problem was observed when SNA Server was configured with 15 PUs and 250 LUs
each (3750 total LUs). Some LUs failed to reactivate when VTAM was restarted.

CAUSE
=====

There are two different problems contributing to the reactivation problems:

 - SNA Server is not efficiently processing a large number of DACTLU messages
   from the host, causing slow performance in responding to DACTLU requests.
   This may cause the host to experience channel timeout errors during LU
   deactivation. This problem was fixed in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2),
   though was not listed in the 3.0 SP2 fix list Help file.

 - The Polaris link service is not responding quickly to SNA Server Close(Link)
   requests, causing the host to experience channel errors when attempting to
   reactivate the PUs and LUs when the host was brought back up again.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Stop VTAM using an orderly shutdown method, instead of using the "z net,
   cancel" option.

   -OR-

 - Try disabling the channel PUs first

   v net, id=xxxx,inact,f

   before issuing the "z net, cancel ..." command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the SNA Server version 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1) and 3.0 SP2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

With this fix applied, SNA Server 3.0 was successfully tested with 15,000 LUs
(the maximum LU capacity supported by SNA Server 3.0) over a single Polaris
ESCON adapter (60 PUs, each with 250 LUs).

The fix described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article should also
be applied when using SNA Server with thousands of 3270 or LUA LUs:
