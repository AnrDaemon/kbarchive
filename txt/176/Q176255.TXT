 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the TAB key to select a media type on the Find Media tab in
Microsoft Bookshelf 98, you may have difficulty determining which media type you
selected. Because the box used to indicate focus is very similar in color to the
window background, you may have difficulty distinguishing the selected media
type from the window background.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf 98. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
