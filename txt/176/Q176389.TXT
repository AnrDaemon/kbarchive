TITLE   :PPT7: Embed TrueType Fonts in PowerPoint Windows Metafiles
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbconversion kbFont

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save to Windows Metafile in Microsoft PowerPoint 7.0, you have an
option box that enables you to select whether you want to embed TrueType fonts.
In PowerPoint 4.0 and PowerPoint 97, the Embed TrueType option box is
unavailable (dimmed).

CAUSE
=====

This option box should not be available in PowerPoint 7.0. This command does not
embed TrueType fonts when you save to Windows Metafiles because Windows
Metafiles do not use font embedding.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
PowerPoint 97.
