PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the ColumnLabel property of an MSChart control at run-time, the
text in the legend appears truncated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this property, you can change the legend text at run-time by
setting the LegendText property of the Series:

      MSChart1.Plot.SeriesCollection(1).LegendText = "My Legend Text"

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Click Components on the Project menu, and check "Microsoft Chart Control."

3. Add an MSChart control to Form1.

4. Set the ShowLegend property of MSChart1 to True.

5. Add the following code to the Load event of Form1:

         Dim i as Integer
         For i = 1 To MSChart1.Plot.SeriesCollection.Count
            MSChart1.Column = i
            MSChart1.ColumnLabel = "Legend Text " & i
         Next

6. Press the F5 key to run the project. Note that the text in the legend is
   truncated.

To work around the problem with this example, change the following line of code:

      MSChart1.ColumnLabel = "Legend Text " & i

to:

      MSChart1.Plot.SeriesCollection(i).LegendText = "Legend Text " & i
