The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

Clients logging on and attempting to change their password receive the following
error:

   Unable to change the password on this account (C00000BE).
   Please consult your system administrator.

Event Viewer Security log shows Event ID 577 - Security-Failure. Audit-Privilege.

CAUSE
=====

C00000BE indicates STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_PATH. When users change passwords, they
connect directly to the primary domain controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Check physical connectivity by pinging the primary domain controller by IP
   address and name.

 - Check connectivity through NET USE * \\PDCNAME\Share at an MS-DOS command
   prompt.

 - Review entries in the primary and secondary WINS servers for inaccurate
   records.

 - Under User Manager for Domains, Policies, Account, click to clear the "Users
   must log on in order to change password" check box.

 - RestrictAnonymous has been set to 1 on the PDC, which prevents the user from
   connecting to the PDC with a Null Session from the client workstation. The
   user will not be able to change his or her password before he or she logs on
   to the domain. The user can change his or her password after he or she logs
   on to the domain because he or she will not be connecting to the PDC with a
   null session at that time; the user domain credentials will be passed to the
   PDC while trying to set up the session.
