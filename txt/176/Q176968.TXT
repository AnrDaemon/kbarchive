======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to boot a Windows NT-based computer with a Windows NT File
System (NTFS) system partition, your computer may hang after the Power On Self
Test (POST), and you may receive the following error message:

   A kernel file is missing from the disk.
   Insert a system disk and restart the system.


NOTE: This article only applies to Intel-based computers with an NTFS primary
bootable partition.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the NTFS disk structure data contained in the Master
File Table (MFT) is damaged or fragmented, preventing the Windows NT boot loader
(Ntldr) from being located or read.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Using the MS-DOS-based Fdisk utility, verify the system partition is the
   active partition. For information about how to do so, consult the
   documentation included with MS-DOS. If this does not resolve the issue,
   continue with step 2.

2. Attempt to repair the Ntldr file. For information about how to do so, please
   see the following article Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q155892
   TITLE : Windows NT Boot Problem: Kernel File Is Missing From the Disk

   If this does not resolve the issue, continue with step 3.

3. Use an anti-virus program to check for a boot sector virus. For information
   about how to do so, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q122221
   TITLE : How to Protect Boot Sector from Viruses in Windows NT

   If this does not resolve the issue, continue with step 4.

4. You may be able to access the system partition using a Windows NT boot disk.
   If you can access the system partition, you can create a backup of essential
   data files and reinstall Windows NT. For information about how to create a
   Windows NT boot disk, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q119467
   TITLE : Creating a Boot Disk for an NTFS or FAT Partition.

   NOTE: If you cannot access the system partition using a Windows NT boot disk,
   the NTFS MFT may be damaged, and the NTFS partition may need to be
   reformatted.
