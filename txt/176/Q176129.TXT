TITLE   :XCON: Cannot Reply to Messages from User with Dual DDA Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to reply to a message that originates from a Defense Messaging
System (DMS) user whose mailbox has dual DDA fields defined in its X.400
address, your reply is not received. Also, no non-delivery report (NDR) is
generated.

CAUSE
=====

When dual DDAs are used, the DDA does not get mapped into the X.500
Distinguished Name (DN); it stays in the DDA field. Consequently, no DN exists
on the originator. In actuality, there is a DDA that is unknown to the
originator of the message.

The lack of an NDR in DMS occurs because the incoming reply is dropped at the
Multi-Function Interpreter (MFI), because there is no resolvable address. The
MFI, also referred to as Multifunction Gateway (MFG) allows the translation of
messages from one format to another. All connectivity outside of DMS must go
through the MFI so the message can be downgraded to a non-DMS compliant message.
The MFI provides gateway translation between mail systems, including AUTODIN
(JANAP128), ACP123 with P42 and P772, ACP127 (NATO's version of AUTODIN), SMTP
RFC822, SMTP/MSP, X.400 P2 and P22, and other legacy systems as required.

STATUS
======

version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
