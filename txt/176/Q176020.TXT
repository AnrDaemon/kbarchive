-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If SNA Server is configured to support up to 15000 3270 LUs, it may take several
minutes to start the SNA Server service and for the LUs to change to an
available status.


CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server service is not processing ACTLUs efficiently, causing performance
delays when a large number of 3270 LUs are configured.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1, and 3.0 Service Pack 2. This problem was corrected in SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack 3. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
