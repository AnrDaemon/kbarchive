TITLE   :XADM: Address Book Views Do Not Replicate Between Sites
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0, Address Book Views (ABVs) may not replicate
intersite, if parent ABV containers are deleted prior to the deletion of child
ABV containers.

CAUSE
=====

This situation may occur if the mail based (INTER-SITE) replication message
containing the delete of the parent ABV container is processed before the
replication message that deletes the child ABV container. A cause for this could
be delayed message transfer between sites due to network congestion.

   Address Book Views
        +--PARENT (by Business Unit)
           |
           |
           CHILD (by Dept)
        +--PARENT2 (by Country) - from SITE2
           |
           |
           CHILD2 (by City) - from SITE2

For example, if the (by Dept) child ABV view is active (contains valid entries)
and the (by Business Unit) parent ABV is deleted, then Intersite replication of
(by Country) - from SITE 2 could fail.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Directory replication is restored between sites by un-deleting the parent ABV
containers if replication messages are received for child ABV containers
containing valid members.
