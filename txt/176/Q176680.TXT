The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Linkage 3.2 to move mail between a Microsoft Exchange Server system
and a PROFS system, you may experience problems with unwanted users being cc'd
when mail is forwarded to an Exchange user from PROFS. These unwanted users were
cc'd in the original PROFS email.

CAUSE
=====

The PROFS Connector detects original CC: line embedded in the forwarded message
as the CC: line for the message forwarded to the Exchange user.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install the latest Linkage patch. It modifies the PROFS connector to allow it to
detect the real PROFS NOTE CC: list if the message forwarded contains the
embedded CC: list from the original message. After the patch is installed, the
embedded CC: list's recipients will be skipped and the real CC: list will be
mapped as Exchange P2 recipients.
