to place the macro and its shortcut key assignment on a menu or toolbar:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize. Click the Commands tab, and under
   Categories, select Macros.

2. Under Commands, find your macro and drag it to a menu or toolbar.

3. Click Modify Selection, click in the Name box, and then change, if necessary,
   the name of the macro. Following the name of the macro, type in the shortcut
   key assignment.

4. Click Close on the Customize dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION

Any built-in Word commands that display shortcut keys on menus or in screen tips
will automatically show key assignments when customized on toolbars or menus.
