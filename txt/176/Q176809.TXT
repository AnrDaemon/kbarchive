TITLE   :XADM: EDBUTIL.EXE does not Return Non-zero Error Code
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5, when you run the EDBUTIL utility
against the Microsoft Exchange Directory or Information Store, you will receive
a message indicating that ESEUTIL should be run instead. However, EDBUTIL.EXE
does not return a non-zero return code in this case. This will present a problem
if you are using a batch file which calls EDBUTIL and performs error level
checking based on the return code.

WORKAROUND
==========

Replace all occurrences of EDBUTIL.EXE with ESEUTIL.EXE in the batch file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
