TITLE   :XADM: Batch Setup-Setup /r /q Options Combined Unsupported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to run Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Setup with the /r /q <ini
filename> options, the /r command is ignored. This is equivalent to running
Setup /q <ini filename>.

CAUSE
=====

Batch mode Setup, Setup /r /q <ini filename> is not a supported Setup
combination. There is no validation on options supplied during a command- line
Setup.

This is by design.

Additional query words: Forklift
