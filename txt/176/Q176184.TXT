TITLE   :XFOR: Message Format Differs Between POP and MAPI Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a MAPI client receives messages from the Internet, Internet Mail (also
known as IMAIL) converts the original Internet message to a MAPI message
properly; and the message would be delivered to the user's inbox. However, if
the user tried to read the message through a POP client, the message that the
user sees on a POP client may not look the same as it looks in a MAPI compliant
client. This problem is evident when POP Client views MIME messages with
multipart/alternative bodypart inside a multipart/related.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internet Mail attempts its best to preserve the original Internet message format
when converting a MAPI message (which had originally come in from Internet) to
Internet format. If this preservation is complete, the "full fidelity" was being
preserved. The described problem indicates that the full fidelity preservation
has failed for MIME messages with multipart/alternative bodypart inside a
multipart/related. This is causing the message viewed in a POP client to be
different than the original Internet message.
