TITLE   :WINS Manager Displays Dots Instead of Sixteenth Character
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view your Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) database in the Show
Database dialog box of WINS Manager, there may be a series of three dots instead
of the normal sixteenth character hexadecimal identifier.

For example:

   Server1...

whereas you would normally see:

   Server1[20h]

NOTE: This does not cause name resolution problems for clients using the same
NetBIOS Scope.

CAUSE
=====

You configured your WINS Server with a NetBIOS Scope in the TCP/IP Properties.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is strictly a display problem and does not provide any name
resolution problems. To view the complete WINS entries, you will need to do one
of the following:

 - Disable the NetBIOS Scope identifier on the WINS Server.

   -or-

 - Winsdmp.exe or Winscl.exe from the Windows NT Server Resource Kit to view
   your WINS information.

TITLE : Using WINSCL.EXE

MORE INFORMATION
================

Your WINS Server stores the NetBIOS name with the hex value as the sixteenth
character. The entry has the NetBIOS Scope appended to the sixteen characters.

NOTE: Using a NetBIOS Scope improperly can result in failure to establish trusts
between domains, and loss of connectivity.
