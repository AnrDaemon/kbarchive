   the system event log. Consult your network administrator to resolve the
   conflict.

 - The system has detected a conflict for IP address <n.n.n.n> with the
   system having hardware address 11:11:11:11:11:11. The interface has been
   disabled.

NOTE: One of these error messages may be displayed regardless of the IP address
that you attempt to use.

and the router's Proxy Mode setting is configured to Always.


RESOLUTION
