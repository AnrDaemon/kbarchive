SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5, the Search LDAP (Directory) Site
Default Help topic contains incorrect information about the differences between
Initial and Final substring searches.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The correct information for these two types of searches is described below:

 - Initial substring search

   The directory matches the substring that the user specifies against the
   beginning of an attribute in the directory. For example, an Initial substring
   search for |St| in a display name would return Stacey and Steve, but not Sean
   or Shannon. Initial substring searches are typically faster than the other
   types of substring searches.

 - Final substring search

   The directory matches the substring that the user specifies against the end of
   an attribute in the directory. For example, a Final substring search for |ne|
   in a display name would return Suzan Fine. Final substring searches are
   typically slower than Initial substring searches.
