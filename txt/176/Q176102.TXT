The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.5, 2.51, 2.52, 2.6, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send or receive e-mail on MSN, The Microsoft Network, using
Microsoft Outlook Express, you may receive one of the following error messages:

   The connection to the server has failed. Account: 'MSN Mail', Server:
   'smtp.email.msn.com', Protocol: SMTP, Port: 465, Secure(SSL): Yes, Socket
   Error: 10061, Error Number: 0x800CCC0E.

   The connection to the server has failed. Account: 'MSN Mail', Server:
   'pop3.email.msn.com', Protocol: pop3, Port: 995, Secure(SSL): Yes, Socket
   Error: 10061, Error Number: 0x800CCC0E.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may have one of two causes:

 - Outlook Express may be attempting to connect to the MSN e-mail server using a
   Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) secure connection. SSL security is not supported
   by the MSN e-mail server.

 - You have installed MSN Explorer, and your e-mail has been converted to
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) e-mail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do one of the following:

 - Call MSN Internet Access Technical Support at 1-877-635-7019, and ask a
   Customer Service Representative to run the "POP3 Rollback tool" on your
   account.

 - You can also set up Outlook Express 5 or greater to read your HTTP e-mail,
   without reverting your e-mail to Post Office Protocol (POP3) by going to:
   http://supportservices.msn.com/us/oeconfig

If none of the above apply to you, do the following using Outlook Express 5 or
greater

To remove and reinstall your account with Outlook Express 5 or greater

1. Start Outlook Express.

2. Click Tools, and then click Accounts.

3. Click the Mail tab.

4. Select the account--MSN Mail, pop3.email.msn.com, or similarly named
   listings, and then click Remove.

5. Click Close.

6. Quit Outlook Express.

7. Connect to the Internet.

8. Go to: http://supportservices.msn.com/us/oeconfig

9. Click Continue.

10. When prompted for sign-in, type your e-mail address (including the @msn.com
   suffix) and password.

11. Click Sign-In, and then click Continue.
   The wizard will now install the POP3 account in Outlook Express.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this issue continues to occur, or if Outlook Express is not using an SSL
secure connection, remove and reinstall the MSN Mail account in Outlook Express.
