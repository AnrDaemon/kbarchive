SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a conditional MERGEFIELD for a result that includes quotation
marks, the result of the field contains a backslash.

For example, if you have the following conditional statement in your mail merge
main document, which uses backslashes to have quotation marks appear in the
result of a true condition for a record

   {IF {MERGEFIELD name} = "Jo Brown" "\"Now is the time...\"" "false
   condition"}

you would expect to receive the result of "Now is the time" on a true statement.
However, Word gives you the following result:

   "Now is the time...\"

NOTE: This problem may also occur with commas or backslashes.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Use Two Apostrophes
-----------------------------

Instead of using \" (backslash double-quotation mark), use two apostrophes ('')
and remove the backslash.

Method 2: Use the Edit/Replace Command
--------------------------------------

To work around this problem, use a unique character in place of the quotation
mark. After the merge is completed, use the Replace command to search for the
unique character, and replace it with a quotation mark. (Note that the character
you choose must not occur elsewhere in your document.)

Example:

In the merge field, use the pound sign instead of quotation marks.

   {IF {MERGEFIELD name} = "Jo Brown" "#Now is the time...#" "false condition"}

After the merge is completed, follow these steps to replace the pound sign with a
quotation mark:

1. On the Edit menu, click Replace.

2. In the Find what box, type the unique character (the pound sign, in this
   example).

3. In the "Replace with" box, type a quotation mark.

All instances of the unique character (the pound sign, in this example) are
replaced with a quotation mark.
