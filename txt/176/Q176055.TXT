The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

MSN, The Microsoft Network, uses the Msn.ini file to automatically configure MSN
Program Viewer. When you connect to MSN, MSN Program Viewer compares the copy of
the Msn.ini file on the server to the copy on your computer. If your computer
has an older version of the Msn.ini file or if the Msn.ini file is not present,
MSN Program Viewer copies the server version of the Msn.ini file to your
computer.

If you use Windows 98 the Msn.ini file contains menu information for the Quick
View program on the System Tray and information for the default MSN home page.

A damaged Msn.ini file can cause problems when you use MSN Program Viewer. If you
suspect that your Msn.ini file is damaged, you can delete or rename all copies
of the Msn.ini file on your computer, and then connect to MSN to automatically
receive a new copy of the Msn.ini file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To rename the Msn.ini file and obtain a new copy from the server, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "msn.ini" (without the quotation marks).

   Repeat this step for each copy of the Msn or Msn.ini file in the search
   results list.

6. Connect to MSN to automatically receive a new copy of the Msn.ini file. If
   you use Windows 98, click the MSN Quick View icon in the System Tray, and
   then click Connect To MSN to receive a new copy of Msn.ini.
