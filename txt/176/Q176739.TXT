OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you are using the routing feature in following
scenario:

   UNIX (host1.osu.com)----Exchange Server (osu.com)-----Internet

In the registry for IMS/Parameters to have: AddressRewrite:DWORD=1 and
ResolveP2:DWORD=1.

In Exchange Server, you create a custom recipient for a USER1 on host1 as
follows:

   smtp user1@host1.osu.com SMTP user1@osu.com

A message is sent from user1 where the originator address is user1@host1.osu.com
into Exchange Server destined to the Internet.

The problem is that the Internet recipient sees user1@host1.osu.com in the 822
body instead of user1@osu.com.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
