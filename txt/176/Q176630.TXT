TITLE   :SMSINST: How to Use a Custom Progress Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Most of the dialog boxes associated with a Systems Management Server Installer
generated script can be customized directly by using the Installer user
interface (UI). The Progress Bar dialog box that is displayed while files are
being copied cannot be customized directly through the Installer UI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample code for a Custom Progress Bar DLL is included with the Systems
Management Server Installer. This source code is located by default in the
following folder:

   \Program Files\Microsoft SMS Installer\DLL\Progress

This source code is currently 16-bit only and must be compiled with a 16- bit
compiler. Microsoft Visual C version 1.52c can open Progress.mak and compile it
with no changes. To use this 16-bit DLL, you must specify the DLL in the Custom
Progress Bar DLL dialog box of Installation Properties, on the Screen tab. You
must also specify "Windows 3.1x, 95 and NT (Win16/Win32)" as your destination
platform in the Installation Properties, on the Global tab. If you specify
"Windows 95 and NT (True Win32)", you will receive the following error message
when you compile your script:

   The custom progress bar DLL must match the installation EXE type (Win16 or
   Win32).

The error occurs because the True Win32 (32-bit) installation executable file
cannot directly call a 16-bit DLL.
