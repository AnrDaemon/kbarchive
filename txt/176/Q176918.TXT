SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to change the network path for a printer (LPT) port by using the
NET USE command at a command prompt, the path changes for MS-DOS-based programs,
but not for Windows-based programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, change the network path in Control Panel instead of
using the NET USE command. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the printer whose network path you want to change, and then click
   Properties.

3. Click the Details tab, click End Capture, and then click the LPT port you
   want to release.

4. Click Capture Port, and then click the LPT port you want to capture in the
   Device box.

5. In the Path box, type the path to your network printer.

6. Click OK, click OK, and then close the Printers window.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
