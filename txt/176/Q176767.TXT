TITLE   :SNA Print Service Prints 80 Columns per Line Instead of 132
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Even though a host printer session is configured to use 132-column printing with
the SNA Print Service, the print job is still printed with 80 columns per line.

When the host sends an FMH-1 Read Partition query for an LU1 print session, the
SNA Print Service responds with a usable size of 24x80, even though the SNA
Server printer session is configured to use a maximum print position (MPP) of
132 columns. This causes the host to set MPP to 80 instead of 132.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Print Service is ignoring the configured Default Page Width setting in
the SNA Server configuration and always indicating a maximum page width of 80
columns.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the SNA Print Service included
in Microsoft SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 Service Pack 1, and 3.0 Service Pack
2.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
