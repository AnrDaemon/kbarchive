TITLE   :System Is Running Low on Registry Quota
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Registry Size Limit is set too low, the following popup error message
will be displayed on the screen:

   {Low on Registry Quota}
   Your system is running low on registry quota.
   Start the System option in the Control Panel and choose
   the Virtual Memory button to increase the registry quota.


CAUSE
=====

When applications such as Rdisk.exe and other Backup software are used to backup
the registry, the amount of paged pool memory used by these applications are
charged towards the registry's quota. If the amount consumed reaches 95 percent
of the Registry Size Limit then the warning popup mentioned above will be
displayed. The warning is displayed only once for each boot cycle; which means
that the popup will not be displayed until the system is rebooted, and the
threshold reached again.

WORKAROUND
==========

On Windows NT 4.0 systems, in Performance Monitor, "Percent Registry size used
counter" under the System object can be used to monitor this setting. The rule
of thumb to follow is to double the current registry size, and add 20 percent to
that value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

"Maximum Registry Size" also known as "Registry Size Limit" can be specified in
the Virtual Memory dialog box in the System/performance section of Control
Panel.

This value enables one to specify the maximum size of the registry, and also
limit the use of paged pool memory used by applications calling registry APIs.
