TITLE   :XADM: Deferred Delivery Settings Not Effective
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a message is sent using an Outlook client with specific deferred delivery
options set, the deferred delivery options are ignored and the mail item may
take an exceptional amount of time to be delivered.

If there is a time difference between the originating client and the originating
server, this is behavior is by design. It should be considered to be an issue if
there is not a time difference between the originating client, receiving client,
and two host servers.

CAUSE
=====

The deferred delivery time is not being implemented for local delivery.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
