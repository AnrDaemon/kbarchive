PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0;Windows:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the NET TIME command to display the time on a specific remote
computer, the time displayed may be incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because when you use the NET TIME \\<servername>
command to display the time on a remote computer, the result displayed is
obtained by applying local time settings to the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the
remote computer. This behavior can occur if, for example, the time zone and
daylight savings time settings on the remote and local computers are different.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT versions
3.51 and 4.0.
