TITLE   :Disabling CSNW in Hardware Profile Causes Lengthy Logon Delay
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you disable Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services for
NetWare (GSNW) in a hardware profile, it may result in an additional two-minute
delay in logging on to the computer and gaining access to the desktop.

Conversely, if the Startup type is set to "disabled" for the CSNW or GSNW service
in the Services tool in Control Panel (not as part of a hardware profile), the
logon process takes approximately 10 seconds.

MORE INFORMATION
================


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, press CTRL+ALT+DEL again at the Windows NT logo
bitmap screen to bypass the two-minute wait and immediately get to the desktop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
