TITLE   :XCON: NDRs Dropped on Message to Recipient w/ Multiple DDAs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you submit a message to a recipient address that contains multiple DDA
pairs, any non-delivery report (NDR) that may occur for the message will be
discarded by the Store. An example of an address which meets this criteria is as
follows:

   C=<country code>;A=<admd>;P=<prmd>;O=<organization>;
   DDA:RFC822=User@domain.com;DDA:MSXCX500=C=<country code>;A=<admd>;
   P=<prmd>;O=<organization>;OU=<organizational unit>;CN=User

CAUSE
=====

As in the above example, the DDA pairs are defined in the following order:

   DDA1 type, DDA1 value, DDA2 type, DDA2 value

However, when parsing the address, the order was assumed as DDA1 type, DDA2 type,
DDA1 value, DDA2 value. As such, a failure occurs upon parsing of the address
when more than 1 DDA is present.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
