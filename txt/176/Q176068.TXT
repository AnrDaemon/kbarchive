TITLE   :XADM: Err: "Private store could not be updated" Running Isinteg
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Isinteg utility in patch mode (isinteg
-patch), you may receive the following error message:

   Private store could not be updated. Reason Jet_errMissingLogFile

WORKAROUND
==========

Before you run the Isinteg utility, you must do the following:

1. Start MSExchangeIS.

2. Stop MSExchangeIS.

3. Run the utility in patch mode with this command:

   isinteg -patch

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error may occur when you attempt to run Isinteg -patch after the
information store is restored from an online backup. Running isinteg against
such an information store may cause the above errors.

The errors may also indicate that the user is missing some log files. Locate the
Priv.edb and Pub.edb files and compare the file dates to the Edb*.log file
dates. The dates of the logs should match those of the EDB files if they were
restored from the same backup, because the services should have been stopped for
the EDB files to be backed up.

If the dates do not match, ask the user to locate a consistent, even older,
backup. If another backup is not available, copy these *.edb files into the
Mdbdata directory, delete the *.chk and *.log files that were previously in the
Mdbdata directory before you attempt to run Isinteg in patch mode.

It is not necessary to run Isinteg in patch mode if the information store has
been restored from an online Windows NT Server backup. The Windows NT Server
Backup utility already includes this Isinteg patch process.
