TITLE   :XCLN: Send to Alias Name Cannot Be Resolved
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running applications that use Simple MAPI, such as Microsoft Office or
Microsoft Outlook, you may encounter a problem with resolving an alias name when
sending e-mail if that alias name has a leading space. Either you cannot resolve
the name, or the following error message, or similar error message, may appear:

   Unable to resolve "group"

where group is the name of the alias that has the leading space.

CAUSE
=====

Simple MAPI cannot resolve names that begin with a space. However, Exchange
Server uses Extended MAPI, which allows leading spaces. Therefore, Exchange
Administrators can create names with leading spaces, but Simple MAPI
applications cannot use them.

WORKAROUND
==========

In Microsoft Exchange Server, change the alias name of the distribution list, so
that the alias no longer contains a leading space.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Exchange Server, a distribution list has two names: the alias name and the
display name. Exchange Server uses the display name for sorting the distribution
lists in the address book, and with a leading space they sort to the beginning
of the list. Changing only the alias name so that it does not have a leading
space allows Exchange Server to resolve the name, because Exchange uses both the
display and alias names to resolve the entry.
