PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a remote control session, if the Windows NT client being remote
controlled is rebooted using a method other than the Reboot button under Help
Desk, the Systems Management Server Administrator Quick Viewer window does not
appear after the remote control session is re-established. The current status
under Help Desk will show Viewing ... Done. A second attempt returns the
message:

   Cannot establish a security context with this client

When the client is rebooted again, Windows NT gives the message:

   Help Desk options program is not responding Cancel Wait End

The default values for the Help Desk settings are set properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To successfully restart a client computer during a Remote Control session, only
reboot the client from within the Quick Viewer window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
