The preferred method for accessing Microsoft Excel for Windows Object properties
is to add the Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library as an available reference. To
add the Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library reference in Word, follow these
steps:

1. In the Visual Basic Editor, click References on the Tools menu.

2. Under Available References, select the "Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library"
   check box.

3. Click OK.

After creating the reference, create and run the following Visual Basic macro:

        Sub InsertXLChart()
         Dim xlapp As Excel.Workbook
         Documents.Add
         ' Replace "XLfilename" with a complete path and file name
         ' for an Excel worksheet that includes a chart.
         Set xlapp = GetObject("XLfilename")
         ' Activate the first chart in workbook.
         xlapp.ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(1).Activate
         ' Select the chart.
         xlapp.ActiveChart.ChartArea.Select
         ' Copy the chart.
         xlapp.ActiveChart.ChartArea.Copy
         With Selection
            ' The wdPasteOLEObject constant will insert the chart as an
            ' embedded object, and the wdInLine constant will insert the
            ' chart on the Text layer and not the Drawing layer.
            .PasteSpecial Link:=False, DataType:=wdPasteOLEObject, _
               Placement:=wdInLine
         End With
         ' Close the instance of Excel.
         Set xlapp = Nothing
      End Sub
