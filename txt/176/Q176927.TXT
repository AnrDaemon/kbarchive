TITLE   :FP98: Newest to Oldest Order Doesn't Work in Discussion Web
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 2000 version of this article, see Q197624.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to list a table of contents in newest to oldest order in the
Discussion Web Wizard after you have installed the FrontPage 98 Server
Extensions, the articles are posted in oldest to newest order instead.

For example, if you post three articles before you upgrade the FrontPage Server
Extensions, they will be listed in newest to oldest order in the Tocproto.htm
file. After you upgrade the FrontPage Server Extensions, the original articles
retain their order, but new articles are posted in oldest to newest order, as
shown in the following table.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this behavior you must install the updated version of the FrontPage
Server Extensions. Upgrading the extensions will not fix the existing posts, but
will correct the order on posts published after the upgrade. For more
information about obtaining and installing the FrontPage Server Extensions,
please see the following Microsoft Web site:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions, version
3.0.2.1330.
