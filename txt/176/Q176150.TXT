TITLE   :XADM: P42 Message Delivery Fails Setting ENTRYID
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to retrieve a P42 signed/encrypted message, the client may
experience problems opening the message. Support for the P42 protocol (Secure
Data Network Systems Message Security Protocol Support) gives Microsoft Exchange
Server DMS users the benefit of adding hardware-based (for example, Fortezza
cards) end-to-end security, including signed receipts, non- repudiation,
privacy, and content integrity to their communications.

CAUSE
=====

When opening signed/encrypted P42 messages, the DMS extension DLL creates non
Unicode one off entry identifiers in a flat entry list
(PR_REPLY_RECIPIENT_ENTRIES) for recipients that are to get a reply. The MAPI
methods SetProps and GetProps are used to retrieve or modify the
PR_REPLY_RECIPIENT_ENTRIES property for the entry identifier. During GetProps,
the address type, e-mail address, and display name in the one-off entry
identifier is converted to the client's codepage. Because entry identifiers are
binary, there is no associated codepage information, except to indicate if it is
Unicode. Microsoft Exchange Server assumes that if the entry identifier is not
Unicode, the destination must be Unicode.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

To resolve this issue, the address type, e-mail address, and display name are
converted to Unicode during SetProps for the property
PR_REPLY_RECIPIENT_ENTRIES. During GetProps for this property, no conversion
will be done if the one off entry identifier is in Unicode and the destination
code page is in Unicode, or if the entry identifier nor the destination code
page is in Unicode.
