TITLE   :XFOR: Information Store Stops Unexpectedly with Null Recipient
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message in Universal Transformation Format (UTF) through the
Internet Mail Service (IMS) to a recipient who does not have a display name, the
information store may stop unexpectedly when another person attempts to receive
the message using a post office protocol version 3 (POP3) e-mail client.

CAUSE
=====

When you send a message to a recipient who does not have a display name, the
display name is converted to a null value instead of a blank string value.
Microsoft Exchange Server does not properly process UTF messages with a null
recipient when they are received using POP3.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
