The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are attempting to log on through Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) to
a Microsoft Exchange mailbox that contains double quote marks in the alias name,
such as "James", you may receive one of the following error messages:

   Failed to connect to the Microsoft Exchange Server, <servername>

-or-

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site
   http://<servername>/exchange/LogonFrm.asp?isnewwindow=0&mailbox=%22<user
   name>%22.
   The operation completed successfully.

CAUSE
=====

It is possible to create a mailbox alias that contains double quotes using the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. The Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft
Outlook clients are capable of opening a mailbox with this type of alias.
However, Outlook Web Access and Active Server Components do not support this and
will fail with one of the errors stated above.
