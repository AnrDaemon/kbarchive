======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Age of Empires, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup program for Age of Empires, the computer may stop
responding (hang) when the installation is from 3 to 13 percent complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reducing the caching on the CD-ROM drive may resolve this issue.

To reduce CD-ROM data caching, you must determine whether you are using real-mode
or protected-mode drivers to access the CD-ROM drive. To determine this, follow
these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

If a CD-ROM device is listed, you are using protected-mode drivers. Follow the
steps in the "Reducing Protected-Mode CD-ROM Drive Caching" section later in
this article. If a CD-ROM device is not listed, follow the steps in the
"Reducing Real-Mode CD-ROM Drive Caching" section.

Reducing Real-Mode CD-ROM Drive Caching
---------------------------------------

To reduce CD-ROM data caching using real-mode drivers, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then click File System.

4. Click the CD-ROM tab.

5. In the Optimize Access Pattern For box, click No Read-Ahead.

6. Click OK, and then click Close.

7. If you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

Reducing Protected-Mode CD-ROM Drive Caching
--------------------------------------------

To reduce CD-ROM data caching using protected-mode drivers, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then click File System.

4. Click the CD-ROM tab.

5. In the Optimize Access Pattern For box, click No Read-Ahead.

   NOTE: Selecting a faster speed than is appropriate for your CD-ROM drive does
   not necessarily increase performance.

6. Make sure that the Supplemental Cache Size slider is set all the way to the
   left (the Small setting), and then click OK.

7. Click OK, and then click Close.

8. If you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.
