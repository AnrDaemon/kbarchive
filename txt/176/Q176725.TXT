TITLE   :XCLN: Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS Client Fails with Memory Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You can read messages in the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS Client, but when you
attempt to send, forward, or reply, the following error message might be
displayed:

   The message could not be sent.

   You need more memory to perform this operation.
   Close some windows and try again.

   Microsoft Exchange for MS-DOS

   ID No: 5803 - 5001

CAUSE
=====

This message can occur when the Microsoft Exchange Server fails to return
required addressing information. In a very large organization with many address
types, the address type information can exceed the RPC buffer space. The failure
is returned to the Exchange MS-DOS Client as a lack of memory and results in the
message shown above.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS
client, versions 4.0 and 5.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The corrected MS-DOS Client has a larger RPC buffer and is able to retrieve all
of the information needed to complete the send, forward, or reply.
