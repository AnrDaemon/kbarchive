The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
 - Microsoft Active Server Pages, version 1.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use Active Server Pages (ASP), an Internet Server Extension, to
dynamically generate HTML pages on the server side, and the ASP pages are client
independent.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You implement ASP pages by using the Asp.dll file to and process the text files
containing ASP code. When a request for a page with an extension associated with
ASP is received, the Asp.dll file is called by the Internet Information Server
(IIS).

NOTE: By default, the extension for Active Server Pages is .Asp.

It is possible to use ASP with different types of Internet servers. However, the
only servers tested and supported is Microsoft Internet Information Server
version 3.0.
