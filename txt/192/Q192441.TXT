RESOLUTION

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

   the CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper cloth which
   can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you clean the CD-ROM, wipe
   from the center of the disc outward; do not use a circular motion.

2. Remove Streets 98 and Trip Planner 98. To do so, follow these steps:
   a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

      Tools, and then click ScanDisk.

      computer, press and hold down the CTRL key and then click to select all of
      the hard disks.

   c. Click Thorough, and then click Start.

4. Reinstall the program or programs you removed. To do this, insert the
   installation CD-ROM for the program into the CD-ROM drive, and then follow
   the instructions on the screen to finish reinstalling the program.

   If the installation program does not start automatically, follow these steps:
   a. Click Start, and then click Run.

   b. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

   " <drive>:\setup.exe " (without the quotation marks)

      where <drive> is the letter of the CD-ROM drive that contains the
      installation CD-ROM for the program.
