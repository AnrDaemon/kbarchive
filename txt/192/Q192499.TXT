SUMMARY
=======

You can query on <NULL> values when you use WBEM Query Language (WQL). The
operators 'NULL' and 'NOT NULL' do work for queries. The problem occurs because
the base class code has no concept of <NULL> values and all <NULL>
values are returned as blank.

You can query on <NULL> and have the correct instance data returned, but
you will not see <NULL> values in the instance.

Additional query words: prodsms query null sms20
