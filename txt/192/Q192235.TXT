TITLE   :NetShow Installation on a Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install NetShow On-Demand server on a Windows Terminal
Server, the following error message may be displayed:

   An Application Using Data Access Object or the Jet Database Engine is
   currently running. Setup cannot complete until this application is shut down.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is because of the jet database engine for the MSTSC running on the
Windows Terminal Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you stop the service, the install completes. There are two ways to accomplish
this task:

 - Close any client connections made to itself. Ensure there is no dialog box
   displayed with a prompt for a connection server.

 - Open Task Manager and end the Mstsc.exe process.

NOTE: This will end the locally attached session or sessions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Terminal Server version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post additional information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
