KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbConfig smssetup smsconfig

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server version 1.2, Windows NT clients must report by
means of Windows NT logon servers. Windows NT-based clients depend on Windows NT
logon servers to receive the Windows NT and Systems Management Server client
component services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT logon servers have the SMS_CLIENT_CONFIG_MANAGER service installed.
This service is responsible for remotely installing and configuring the Windows
NT client-side services on Systems Management Server client computers running
Windows NT. The SMS_CLIENT_CONFIG_MANAGER service on each Windows NT logon
server writes a log of this activity to the SMS\Logs\Clicfg.log file on the
Windows NT logon server.

Because Novell NetWare is not service-based, this service cannot be installed on
logon servers running Novell NetWare. Therefore, NetWare logon servers cannot
properly configure Windows NT clients for Systems Management Server operation.

For more information on Windows NT client installation, see chapter 3 of the SMS
Resource Guide, Back Office Resource Kit Part I page, 98-100.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
