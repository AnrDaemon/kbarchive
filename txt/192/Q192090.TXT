TITLE   :BUG: UserControl Property Value Changes Lost When Building EXE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Standard EXE project that contains a UserControl. You change the
property values of the UserControl and build the EXE. The property value changes
you made do not take effect in the compiled application, and the property values
in the project have reverted back to previous or default values.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three resolutions to this problem:

1. Run the project before building the EXE. (Make sure the form containing the
   UserControl is displayed during this process.)

2. Close the form hosting the UserControl before building the EXE.

3. Save the project before building the EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. From the Project menu, add an User Control to the project.

3. Add the following code to UserControl1:

         Public Property Get BackColor() As OLE_COLOR
            BackColor = UserControl.BackColor
         End Property

         Public Property Let BackColor(ByVal New_BackColor As OLE_COLOR)
            UserControl.BackColor() = New_BackColor
            PropertyChanged "BackColor"
         End Property

         ' Load property values from storage

         Private Sub UserControl_ReadProperties(PropBag As PropertyBag)
         UserControl.BackColor = PropBag.ReadProperty("BackColor", &H8000000F)
         End Sub

         ' Write property values to storage
         Private Sub UserControl_WriteProperties(PropBag As PropertyBag)
            Call PropBag.WriteProperty("BackColor", _
               UserControl.BackColor, &H8000000F)
         End Sub

4. Place an instance of UserControl1 on Form1.

5. Click on the UserControl to select it, and change the value of the BackColor
   property.

6. Build the project (File...Make Project1.exe).

7. Note that the BackColor of the UserControl reverts back to its original color
   in the IDE.

8. Run the EXE created in step 5. Note that the change to the BackColor property
   was lost.
