TITLE   :SMS: Ping Test on Windows NT Clients May Require Credentials
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbRemote kbsms200 kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A credentials dialog box appears on a Remote Administrator's User Interface,
asking for credentials to initiate a ping to a client. Most Administrators do
not expect to enter credentials before performing a ping test to a client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs because of Windows NT Security features and is a Windows
NT-based requirement, not a Systems Management Server 2.0 requirement.

Ping is designed to not require permissions and to always be enabled. Because
Windows NT requires credentials for access, the Windows NT credentials step
still remains.
