SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to insert a field into a Microsoft Word document
footer that prints the word "Continued" on all pages except the last page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To print the word "Continued" in a footer on all pages except the last one
without using section break, follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click Header And Footer.

2. Switch to the Footer by clicking the "Switch Between Header and Footer"
   button on the Header and Footer toolbar.

3. In the footer, press CTRL+F9 to insert field braces. Inside the braces, type
   "if " (without the quotation marks), press CTRL+F9 for another set of field
   braces, and type "numpages" (without the quotation marks) inside the field
   braces.

4. Press the RIGHT ARROW key twice to position the insertion point outside the
   closing brace of the NUMPAGES field. Type ">" (without the quotation
   marks), press CTRL+F9, and type "page" (without the quotation marks) inside
   these field braces.

5. Press the RIGHT ARROW key twice to position the cursor outside the closing
   brace of the PAGE field. Type a space and "Continued" (with the quotation
   marks).

   The field should appear as follows:

   {if {numpages}>{page} "Continued"}

NOTE: This method can be used to print or display any item in the header or
footer of a document excluding the last page. You can also use this method to
place a different item on the last page, for example

   {if {numpages}>{page} "Continued Next page." "The End of Document."}

the second group of text will appear on the last page of the document.
