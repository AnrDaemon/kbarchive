OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you go to Add/Remove Programs and try the Reinstall or Remove All options,
Terminal Server Client Setup requires the original installation point. It will
not let you choose an alternative installation point. If the server where the
client was originally installed is not available, Setup will fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, click the INSTALL button in Add/Remove Programs.
This allows you to choose the place from where to install the client. If you
want to remove the client, go to the original location and Remove All, or
install from a different location. Then you will be able to remove all from the
new installation point.
