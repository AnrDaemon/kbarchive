======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a portable computer is ejected from and inserted into its docking station in
either a "warm-docking" or "hot-docking" operation, 16-bit PC Card devices in
the docking station may not be enumerated correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been reported to occur with the following portable computers
and docking stations:

 - Hewlett-Packard OmniBook 7100 and OmniBook Full Docking Station

 - IBM ThinkPad 560D and ThinkPad Port Replicator w/Advanced EtherJet feature

 - IBM ThinkPad 380Z and ThinkPad Port Replicator w/Advanced EtherJet feature

The docking stations with which this problem occurs share the characteristic of
having a separate internal PCI bus that is connected to the laptop computer's
internal PCI bus through a PCI-to-PCI bridge.


RESOLUTION
==========


It is possible to work around this problem by ejecting and reinserting the PC
Card after docking the computer, following these steps:

1. Double-click the PC Card (PCMCIA) Status icon on the taskbar to display the
   PC Card (PCMCIA) properties.

2. In the list of sockets, locate the socket that is neither labeled as
   "(Empty)" nor as containing a PC Card device. Click that socket in the list,
   and then click Stop.

3. Remove the PC Card from the docking station. You should hear the PC Card
   removal sound, if such sounds are enabled on your computer.

4. Wait a few seconds, and then reinsert the PC Card. You should hear the PC
   Card insertion sound, if such sounds are enabled on your computer. The
   inserted PC Card should appear on the list in PC Card (PCMCIA) properties,
   and the device should be functional.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
