TITLE   :PRB: DAO Doesn't Support ISAM Formats on Alpha
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDAOsearch kbDatabase kbDriver kbIISAM kbODBC kbVC500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A DAO SDK is provided for Alpha computers. The DAO SDK allows applications
running on an Alpha computer to access Jet Databases (.mdb files). However, the
DAO SDK does not provide the ability to read the other Jet ISAM file formats
such as FoxPro, Excel, Text files, and so forth.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design. On an Alpha computer, you cannot use DAO or the Microsoft
Access ODBC driver to access data files other than .mdb files. The RISC version
of the Visual C++ VCRead.htm file states: The RISC version of the DAO SDK does
not contain support for the following data formats: Paradox Excel Lotus Exchange
Xbase text and html The above components can be selected from the installation
menus, but they will not be installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DAO SDK for Alpha computers is available for download from the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
