TITLE   :Windows Terminal Server Clients Do Not List Server Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows Terminal Server clients may not list Terminal Server names under the DNS
domain group in the connect list when browsing using DNS. They are listed as IP
addresses instead of names.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is because the Windows Terminal Server names start with the DNS
group name defined on the client using the registry key BrowseDNSDomain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use server names that do not start with the DNS
group name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Terminal Server clients can build a connect list Of Terminal Servers
using DNS based on the group name configured on the client. The group name is
defined on the client using the registry key BrowseDnsDomain.


In certain cases, however, clients are unable to list the Terminal Server names
that it received from the DNS server and lists only the IP addresses. This can
happen if the server names start with the group name.


Additional query words: domain reverse lookup
