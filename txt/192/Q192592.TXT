TITLE   :XADM: Paged Pool Memory Leak Caused by Attachment Processing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

While using a MAPI application that processes attachments, paged pool memory
increases over time without decreasing. There may be visible problems with the
desktop user-interface failing to process normally (failing to repaint the
screen properly, and missing images).


CAUSE
=====

When MAPI tries to obtain an icon image to display for the file attachment,
memory is allocated for the icon, and is not freed. The memory allocation is
small, but some messaging applications which process many messages with
attachments may be subject to this problem.


RESOLUTION
==========

MAPI has been corrected to free the memory allocation.

Exchange Server 5.0
-------------------

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems

specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains this fix.
