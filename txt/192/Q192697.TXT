TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Connector Ignores Export Custom Recipients Flag
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If there are two cc:Mail Connectors in the same site that each connect to a
different cc:Mail postoffice (PO), the two cc:Mail POs are not linked, except
through Exchange Server as a backbone. The default Exchange Server recipient's
container is the import container on both cc:Mail Connectors. If the user
includes the default recipient container for export and disables Export Custom
Recipients, both cc:Mail Connectors will still export the custom recipients from
the different cc:Mail POs when directory synchronization (dirsync) occurs.

Example:

   Ccmail PO1-----ccmc----Exchange---ccmc------Ccmail PO2

After dirsync, cc:Mail PO1 will have all the cc:Mail PO2 users' e-mail addresses
in the address book, and cc:Mail PO2 will have all the cc:Mail PO1 users' e-mail
addresses in the address book too.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
