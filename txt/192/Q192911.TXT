TITLE   :XFOR: Dirsync Between Notes and OV/VM over Exchange Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use LinkAge Directory Exchange version 3.2 to perform directory
synchronization between OV/VM and Lotus Notes over an Exchange Server 5.5
backbone, directory synchronization does not work.

In the following example, OV/MVS entries are not dirsynced to Lotus Notes and
vice versa:

   OV/MVS-----SNADS LDE------->Exchange 5.5----Exchange 5.5 Notes
   Connector ------>Notes


This problem only occurs if you use LinkAge Directory Exchange (LDE) and an
Exchange 5.5 connector to perform directory synchronization together.

CAUSE
=====

When custom recipients are dirsynced via LDE connectors to Exchange, the
recipients are not exported by any 5.5 connector, because their raw property
"imported from" field is listed as a type that the connector misunderstands it
received it from.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Component: Exchange Notes Connector

   File Name      Version
   -------------------------
   Lsdxamex.exe   5.5.2163.0


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
