TITLE   :SMS: Login Scripts Do Not Run from Subfolder in Netlogon Share
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a subfolder in the Export share (also known as the REPL$ share,
this share is the WINNT\System32\Repl\Export\Scripts directory), and place your
existing login scripts within this subfolder, Systems Management Server will
modify the login scripts. However, the login scripts may fail when run. You may
also see the following error message:

   The name specified is not recognized as an internal or external command,
   operable program or batch file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the login scripts from the subdirectory and
place them into the REPL$ share of the PDC. The REPL$ share can be found as the
following directory:

   WINNT\System32\Repl\Export\Scripts

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using the "Automatically Configure Workstation Logon Scripts" option for a
Systems Management Server site, depending on the client's domain, Systems
Management Server takes the following actions:

 - Systems Management Server automatically modifies all client logon scripts so
   that the SMSLS batch file is included. The SMSLS batch file will therefore
   run each time a user logs on to the site's domain.

 - Logon script files should be located under the Scripts directory in the Repl$
   share on the primary domain controller (PDC). The Repl$ share is the
   Winnt\System32\Repl\Export directory.

 - Systems Management Server only modifies user logon scripts with file
   extensions of .bat or .cmd. For example, a logon script called User.bat will
   be modified, but a logon script called User will not be modified. If there is
   no logon script specified in the account properties, Systems Management
   Server specifies Smsls.bat to be the user's login script.
