TITLE   :STOP 0x1E in Poolext.sys on Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to establish a Terminal Server session, a domain receives a blue
screen STOP Error, 0x0000001E (0xC0000005 0x800145DF 0x00000000 0x0000013C) in
Poolext.sys.

CAUSE
=====

Poolext was not designed for use on Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition. The
STOP 0x1E error is caused by an incompatibility in the design of the Poolext
driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can resolve the STOP 0x1E error by booting to the last known good
configuration and disabling the Poolext driver. If it is not possible to boot
using the last known good configuration, physically disconnect the server from
the network to prevent the blue screen STOP error from occurring.

To disable the driver, use the following procedure:

1. Log on to the console as the local administrator.

2. Run the Poolext Setup program.

3. Select the "Remove from this computer or another computer" radio (option)
   button, and click NEXT.

4. Select the "Remove from local computer" option and click NEXT.

5. Click the FINISH button to confirm removal.

6. The removal will require you to restart your computer. Click Yes to confirm
   restart, or click No to restart at a later time.

7. Reconnect the network cable (if it is disconnected), and start the computer.

STATUS
======

Poolext and the Microsoft Windows NT OEM Support Tools suite is provided for
troubleshooting and development for OEMs working with Microsoft Windows NT
Server and Workstation, versions 3.51 and 4.0, including all Service Pack
revisions. Currently, issues with Poolext are not supported on Windows NT
Terminal Server Edition.
