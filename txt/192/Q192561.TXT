======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a project with ATL 3.0 you may get a compiler error c2787 (no GUID
has been associated with this object).

CAUSE
=====

The newer versions of MIDL use the compiler facility [__declspec(uuid())] to tag
a GUID to an interface in the header files it generates. ATL version 3.0 makes
use of this fact in the implementation of COM_INTERFACE_ENRY macro; it now uses
the keyword __uuidof() to extract the interface ID from the MIDL-generated
header. ATL 2.1 uses the token pasting operator (IID_##IFoo) to get the
interface ID. This action requires including the MIDL-generated header and also
the "project_i.c", which MIDL generated.

If you use an older MIDL-generated header file [which does not use
__declspec(uuid())] with ATL 3.0, you will get this compiler error, because
__uudiof() can't extract the interface ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

Define the preprocessor symbol _ATL_NO_UUIDOF in the C/C++ tab of the Project
Settings dialog box. This forces ATL to use the token pasting operator (##)
rather than __uuidof() when forming the interface ID.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code
-----------

      COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY in ATL 2.1
      
         #define COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY(x)\ 
            {&IID_##x), \ 
            offsetofclass(x, _ComMapClass), \ 
            _ATL_SIMPLEMAPENTRY},
      
      COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY in ATL 3.0
      
         #ifndef _ATL_NO_UUIDOF
         #define _ATL_IIDOF(x) __uuidof(x)
         #else
         #define _ATL_IIDOF(x) IID_##x
         #endif
      
         #define COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY(x)\ 
            {&_ATL_IIDOF(x), \ 
            offsetofclass(x, _ComMapClass), \ 
            _ATL_SIMPLEMAPENTRY},

Newer MIDL headers files use the macros DECLSPEC_UUID() or MIDL_INTERFACE(),
which expand to __declspec(uuid()). MIDL versions 3.01.75 and later use the
__declspec directive.
