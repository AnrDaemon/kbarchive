SYMPTOMS
========

Using an ambiguous date/datetime string in Visual FoxPro 6.0 causes an ambiguous
date/datetime constant error message to occur. For example:

   Use the following format:

CAUSE
=====

The error message is missing a reference to an optional comma between the Date
and Time string.

RESOLUTION
==========

To include the Hour and retain Minutes and Seconds the default in your datetime
string, use one of the following formats:

      ?{^1998-12-12, 10} && This returns 12-12-98 10:00:00 AM

-or-

      ?{^1998-12-12 10:} && This returns 12-12-98 10:00:00 AM
