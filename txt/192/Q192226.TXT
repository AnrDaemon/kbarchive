TITLE   :FIX: Edit/Clear From Menu Fails to Clear General Field in Editor
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You attempt to clear a general field while in the editor, by using the Clear
option under the Visual FoxPro Edit menu. The general field appears to be
cleared, but if you edit the general field again, you will see the original
contents are again visible.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, you can use the BLANK command, specifying the general field as
the field to blank. For example:

   BLANK FIELDS <general field name>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The general field editor is opened by using MODIFY GENERAL <general field
name> or, within a grid or browse window, by double-clicking the general
field or pressing CTRL+PAGE DOWN while the general field has focus.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

         CREATE TABLE genfld (f1 c(5), f2 g)
         APPEND BLANK
         APPEND GENERAL f2 FROM (HOME()+'fox.bmp')
         WAIT WINDOW "Select Edit/Clear from menu, and close edit window" ;
          NOWAIT
         MODIFY GENERAL f2
         WAIT WINDOW "In VFP 5.0x this still has the image" NOWAIT
         MODIFY GENERAL f2

2. Select Edit/Clear from the menu.

3. Close the editor window.

The bitmap image reappears in the second editor window. To demonstrate the
workaround, run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

      CREATE TABLE genfld (f1 c(5), f2 g)
      APPEND BLANK
      APPEND GENERAL f2 FROM (HOME()+'fox.bmp')
      WAIT WINDOW "Close edit window to see workaround" NOWAIT
      MODIFY GENERAL f2
      WAIT WINDOW "The image will now be gone" NOWAIT

      * The following code clears the general field.
      BLANK FIELDS f2

      MODIFY GENERAL f2
