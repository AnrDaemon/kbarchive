SUMMARY
=======

When using StickyKeys, you expect to be able to press ALT, then press another
key and have it act as if you pressed the ALT-key. When using a Terminal Server
Client, this works fine for keys that are processed by the server. However,
Hotkeys that are processed by the client (such as ALT-HOME, ALT-PGUP) do not
work in this way.

For example, you might expect to be able to press ALT, then Home, and have the
Start Menu appear. However, with StickyKeys on, you may use the normal
shortcuts, such as CTRL-ESC. In other words, if connected to a Server and it has
StickyKeys enabled, press CTRL, then ESC to bring up the Start Menu.
