The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you display a Visual FoxPro ActiveDoc form in a restored Internet Explorer
window after it was started when the Internet Explorer window was maximized, you
will notice that the left side and top of the form is cut off.

RESOLUTION

Steps to Resolve

1. Press ALT + MINUS SIGN to expose the control menu of the form.

2. Choose Move.

3. Using the arrow keys on the keyboard, move the form window down until the
   form displays properly.

Another way to avoid this is to set the AutoCenter property of the form to False.
