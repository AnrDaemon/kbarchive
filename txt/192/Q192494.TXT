KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you configure your Systems Management Server site settings to prevent clients
from taking inventory over a slow link, inventory may still be taken if your
modem has compression enabled.

CAUSE
=====

When you take inventory, Netspeed.com attempts to determine the link speed by
reading the file Netspeed.dat across the client connection. A total of 3,400
bytes are read from Netspeed.dat on the logon server. The speed is measured in
the number of milliseconds to read the total bytes. The default of 3,400 bytes
within 850 milliseconds indicates a fast link. If it takes 850 milliseconds or
longer, it is considered a slow link.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

You may adjust the default 850 millisecond threshold by modifying a registry
key.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Slow Net Threshold Speed value under the following key in the
   registry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Systems Management Server
      \Components\SMS_Maintenance_Manager\Slow Net Threshold Speed

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type a value appropriate for your
   configuration, and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

For additional information about this registry value, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Netspeed.com reads Netspeed.dat over a RAS connection using modem
compression, the contents of the Netspeed.dat file may be compressed to a
smaller size, allowing Netspeed.com to misinterpret the speed of the RAS link.

Knowledge Base:
