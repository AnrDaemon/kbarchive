The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE version 2.0 for the Handheld PC 
 - Microsoft Windows CE version 2.0 for the Palm-size PC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The cursor functions SetCursorPos, GetCursorPos, ShowCursor, and ClipCursor are
not included in Winuser.h for the Handheld PC and Palm-size PC Platform SDK
because mouse cursors are not supported on these platforms. The online
documentation is not complete in this regard. These functions are available only
on platforms where mouse cursors are supported; for example, the Embedded
Toolkit PC-Based Hardware Development Platform. You will get a compile error if
you use these functions in an application that targets a Windows CE platform
that doesn't have mouse cursor support.

Do not use the SetCursorPos, GetCursorPos, ShowCursor and ClipCursor functions
with Windows CE platforms that don't have mouse cursor support.

This behavior is by design.
