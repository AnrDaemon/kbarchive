TITLE   :FIX: Beautify May Not Uppercase Extended ASCII Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Visual FoxPro's Beautify against code that contains extended ASCII
characters, the extended characters may not be set to the proper case.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The normal ASCII character set runs from ASCII 33 to ASCII 126, inclusive.
Extended ASCII characters are those outside of that range.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Because Microsoft Knowledge Base articles do not support extended ASCII
   characters, we will place the text in the Windows clipboard through the
   _CLIPTEXT environment variable, and paste it into a program file from the
   clipboard. Run the following code after pasting it into the Command window,
   placing the cursor at the end of the last line, and pressing ENTER:

         CLIPTEXT = ;
         "#DEFINE V"+chr(196)+"NSTER 1"+chr(13)+ ;
         "#DEFINE H"+chr(214)+"GER 2"+chr(13)+ ;
         "#DEFINE "+chr(197)+"TER 3"+chr(13)+ ;
         "? v"+chr(228)+"nster"+chr(13)+ ;
         "? h"+chr(246)+"ger"+chr(13)+ ;
         "? "+chr(229)+"ter"+chr(13)+ ;
         "? V"+chr(196)+"NSTER"+chr(13)+ ;
         "? H"+chr(214)+"GER"+chr(13)+ ;
         "? "+chr(197)+"TER"

2. Paste the contents of the clipboard into a program (.prg) file.

3. Right-click in the Editor window, and select Beautify from the Context menu.

4. In the Beautify Options dialog box, select the "Match first occurrence" in
   the Symbols drop-down list box, and then click the Run button.

   Look at the Editor for the results. The text following one or more of the
   first 3 ? commands contains a lower case character or characters.

5. From the Edit menu, click Undo.

6. Right-click the Editor Window, and then select Beautify from the Context
   menu.

7. In the Beautify Options dialog box, select the "UPPERCASE" in the Symbols
   drop-down list box, and then click the Run button.

Look at the Editor for the results. The text following one or more of the first 2
? commands contains a lower case character.
