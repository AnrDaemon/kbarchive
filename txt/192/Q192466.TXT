TITLE   :"System Error 53 Has Occurred" Using WLBS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using WLBS' NBT support to scale the performance of Windows NT read-only
file access and printing, attempts to use the Microsoft network commands, such
as net view and net use, fail with the following error:

   System error 53 has occurred. The network path was not found.

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by one of the following:

 - The cluster's system name was not resolved to an IP address.

-or-

 - The cluster IP address is not the NIC's first IP address listed in the TCP/IP
   configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do one of the following according to which of the above
causes is relevant:

 - Be sure to create the appropriate static WINS, DNS, or LMHOSTS file entry.

-or-

 - Use multiple NICs and be sure that the cluster's primary IP address is listed
   first in the TCP/IP configuration for the cluster NIC.

   NOTE: If the client is a Windows 2000-based computer, the preceding steps will
   not work. The workaround is to connect to the cluster by using the Virtual IP
   Address (VIP) such as "net use * \\<ipaddress>\ShareName".

   with an Alias Name

MORE INFORMATION
================

The cluster's system name, which is the first portion of the full Internet name,
must be a known NetBIOS computer name for NetBIOS to resolve it into an IP
address.

Because NetBIOS uses only the first IP address, the cluster IP address must be
listed first. Note that WLBS' NBT support cannot be used in single NIC
configurations because the dedicated IP address is always listed first when a
single NIC is used.
