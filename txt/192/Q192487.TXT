TITLE   :SMS: Logon Discovery May Not Find Windows NT Domain Controllers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In a Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 environment, all Windows NT
Server computers may not become Systems Management Server Logon Points.

The Systems Management Server 2.0 Logon Server Manager relies on the Windows NT
Master Browser to find Domain Controllers for Logon Discovery. This is an
intermittent problem that is dependant upon how up to date the Master Browser
list is when Logon Discovery takes place.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there is an open connection to the computer that needs to be a Logon Point,
then the computer will be in the Master Browser list. It will then be installed
the next time Logon Server Manager polls the domain.

This may account for Logon Points not being discovered and installed in some
instances.
