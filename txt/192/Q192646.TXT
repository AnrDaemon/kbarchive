TITLE   :PRB: Move 0 Does Not Refresh TimeStamp and Identity Fields
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With Visual Basic and SQL Server 6.5, Move 0 does not refresh the Timestamp and
Identity fields after Update/Addnew, when using the ClientBatch cursor driver.

CAUSE
=====

A client-side cursor is being used.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set cursordriver property to rdUseServer.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a test table with Timestamp field in SQL Server Pubs database. Run the
   following code in ISQL/W:

         CREATE TABLE BankTbl
                (Account int identity, Balance money, Stamp TimeStamp)
         INSERT INTO BankTbl (Balance) Values(1000)
         INSERT INTO BankTbl (Balance) Values(400)
         INSERT INTO BankTbl (Balance) Values(250)
         CREATE UNIQUE INDEX AcctIndex ON BankTbl(Account)

2. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

3. Add a Reference to Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0.

4. Place a CommandButton on the form.

5. Add the following code to the General Declarations of the form:

         Function TSToHex(sBinRep As rdoColumn) As String
            Dim sBuffer As String
            Dim b As Integer

            sBuffer = "0x"
            For b = 1 To 8        'Break up the binary
            sBuffer = sBuffer + Right$("00" & _
                      Hex(AscB(MidB(sBinRep, b, 1))), 2)
            Next b
            TSToHex = sBuffer     'Return the string
         End Function

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim cn As New rdoConnection
            Dim rs As rdoResultset
            Dim Timestamp As Variant
            Dim strConnect As String
            Dim strSQL As String
            strConnect = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=servername;Database= _
            pubs;Uid=sa;Pwd="

            With cn
               .CursorDriver = rdUseClientBatch
               .Connect = strConnect
               .EstablishConnection
            End With

            strSQL = "Select Account, Balance, Stamp from BankTbl"
            Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(strSQL, rdOpenstatic, rdConcurBatch)

            Debug.Print TSToHex(rs("Stamp"))
            rs.Edit
            rs!Balance = 99
            rs.BatchUpdate
            rs.Move 0
            Debug.Print TSToHex(rs("Stamp"))
         End Sub

6. Press the F5 key to execute code and note the same value appears twice in the
   Immediate Window.
