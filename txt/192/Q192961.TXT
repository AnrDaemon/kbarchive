TITLE   :PRB: SET DECIMAL Limited to Four Decimals in Currency Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The maximum number of decimal places allowed in a currency value is four. Using
the SET DECIMAL command to set more than four decimal places in a currency value
does not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the Transform function to convert a currency value to the number of
decimals you want, but this also changes the data type to character instead of
currency type. You will note this problem, for instance, if you type the
following in the Command window:

      x=$123.323
      ? TRANSFORM(x,'9999.9999999')

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the initial currency value has two decimals, setting SET DECIMAL to four pads
two zeros at the end of the currency value.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following commands in Command window or from a program:

         CLEAR ALL
         x=$37.493
         ?x       && displays 37.4938
         SET FIXED ON
         SET DECIMALS TO 2
         ?x       && displays 37.49
         SET DECIMAL TO  4
         ?x       && displays 37.4930
         SET DECIMALS to 7
         ?x       && displays 37.4930
         SET FIXED OFF

If the preceding code runs in Visual FoxPro 3.x, four decimals appear regardless
of the setting of the SET DECIMAL command.
