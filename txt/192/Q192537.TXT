TITLE   :PRB: Threads Consume Virtual Memory Quicker on Windows CE 2.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOAK kbVC500 kbOSWinCE210

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE 2.10 Enhancement Pack for Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications or libraries that create multiple threads and worked under Windows
CE 2.0 may encounter out-of-memory conditions when run under Windows CE version
2.1.

CAUSE
=====

Windows CE 2.1 now uses the stack reserve field in the program executable
header. The Visual C++ linker default reserve is 1 MB.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the /STACK switch in the linker settings, or the module definition file
STACKSIZE directive, to specify a lower default stack reserve.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Previous versions of Windows CE did not use the stack reserve field in the
program executable header. Even though the linker default reserve was 1 MB, the
operating system ignored this field, and used a predefined lower value. In
Windows CE 2.1, this field is now used and may result in virtual memory being
consumed quicker than anticipated. To circumvent this behavior, just add the
/STACK switch to the linker settings with a more reasonable reserve value, such
as

      /STACK:65536

or use the STACKSIZE directive in a module definition file:

      STACKSIZE 65536

The stack commit parameter for these switches is not currently used by the
Windows CE operating system.
