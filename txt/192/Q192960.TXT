TITLE   :PRB: Cannot Release Procedure's FXP if Class Definition in PRG
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a program file, when using the SET PROCEDURE TO command to call a procedure
file that has a Class Definition in it, issuing a RELEASE PROCEDURE command in
the program file will not release the procedure's FXP file even after the
program has been run. If the procedure file does not have any Class Definition
in it, RELEASE PROCEDURE will work as expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the CLEAR ALL command to release the procedure's FXP file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program file named mytest containing following code:

         FUNCTION TestFunction

         o=CREATEOBJECT("cTemp")
         o.SomeMethod()

         RETURN

         DEFINE CLASS cTemp AS Custom

            FUNCTION SomeMethod(lcText)
               lcText=IIF(type("lcText")="C",lcText,"HelloWorld")
               WAIT WINDOW lcText
            RETURN

         ENDDEFINE

2. In the Command window, run the following commands:

         CLEAR ALL
         CLOSE ALL
         CLEAR PROG

         SET PROCEDURE TO mytest
         ?SET("PROCEDURE")     && The name of the procedure file returned
         DO TestFunction

         RELEASE PROCEDURE mytest
         ?SET("PROCEDURE")     && Nothing returned

3. Go to Explorer and find mytest.fxp and try to delete the file. Note that the
   FXP file cannot be deleted, yet you cannot access either the function in the
   PRG or the class.
