TITLE   :Applications May Fail with Access Violation During File Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a non-administrator opens a file from within an application such as
Microsoft Paint, an access violation (AV) could occur causing the application to
terminate.

Restarting the system is required to clear the problem. The AV occurs in the MFC
DLLs. The problem does not occur if the user is an administrator.


CAUSE
=====

If Shell32.dll is invoked before Rpcss.exe, shell calls CreateEvent() to create
a certain event. An incorrect parameter passed on this call adds restrictions
(security) on the event object.

The problem does not occur if Rpcss.exe initializes first because the right
parameters are passed on the call to create the same event.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
