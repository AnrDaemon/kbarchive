TITLE   :Event ID 11 Changed to an Informational Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following message appears as an warning:

   Event ID   :  11
   Source     :  Serial
   Description:  The hardware resources for COM1 are already in use by
                 another device.

However, the device on COM1 continues to function normally.

CAUSE
=====

When modems are enumerated by Pnpisa.sys, entries are created in the registry.
When installing a third-party driver that is the equivalent of Serial.sys, these
entries confuse Serial.sys. During startup, Serial.sys attempts to manage this
device and claim those resources already used by the third-party driver. This
process fails and reports this as an error when, in fact, it is informational as
the device on COM1 is still functioning.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
