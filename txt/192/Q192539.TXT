SYMPTOMS
========

When a "using namespace std" directive is placed before a friend operator
declaration, you may get one of the following two errors:

Case 1
------

   error C2248: [member variable name] : cannot access private member declared
   in class [class name] [file name] (line number) : see declaration of [member
   variable]

Case 2
------

   [file name](line number) : fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR

   (compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 1786)
   Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++ Help menu, or
   open the Technical Support help file for more information.

   Error executing cl.exe.

CAUSE
=====

The friend operator resolution fails in the compiler front-end when std
namespace is introduced.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack 3 for Visual Studio 6.0 that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

Workaround
----------

Do one of the following to work around this problem:

 - Move the "using namespace std" directive after the friend operator
   declaration.
 - Avoid using the "using namespace std" directive.
 - Forward declare the operator and/or class.

        friend ostream& operator <<(ostream &, const CMyClass &);
        // An alternative workaround is to define the operator in the
        // class declaration. In this case it is not necessary to forward
        // declare the class and friend function.
