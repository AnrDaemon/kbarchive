TITLE   :XADM: Full Offline Address Book Download with Differences Specif
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Outlook clients can specify downloading of incremental changes to their offline
Address Book. In many cases the clients receive full downloads when smaller
updates should occur. These full downloads occur on the average, every second
download attempt.

CAUSE
=====

The offline Address Book file integrity is verified using calculated signatures.
Full downloads occur when these signatures do not match. A logic error on the
server causes Address Book changes to be processed in a different order than is
used by the client. This results in a signature mismatch and a subsequent
download of the entire Address Book.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
