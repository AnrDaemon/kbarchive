TITLE   :Winframe 1.x not detected by Terminal Server 4.0 for Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade Citrix Winframe 1.7 to Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition, Winframe 1.7 may not be detected on the computer. A
fresh install will be the only option presented.

CAUSE
=====

Registry inconsistencies may cause Terminal Server to ignore the Winframe
installation from being upgraded.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a utility (Regfix.exe) in the Support\Regfix folder that can repair
some instances of registry (hive) inconsistencies.

This utility will repair a Windows NT 3.51 or a Citrix WinFrame 1.x registry file
so that you can upgrade that installation to Windows Terminal Server.

usage: regfix inputfilename outputfilename

   inputfilename - the name of the registry file to process
   ouputfilename - the name for the updated registry file

Detailed Informaton:

To run Regfix.exe, you will have to run it from another Windows NT installation
so that you can safely modify the registry file. Here is the procedure to
follow:

1. If you do not have one already, you will have to install Windows NT to
   another partition.

2. Boot the system to an alternate Windows NT partition.

3. Change to the WinFrame\system32\config directory of the WinFrame (or Windows
   NT 3.51) partition to be updated:

      cd \winframe\system32\config

4. Rename the software hive to software.sav:

      ren software software.sav

5. Fix the registry file (assuming that d: is your CD-ROM drive):

      d:\support\regfix\regfix software.sav software

6. Restart the Windows Terminal Server upgrade.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition. We are researching this problem and will post additional
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
