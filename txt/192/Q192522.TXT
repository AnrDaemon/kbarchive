SUMMARY
=======

When a client is logged on to a Terminal Server, the local drives of the
computer from which he or she is connecting are not available. This article
describes how to make a client's local drives available, while logged on as a
client, to Microsoft Windows NT Terminal Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the following steps to make the client's local drives available to
them while he or she is logged on to Windows Terminal Server:

1. On the client's computer, go to the root of the drive you want to make
   available. Create a new share. Assign permissions only to the user whom you
   want to have access to the data.

2. Log the user on to the Windows Terminal Server, and then use the "Map Network
   Drive" option from Windows NT Explorer to connect the shared local drive.

Now the local drive will be available to the user while that user is logged on to
the Terminal Server Client.
