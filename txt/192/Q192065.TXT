TITLE   :XADM: High CPU Usage by STORE Displaying a Folder View
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server information store (Store.exe) process may appear
to hang and/or consume a high percentage of the systems processor utilization.
Using Windows NT performance monitor to view the "% Processor Time" of all the
threads being used by the Store.exe process will reveal one thread using the
majority of the processor time.


CAUSE
=====

A categorized view is defined as a view set on a folder in which its contents
are sorted or grouped by in some manner (for example, sorted by the From:
field). This sorting or grouping can be in ascending or descending order. When a
client sets this type of view on a folder, the information store creates a new
table in the Exchange database that contains the data needed to display this
view.

In this case, when the information store built the Exchange database table, the
contents were being sorted in a descending order. The Exchange database engine
needs to detect a terminator to know it is has processed all the data, and in
this case, the Exchange database engine was searching for the wrong terminator.
Because this terminator did not exist, the same portion of the code was being
executed repeatedly causing the information store process to utilize high
percentages of the system processor and causing the appearance of a hung client
for the user who was trying to enter this folder.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
