======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, MFC ActiveX control containers will enter a state
of infinite recursion that eventually leads to a stack overflow. The symptoms of
this are when the position of a control site changes, the program will seemingly
hang and eventually produce a stack overflow (0xC00000FD) operating system
exception. The stack trace looks like this:

   COleControlSite::MoveWindow
   COleControl::XOleInPlaceObject::SetObjectRects
   COleControl::OnSetObjectRects
   COleControlSite::MoveWindow
   ...

CAUSE
=====

When the position of the control site changes, the container code changes the
position of the reflector window (if present) and the tracker rectangles (if
present). The control container code eventually calls
COleControl::XOleInPlaceObject::SetObjectRects. (See CTLINPLC.CPP in the MFC
source.) SetObjectRects() makes a call to GetOuterWindow(), which returns the
reflector window if present. If the reflector window variable is NULL then the
same window object is returned, MoveWindow is then called using the returned
window object. This causes MoveWindow to be called on itself, resulting in a
recursive loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

One workaround is to copy the Visual C++ 5.0 version of the MFC42.DLL (File
version: 4.21.7303) to the home directory of the program experiencing this
problem. This will cause the program to use the older version of MFC, instead of
the MFC42.DLL that is located in the Windows system directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in the Visual Studio 6.0
Service Pack 1.
