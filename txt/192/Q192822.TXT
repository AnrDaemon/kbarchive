SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the START command with one of the priority class arguments (other
than NORMAL) to start a 16-bit Windows application on Windows NT, you notice
that the priority is still NORMAL.

CAUSE
=====

The exact cause has not yet been established. In general terms, the priority
class arguments appear to be "ignored" by the operating system for 16-bit
Windows applications.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
