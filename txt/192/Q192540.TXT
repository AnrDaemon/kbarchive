======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Service (Internet Mail Connector in version 4.0) may stop
delivering mail, and two Event IDs, 4018 and 4116, may be logged in the
Application Event Log. This article gives you a set of instructions to follow or
that can be e-mailed to customers for their use.


This behavior is usually the cause of bad messages that you need to remove, in
the Internet Mail Service folders that reside in the information store.

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service, you may receive the
following error messages:

   Event ID: 4018
   Type: Error
   Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Description: Unable to start the Internet Mail Connector service because MAPI
   could not be initialized.

   Event ID: 4116
   Type: Error
   Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Description: An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet
   Mail Service uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. It is
   possible that the piece of mail being processed at the time will not be
   delivered. The message that was being processed has been moved to the "BAD"
   folder.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because occasionally bad messages need to be removed
from the Internet Mail Service folders that are located in the information
store.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The messages that you saved from the In and Out folders can be replayed, but one
of them may be a bad message. To replay them, stop the Internet Mail Service,
move them a few at a time to the Imcdata\In (or Out) folder, delete the
Queue.dat file, and then start the service. The messages are processed normally
unless one of the messages is bad. If one of the messages is bad, it stops the
service, and you must repeat this process.
