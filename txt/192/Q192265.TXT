TITLE   :Winlogon Leaks Because of SMTPSVC Performance Counters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Over time, the Windows NT system responsiveness appears sluggish, and clients
may report a gradual decrease in system performance. Users connecting to the
server over the network may receive RPC Server Busy errors.

Side effects of the memory leak may include "Out of Virtual Memory" messages or
the system stops responding completely when memory is totally exhausted.

By tracking the handle count and the amount of Private Bytes for Winlogon.exe, it
can be observed that, over time, the values continue to increase.

CAUSE
=====

When running the resource kit utility Srvinfo.exe against a server remotely
handles to the registry are not closed if the server has the SMTP service
installed.

The following key was being repeatedly opened and not closed:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\SMTPSVC\Performance


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
