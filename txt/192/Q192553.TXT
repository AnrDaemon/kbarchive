The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the keyboard to move the insertion point from
one column to the next or to the previous column in a multiple-column Microsoft
Word document.

NOTE: Word must be in Page Layout View (on the View menu, click Page Layout) for
you to see columns.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use columns in a Word document (on the Format menu, click Columns),
Word inserts newspaper-style columns. That is, the text in a column wraps from
the bottom of one column to the top of the next column.

To move the insertion point from one column to the next or to the previous column
on the same page, use the keyboard keys as described in the following table.
When you move the insertion point by using shortcut keys, Word will move the
insertion point to the top of the next or to the top of the previous column.

   To move on the same page        Press
   ----------------------------------------------

   To the next column              ALT+DOWN ARROW

   To the previous column          ALT+UP ARROW

NOTE: Even though you may have formatted your document to have two (or more)
columns, the additional columns will not yet exist and the shortcut keys to move
to the next or to the previous column may not work until there is enough text in
your document to wrap into the additional columns or until you insert a column
break. To insert a column break, on the Insert menu, click Break, select Column
Break, and then click OK.
