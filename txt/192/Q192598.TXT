SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Windows 98 on your computer and then attempt to
connect to MSN, you are prompted to upgrade your software for MSN, The Microsoft
Network. When the upgrade is finished and you double-click the MSN icon on the
desktop, the MSN Sign-In screen is not populated with your MSN Member ID,
password, or access numbers.

CAUSE

This behavior occurs because the Connection Manager is not able to retrieve the
MSN account settings from previous MSN dialers.

1. In the User Name box, type your MSN Member ID.

   the Password box and follow the instructions on the screen to request a new
   MSN password.
