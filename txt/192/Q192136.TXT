======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Installing an Add-in Project via a Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW)
distribution package (Setup.Exe) causes the following error:

   Your Add-in (<NameOfYourAddin>.DLL) could not be registered

A similar error message occurs if you uninstall the Add-in via Add/Remove
Programs in Control Panel. During the uninstall process, the following error
occurs:

   Your Add-in (<NameOfYourAddin>.DLL) could not be unregistered

CAUSE
=====

If you build an Add-in Project and use the Package and Deployment Wizard to
create a distribution set, the Package and Deployment Wizard does not
automatically include the Add-in run-time file, MSAddndr.DLL, in the
distribution set.

RESOLUTION
==========

For most cases, the distribution set for an Add-in Project does not need to
include the Add-in run-time MSAddndr.DLL because Visual Basic installs the
Add-in run-time during its setup. Because Visual Basic is needed to run a Visual
Basic Add-in, it is only necessary to include MSAddndr.DLL in the distribution
set if the end-user of the Add-in is likely to not have Visual Basic already
installed.

To include the Add-in run-time MSAddndr.DLL to a Package and Deployment Wizard
distribution set, add the file in the list of Included Files.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Open an existing Visual Basic project for which a Distribution set is to be
   created.

2. From the Add-In menu, select Package and Deployment Wizard. (If Package and
   Deployment Wizard is not listed, the Package and Deployment Wizard Add-In
   will need to be loaded first. To load the Add-In, choose Add-In Manager from
   the Add-In menu. In the Add-In Manager dialog box, select Package and
   Deployment Wizard, and then select the Loaded/Unloaded check box.)

3. Click on the Package button.

4. Choose the appropriate Packaging Script, and click Next.

5. Choose the appropriate Package type, and click Next.

6. Choose the appropriate Package Folder, and click Next.

7. Add "MSAddndr.DLL" (without the quotation marks) to the list of Included
   files by clicking Add and selecting MSAddndr.DLL. Assuming Visual Basic is
   installed onto the C: Drive, MSAddndr.DLL can be found in the C:\Program
   Files\Common Files\Designer folder.
