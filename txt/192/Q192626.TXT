SYMPTOMS
========

Adding a method to an ATL class generates the following compile time error:

   MIDL2269 : procedures in an object interface must return an HRESULT

CAUSE
=====

The method implements a custom interface, does not use the [local] attribute,
and does not return a value of type HRESULT.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the [local] attribute to either the interface or the method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.
