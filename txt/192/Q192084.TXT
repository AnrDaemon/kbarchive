TITLE   :X400: Incorrect Date on Message Sent Through X.400 Gateway
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, you may
experience one or more of the following symptoms:

 - When you view the message in a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks client, the
   date on the message may appear incorrectly. This problem also occurs if the
   MS Mail (PC) postoffice returns the message because it cannot be delivered,
   and then you view the returned message in an MS Mail (PC) client. For
   example, if the message is sent on January 1, 2000, the date appears as "a
   700:00 relative to GMT" (without quotation marks) instead of "Jan 01 1:00:00
   2000 -08:00 relative to GMT."

 - When you view the date on the message in the Inbox, the date may appear
   incorrectly. For example, if the message is sent on January 1, 2000, the date
   appears as "12/10/09" (without quotation marks) instead of "1/1/00."

This problem is not likely to occur before the year 2000.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 does not properly convert two-digit years to
four digits for the year 2000.
