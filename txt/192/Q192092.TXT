 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a graphic that was created in PhotoShop 5.0 for the Macintosh
into Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, you may see one of the following message
boxes instead of the actual graphic:

   QuickTime and a Photo - JPEG decompressor are needed to see this picture

   -or-

   QuickTime Logo that displays "QuickTime PICT"

You may also see this message when you open a Word 98 Macintosh Edition document
that contains this type of graphic in Word 97 for Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs with graphics that are created on the Macintosh platform.
The Windows PICT filter cannot translate Macintosh PICT files that use the
QuickTime or photo-JPEG compression method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert Macintosh PICT graphics into a document, Word uses the PICT
filter. If the filter is not installed or is damaged, the following message will
appear:

   A graphics filter that can read this graphic file is not installed on your
   computer.

Additionally the problem occurs when the graphic is saved as 32-bit or 16- bit
image with compression.
