======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Regsvr32 may fail when registering a debug build of an MFC Server. The error
message box may contain the following message:

   The ordinal 3300 could not be located in the dynamic link library
   MFCO42D.DLL.

The ordinal number may vary.

If you click OK, another error message may appear stating:

   RegSvr32: LoadLibrary("<server name>") failed.
   GetLastError returns 0x000000b6.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs because the Debug MFC DLL's are not binary-compatible between
Visual C++ 5.0 and Visual C++ 6.0. If the user has written a debug build DLL in
Visual C++ 5.0 and attempts to register it on a machine that has Visual C++ 6.0,
then the error will appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following are three possible workarounds:

 - Build a release version of the server in Visual C++ 5.0 and run it on the
   target Visual C++ 6.0 machine.

 - Rebuild the Server using Visual C++ 6.0.

 - Copy the MFC debug DLLs from VC++ 5.0 to the same directory on the target
   machine as the MFC ActiveX server (for diagnostic purposes only because
   redistribution violates the Visual C++ license agreement).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
