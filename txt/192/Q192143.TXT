The user can work around this problem by trapping the Data Control's error event
and repositioning to an existing record after the seek failure.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a DataControl, Label, and CommandButton on the form.

3. Set the following Properties of the controls:

         DataConrol(Data1)
         [DatabaseName]   :Biblio.mdb
         [RecordsetType]  :0 - Table
         [RecordSource]   :Authors

         Label(Label1)
         [DataSource]     :Data1
         [DataField]      :Author

4. Add the following code to the CommandButton's Click event:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()

          Data1.Recordset.Index = "PrimaryKey"
          Data1.Recordset.Seek "=", 0     'so that NoMatch=True
          Print Data1.Recordset.NoMatch

         End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to execute code, and note that the "No Current Record" error
   is returned on the Seek method.
