-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

If you specify more than one gateway in the TCP/IP Properties dialog box,
gateway addresses other than the default gateway address may not be used if the
default gateway is not available.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) stack included with Windows 95 only uses the default gateway.

95. For information about how to do so, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

2.5, and in Microsoft Windows 98.
