======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Dial-Up Networking connection from your Windows 95- based
computer to another computer that is configured to disconnect after a connection
is inactive for a specific period of time, your computer may not disconnect
automatically. Note that this behavior may occur even if you use the "Disconnect
a call if idle for more than <number> minutes" option in the Modems tool
in Control Panel to limit the amount of time a connection may be inactive before
it is automatically disconnected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks
service is installed and your computer has the Browse Master feature enabled, or
Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) is enabled on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Disable the Browse Master feature. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network.

2. Click the Configuration tab, click the "File and printer sharing for
   Microsoft Networks" entry, and then click Properties.

3. In the Properties box, click Browse Master. In the Value box, click Disabled,
   and then click OK.

NOTE: At least one computer in a workgroup must have the ability to become the
master browse server. If browse server capability is disabled on all computers
in a workgroup, browse functionality is also disabled.

Method 2
--------

Disable the bindings for the File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks
service on the Dial-Up adapter. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Network.

2. Click the Configuration tab, click TCP/IP-->Dial-Up Adapter, and then
   click Properties.

3. In the Properties box, click the Bindings tab.

4. Click to clear the "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" check
   box, and then click OK.

5. Repeat steps 2-3 for each protocol bound to the Dial-Up adapter.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
