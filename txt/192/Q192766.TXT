Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

ADSI is a Component Object Model (COM) based interface for accessing directory
services. Each element of the network, such as users, printers and computers,
can be treated as an object. The form ADSBrows demonstrates how to find an
Active Directory Services (ADS) container object as well as the objects
contained within that container.

To use ADSBrows, run ADSIBrow.exe to extract the form files. Run the form from
within Visual FoxPro by typing the following in the Command window:

      DO FORM ADSBROWS

In the ADS Path text box, change MyServer to a valid computer name for your
network and click the Find button. If all of the Filters check boxes are clear,
the browser displays all ADS objects for the computer name entered. The browser
allows a user to drill down the object tree by clicking the plus sign to the
left of an object.

If any Filters check boxes are selected, the browser displays those objects that
match the selected check boxes. In other words, if Users and Printers are
checked, the browser displays the users and printers for the computer name
entered.

To view the properties for an object, select it in the Treeview list and click
the Properties button. When the Properties button is clicked, the selected
object's name, class, GUID and ADS path display.

NOTE: In order to use the sample, you must install the Active Directory Service
Interfaces. The Active Directory Service Interfaces can be installed from one of
the following:

 - http://www.microsoft.com/windows/server/Technical/directory/
 - Microsoft Developer Network CD-ROM
