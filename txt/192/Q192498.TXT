TITLE   :SMS: Repackage of Netscape Communicator 4.03 Fails to Show Icons
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer to do a repackage of
Netscape Communicator 4.03 Pro, the installation fails in several ways depending
on the platform. On Microsoft Windows NT systems, the icons created by the
Systems Management Server Installer do not correspond to those created by the
actual Netscape installation.

The problem occurs when the shortcut icon number generated by the Systems
Management Server Installer is greater than 127 in the installation expert. When
the number exceeds 127 and you click OK in the Installation Expert, you are
prompted to enter a number between 0 and 127, even though Installation Expert
put the higher number in the icon number field.

This occurs because the Installation Expert uses 7 bits to represent an icon
number, when it should be a 16-bit value.

On Microsoft Windows 95 computers, the failures are similar to those on Microsoft
Windows NT. In addition, a sub-group of the Netscape Start Menu is not created
on the Microsoft Windows 95 systems.

A "Normal" Netscape installation creates a Netscape Communicator Professional
Edition program group and also creates a subgroup called Utilities when it is
installed on either Windows NT or Windows 95. When repackaging Netscape under
Windows 95, the Utilities group is not created; all the items that are normally
installed in this group are placed in the Netscape Communicator Professional
Edition group (with incorrect icons).

CAUSE
=====

The icon numbers for each installation are as follows:

                            SMS Installer   Netscape (Actual)
   Icon Name                 Icon Number       Icon Number
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   IBM Host On-Demand              4                5
   Collabra                       31                4
   Composer                      155                3
   Messenger                     187               11
   Navigator                     254                1
   Netcaster                      28                6
   User Profile Manager           27                7

This problem has the potential of occurring with every icon that has a value
greater than 127.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer builds 1.0.24 and earlier for Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95.
