SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Visual Basic for Applications macro to print a document, the
document will not start printing until the macro ends.

CAUSE
=====

Background printing is turned on. The default value for the Background printing
method is True.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must set the Background printing option to False in your code. To do this,
use the following macro:

      Sub PrintDoc()
         ActiveDocument.PrintOut Background:=False
      End Sub

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following macro will give the command to print; however, the document will
not actually print until you click OK in the message box.

      Sub PrintDoc()
         ActiveDocument.PrintOut Background:=True
         Msgbox "Test"
      End Sub

The following macro will print the document before you click OK:

      Sub PrintDoc()
         ActiveDocument.PrintOut Background:=False
         Msgbox "Test"
      End Sub

NOTE: If you do not specify a Background argument, it automatically assumes a
True value.
