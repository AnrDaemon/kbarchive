   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to install Exchange Server 5.5, or running Update.exe for
Exchange 5.5 Service Pack 1, you may receive the error message:

   Missing entry points in Gapi32.dll

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when there is a mismatch between an existing version of Gapi32.dll
and the version that Update.exe or Setup.exe is expecting.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
      Manager\KnownDLLs

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
   value:

      Value Name: Gapi32
      Data Type:  REG_SZ
      Value:      Gapi32.dll

4. Quit Registry Editor.

You must restart your computer for this change to take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error mentioned in the "Symptoms" portion of this article can be noted
during an upgrade to Exchange Server version 5.5 or a new installation to
Exchange Server version 5.5, as well as during the service pack update.

Placing the missing entry in the registry allows the software program to proceed
normally.
