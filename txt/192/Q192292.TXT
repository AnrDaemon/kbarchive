TITLE   :Unpredictable TCP Sequence Numbers in SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFEA kbWinNT400sp4fea

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The TCP protocol assigns an initial sequence number to each connection. Prior to
Service Pack 4, it is possible, through careful analysis, to determine the
initial TCP sequence number for a specific Windows NT communications session. By
predicting a TCP session's sequence number, it could be possible to disrupt the
integrity of a communication session that does not provide its own session
integrity. This is often referred to as "connection hijacking."

In Service Pack 4, the method of assigning sequence numbers to TCP session has
changed to make them more unpredictable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT version
4.0. For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.
