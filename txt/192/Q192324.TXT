TITLE   :XADM: Dumpster Size Performance Monitor Value Wraps Prematurely
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The value of the Performance Monitor counter, MSExchangeIS Private - Total size
of recoverable items, displays the incorrect value and then resets to zero when
the total dumpster size increases beyond 2 gigabytes (GB).

CAUSE
=====

The information store holds this value in bytes. When the information store
provides the value for Performance Monitor, it needs to convert the value into
kilobytes, and copy it. There was a code defect in the way the original value
was being converted and copied.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
