TITLE   :BUG: Setting OptionButton Value to True Sets TabStop to True
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the Value property of an OptionButton equal to True, either by setting
it through code or clicking the radio button, the TabStop property is also set
to True.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a CommandButton and an OptionButton to Form1.

3. Add the following code to the form module:

         Sub Form_Load()
            Option1.TabStop = False
         End Sub

         Sub Form_Click()
            Option1.Value = True
            Debug.Print Option1.TabStop
         End Sub

4. Save the project and run it.

5. Press the TAB key and note that you cannot tab between controls.

6. Now click on the Form, which will set the Value property of the OptionButton
   equal to True. The same behavior will occur if the OptionButton is clicked
   with the mouse.

7. Press the TAB key again. Note this time that you are able to tab to the
   OptionButton. This occurs because setting the Value property to True sets the
   TabStop property to True.

8. To work around this bug, reset the TabStop property equal to False after the
   Value property is set to True. In design-mode, modify the Form Click event to
   look similar to the following:

         Sub Form_Click()
            Option1.Value = True
            Option1.TabStop = False
            Debug.Print Option1.TabStop
         End Sub

9. Repeat steps 4-7, and note that the OptionButton is never in the tabbing
   sequence.
