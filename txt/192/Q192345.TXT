TITLE   :FIX: DISPLAY/LIST DLLS NOCONSOLE Echo to Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the LIST DLLS or DISPLAY DLLS commands with the NOCONSOLE clause, the
.dlls still echo to the FoxPro screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the NOCONSOLE clause in supported FoxPro commands, prevents the
information from displaying to the FoxPro screen. Unfortunately, the LIST DLLS
and DISPLAY DLLS commands echo the information back to the FoxPro screen.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, type the following commands:

         DECLARE INTEGER GetActiveWindow IN WIN32API  && Ensures that a dll
                                                     &&  displays.
         LIST STATUS TO FILE mystats.txt NOCONSOLE
         LIST DLLS TO FILE mydlls2.txt NOCONSOLE

Note that the FoxPro status does not appear on the FoxPro screen, however, any
dlls in use, display on the screen.
