TITLE   :SMS: Network Monitor: "Bad Month Format"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsnetmon

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Network Monitor Agent to do a remote capture, viewing the captured
frame properties reveals the following:

   FRAME: Time of capture = Bad Month Format 0, 0 0:0:0.13

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only when you are using Network Monitor Agent to capture
from a remote computer, not when capturing locally from the computer that
Network Monitor is installed on.

When captured locally, the frame properties should read correctly:

   FRAME: Time of capture = Jul 20, 1998 11:45:36.880

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use Network Monitor Agent on the local computer
rather than attempting to perform a remote capture.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
