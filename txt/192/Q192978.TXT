TITLE   :PRB: Query Output to Label or Report Prints All Records
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Create a new query and make the query output destination a label or a report
that was created using the Label Wizard. When you run the query all of the
records are printed, instead of the records that you selected in the query.

CAUSE
=====

The label or report has a table in the label or report's Data Environment.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the table from the label or report's Data Environment.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a new query is created, the user has the option to choose an output
destination by right-clicking the Query Designer and choosing Output Settings.
If a report or label is chosen, the user is prompted to either enter a file name
or to create a new label or report using the Wizard. If the report or label is
created using the Wizard, the user is prompted for a table, which is placed in
the Data Environment of the label or report.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new query using the Query Designer. Add a table to the query when
   prompted.

2. Right-click in the Query Designer and Select "Output Settings...".

3. Select either a report or a label.

4. In the Query Destination dialog box, select the Builder button that is
   located to the immediate right of the Open Report/Label text box.

5. Follow the steps to create a report or label, selecting the table that you
   added to the query in Step 1. Add the fields when prompted and then click OK
   to close the Query Destination dialog box.

6. In the Query Designer, click the Filter tab and create a filter that limits
   the records the query returns.

7. Right-click the Query Designer and then select Run Query.

RESULTS: All of the records are returned in the report or label instead of the
subset you selected.
