TITLE   :SMSINST: ODBC Data Source May Fail to Be Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Systems Management Server Installer executable file does not correctly install
an ODBC Data Source when using the Configure ODBC Data Source script item in the
Systems Management Server Installer script editor. No warnings or errors are
displayed or logged.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if invalid or blank entries are included in the Data
Source Attributes section of the Configure ODBC Data Source script item. During
runtime, Systems Management Server Installer recognizes invalid information
included in this section, and does not configure the Data Source. However, the
Systems Management Server Installer also fails to display or log an error that
it encountered the problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, verify that the Data Source Attributes section of
the Configure ODBC Data Source script item does not contain any invalid
entries.

For example, note that you should not include "Driver=" or "User=" entries,
because these are considered invalid (because the script item adds these for you
automatically).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0.
