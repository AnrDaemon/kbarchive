TITLE   :SMSINST: Runtime I/O Error When Calling a Program
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error can also occur if you have bad media, file corruption, or other I/O
errors when reading a file. If you receive this message and your Installer
script is not using the "Execute Program" action, this can indicate possible
corruption of the source files for the program being repackaged. You should
follow standard troubleshooting steps to confirm what the problem is and how to
correct it.

SYMPTOMS
========

When calling another program from a Systems Management Server Installer script,
the following error may appear in a dialog box at run time:

   Error when executing SMS Package : An I/O error occurred while installing a
   file. This is normally caused by bad installation media or a corrupt
   installation file. <Abort><Retry>

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs if the Installer script is using the "Execute Program" action
and the "Wait for program to exit" check box is not selected. The Installer
script tries to continue processing, but the program being executed has a file
in use that the Installer script needs.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your script uses the "Execute Program" action, you may be able to resolve the
problem by selecting the "Wait for program to exit" check box in the "Execute
Program" action which calls the other program.
