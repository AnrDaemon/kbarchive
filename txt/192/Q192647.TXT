SUMMARY
=======

In accordance with the specifications for building and exposing ActiveX
controls, Visual Basic uses a resource file to store the toolbox bitmaps for
each UserControl in a compiled OCX. Design-time clients can then load and
display these bitmap images in a "control toolbox" without having to load or
create running instances of these controls.

By default, Visual Basic stores these images with a base resource identifier
starting at 30000. Consequently, when adding your own resource file to a Visual
Basic ActiveX control project, you should avoid using resource IDs that might
conflict with these values.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The toolbox image resource ID for a UserControl is registered on the system in
the ToolboxBitmap32 registry key under the CLSID for the control.
