======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a program that uses Windows sockets over the IPX/SPX protocol to
transfer large quantities of datagrams, you may receive either of the following
error messages:

   - An exception 0E has occurred at 0028:C1029F6C in VxD
   WSIPX(01) +00000DBC.
   This was called from 0028:C0043174 in VxD NDIS(01) +00000D7C

   - A fatal exception has occurred at 0028:C10297D1 in VxD
   WSIPX(01)+00000621.
   The current application will be terminated.

Also, your computer may stop responding (hang), or the client process on the
remote computer may report transmission errors. Note that this problem is more
likely to occur with slower computers.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a buffer being used by a Windows sockets program is
inadvertently freed twice by Windows Network Sockets for IPX (WSIPX) and the
IPX/SPX-compatible protocol (NWLINK) then tries to access this buffer.



RESOLUTION
==========

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.


MORE INFORMATION
