======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.5, 2.51, 2.52, 2.6 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view the contents of the Inbox in Microsoft Outlook Express,
you may receive the following error message:

   Msimn caused an invalid page fault in module Msimnui.dll.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Inbox.idx file and possibly the folders.nch file,
used in Outlook Express 4.0 and earlier, are damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, we recommend that you first upgrade to the latest version
of Outlook Express. Outlook Express 5.0 and later do not use the file which is
causing this problem.

Outlook Express comes as part of MSN versions 5.5 and earlier. Outlook Express
also comes as part of Internet Explorer, which you can upgrade by going to
http://www.microsoft.com/ie/

If upgrading is not a possibility, to resolve this issue, rebuild the Inbox.idx
and folders.nch files:

1. Quit Outlook Express.

2. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

3. In the Named box, type inbox.idx folders.nch, and then click Find Now.

4. Right-click the Inbox.idx file, click Rename, and then type inbox.idx.old and
   press Enter.

5. Right-click the folders.nch file, click Rename, and then type folders.nch.old
   and press Enter.

6. Close the Find: Files Named Inbox.idx window, and then restart your computer.

The next time you start Outlook Express, the program automatically rebuilds these
files.

Note: You may also need to rename the Inbox.mbx. If the issue persists, follow
the steps above to rename the Inbox.mbx file.
