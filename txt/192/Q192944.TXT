-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using Windows 98 and Visual Basic 5.0 SP3, attempting to bring up the custom
property page for the Kodak Imaging Controls results in the following error:

   "Class not registered: Looking for object with CLSID
   0BE35201-8F91-11CE-9DE3-00AA004BB851".

CAUSE
=====

This CLSID corresponds to the stock "Color Property Page" found in MFC42.DLL.
The DLL that contains this property page has not been registered correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using REGSVR32.EXE as follows to unregister and then re-register MFC42.DLL will
place the correct entries into the system registry and allow the property page
for ImgEdit, which makes use of the stock Color Property Page, to be displayed:

Unregister MFC42.DLL as follows:

      regsvr32.exe -u MFC42.DLL

Re-register MFC42.DLL as follows:

      regsvr32.exe MFC42.DLL

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is a problem for any Kodak Imaging Control that makes use of the stock
Color Property Page. These are:

   ImgThumbnail
   ImgAnnTool
   ImgEdit

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a freshly-configured machine with Windows 98 and Visual Basic 5.0 SP3,
   create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Choose Components from the Project menu to show the Components Dialog.

3. Check "Kodak Image Edit Control" and click OK.

4. Place an instance of the Image Edit control on Form1.

5. Alternate-click and select "Properties." If MFC42.DLL is not properly
   registered, you see the following message dialog box:

   "Class not registered: Looking for object with CLSID
   0BE35201-8F91-11CE-9DE3-00AA004BB851".
