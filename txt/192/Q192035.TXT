TITLE   :PRB: Do Not Use a WebClass ProcessTag Inside an HTML Tag
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInternet kbVBp kbVBp600 kbWebClasses kbGrpDSASP kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A WebClass page does not display in the browser or is not displayed as expected.

CAUSE
=====

You cannot use WebClass ProcessTags within an HTML tag because the design- time
parser does not interpret it correctly.


RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to use a WebClass ProcessTag for the entire HTML tag or do not
put ProcessTags inside HTML tags.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Notice in the code below from a HTML page that there is a WebClass ProcessTag
called <WC@Replace> with an ending </WC@Replace> located within an
HTML INPUT tag. This will not work because you have WebClass ProcessTag inside a
HTML tag.

      <INPUT id="ReplaceField" NAME="ReplaceField" SIZE=39 MAXLENGTH=50 value=
      "<WC@Replace>sss</WC@Replace>">

Workaround
----------

1. Place your WebClass ProcessTag within the HTML page, but not inside of a HTML
   Tag. For example:

         <HTML>
         <BODY>
         <WC@Replace>sss</WC@Replace>
         </BODY>
         <HTML>

2. Write code to process the ProcessTag in your WebClass ProcessTag procedure.
   Here is some sample code:

         Private Sub Template3_ProcessTag(ByVal TagName As String, _
                                  TagContents As String, SendTags As Boolean)
           TagContents = "<INPUT id=ReplaceField NAME=ReplaceField SIZE=39 _
                                  MAXLENGTH=50 value=sss>"
         End Sub
