TITLE   :PRB: Controls Not Getting Focus After Clicking IE Address Area
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbActiveDocs kbIE kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

The edit or text region of any control (including text boxes, edit boxes,
spinners and combo boxes) in an ActiveDocument does not regain focus after
selecting the Address region in Internet Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Try clicking outside of Internet Explorer. For instance, click the Windows
Desktop, and then select the text or edit region of the control again in the
ActiveDocument to regain focus.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project, named Myactivedoc.

2. Create a form, named Myform.

3. Add a few controls to the form, like text boxes, edit boxes, spinners and
   combo boxes.

4. Save and add the form to the project.

5. Create a class, named Myclass, based on ActiveDoc.

6. Place the following code in the Run event of the ActiveDoc class:

      DO FORM myform
      READ EVENT

7. Place the following code in the ContainerRelease event:

      CLEAR EVENT

8. Save the class as Myactivecls.vcx and add it to the project.

9. Make sure Myactivecls.vcx is "Set To Main" before you build the application.

10. Now, click the Build button and select Build Application to build an
   application.

11. From the Tools menu, select Run Active Document and type in Myactivedoc.app.

12. Once Myactivedoc.app is hosted in Internet Explorer, click around all the
   controls and try typing something in the controls. You can type into the
   text or edit region and move from control to control.

13. Now, click the Address drop-down or type something in the Address text box
   region in Internet Explorer.

The cursor remains in the last control that you clicked or typed in and cannot be
moved to the Address region even if you have selected the Address region. Now,
click back on the last control used before you clicked the Address region and
start typing again. The text that you type appears in the Address region in
Internet Explorer and not in the actual control that contains the cursor.
