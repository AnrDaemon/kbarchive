TITLE   :Windows NT Load Balancing Service Remote Control Commands Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) remote control commands are
invoked from a system outside the cluster, no response is received from one or
more cluster hosts.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by one of the following:

 - The cluster network interface cards (NICs) are not reachable from the outside
   system. If you have multiple NICs on a cluster host, the dedicated NIC may be
   on a separate subnet from the cluster NIC. If you invoke a remote control
   command from an outside system on this subnet, the cluster NICs and WLBS
   driver will not receive the command.

 - Remote control commands are sent to a secondary cluster IP address. Commands
   must be sent to the cluster's primary IP address (which is entered in the
   WLBS Setup dialog box).

 - WLBS's UDP control port is blocked by a firewall. By default, remote control
   commands are sent to UDP port 1717 at the cluster IP address. You can also
   change the port number by modifying the corresponding WLBS registry
   parameter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods that correspond to the
cause listed above:

 - Be sure that the cluster NICs on the cluster hosts can be reached by the
   outside system.

-or-

 - Be sure that you send remote commands to the secondary cluster IP address.

-or-

 - Be sure that UDP port 1717 has not been blocked by a router or firewall.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT Load Balancing Service is configurable from a remote location by
copying the control program (WLBS.exe) to any Windows NT device.
