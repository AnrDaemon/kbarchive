SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to migrate from the Microsoft Mail Macintosh client to Exchange
using the Macintosh Mail Source Extractor and then using the Migration Wizard to
generate the PSTs (personal folder files), you may see that some of the PSTs are
corrupt. When you click on the Inbox in an Outlook client, the Inbox hangs
Outlook at 100 percent CPU.

The Macintosh Mail Source Extractor did not convert CRs to CR/LF pairs,
resulting in an invalid message.
