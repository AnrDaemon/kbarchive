OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMDAC kbODBC kbOracle kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5 Build 2.573.2927 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you call an Oracle package.procedure that does not take any parameters the
Microsoft Oracle ODBC driver returns the following error message:

   SYNTAX ERROR OR ACCESS VIOLATION


RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this behavior, create a package.procedure that takes a parameter,
but does nothing with the parameter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In SQL*PLUS run the following Oracle PL/SQL code:


   create or replace package pack1 is
   procedure proc1;
   end pack1;
   / 

   create or replace package body pack1 is
   procedure proc1 is
   begin
     insert into department values (50,'RESEARCH', 124);
   end proc1;
   end pack1;
   / 

To reproduce the error use the following Visual Basic code in a push button Click
event. Make sure that the Visual Basic project has the Microsoft ActiveX Data
Objects Library selected in the REFERENCES

      Private Sub Command2_Click()
         Dim cmd As ADODB.Command
         Dim rst As ADODB.Recordset
         Dim m_session As ADODB.Connection
         Set m_session = New ADODB.Connection
         m_session.CursorLocation = adUseClient
         ' Replace "***" with your own Oracle DSN
         m_session.Open "DSN=***", "demo", "demo"
         Set cmd = New ADODB.Command
         cmd.ActiveConnection = m_session
         cmd.CommandText = "pack1.proc1"
         cmd.CommandType = adCmdStoredProc
         cmd.Execute
      End Sub
