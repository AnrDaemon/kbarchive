MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. From the File menu, add an ActiveX Control project. UserControl1 is created
   by default.

3. Bring up UserControl1 in the Visual Basic IDE. Select "Menu Editor" from the
   Tools menu.

4. Add the following menu structure to UserControl1, making sure to uncheck the
   Visible CheckBox on the Menu Editor:

         Menu1
         ---Sub1
         Menu2   (Visible = False)
         ---Sub2

5. In the Menu Editor, set the NegotiatePosition property to Left for Menu1 and
   Menu2 (top-level menus).

6. Close the UserControl1 design window, and add an instance of UserControl1 to
   Form1 of the Standard EXE project.

7. Add the following code to the Form1 module:

         Private Sub Sub1_Click()
            Menu1.Visible = False
            Menu2.Visible = True
         End Sub

         Private Sub Sub2_Click()
            Menu2.Visible = False
            Menu1.Visible = True
         End Sub

8. Save the Project group and run it. Select "Sub1" from the "Menu1" menu. Note
   that Menu2 does not become visible, nor does Menu1 disappear.
