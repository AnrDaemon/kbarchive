TITLE   :SMSINST: Services Not Installed with Repackage of Norton AV 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Systems Management Server Installer 1.0 to repackage Norton Antivirus
4.0 for Windows NT 4.0, some services do not appear to be installed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Installer writes incorrect security information is
written to the registry under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\. This causes kernel mode
driver services related to Norton Anti-Virus to fail at startup. This is due to
the Repackage process in Systems Management Server Installer capturing
installation-specific security information for the reference computer. This
information is invalid for target systems; the Create Service driver will
correctly create this information for each target system at run-time.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. After the repackage, but before compiling, modify the Edit Registry action in
   the Script Editor view of the Systems Management Server Installer. You should
   modify this script item so that it does not write to the registry keys under
   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services related to Norton Anti-Virus services.
   The Create Service script action takes care of creating these keys.

2. Complete by compiling and installing on a clean computer.

After performing these steps, note that the services, including the SYMEVENT
kernel driver service, now start properly.
