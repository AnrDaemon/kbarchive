TITLE   :XADM: Event Service with Internet Explorer 4.01 Hangs NT Shell
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you right-click the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop, select
Properties, and click OK, the Windows NT logon shell (Explorer.exe) hangs. This
happens when you have Internet Explorer 4.01 and Exchange Server build 1960 (or
later) installed on a clean Windows NT Server 4.0 with Service Pack 3.

CAUSE
=====

Explorer.exe sends a windows broadcast message to all top-level windows awaiting
response. In the Exchange Server event service, the broadcast message is missed
by one of the COM threads and another thread is performing "if (Peek..." instead
of "while(Peek," missing the message completely, which results in Internet
Explorer hanging.

version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
