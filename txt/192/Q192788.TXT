TITLE   :SMS: Wuser32 Leaks Memory After UDP Port 1762 Attack
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a utility to send packets to UDP port 1762, the Systems Management
Server Remote Control Agent (Wuser32.exe) will rapidly allocate memory. This
will continue until either no more memory can be allocated or the Systems
Management Server Remote Control Agent is stopped.

RESOLUTION
==========


A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Replace the Wuser32.exe file in the

   <SMS_root_directory>\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\<platform>.bin

   directory with the hotfixed version.

2. Replace the Multprot.dll file in the

   <SMS_root_directory>\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\<platform>.bin

   directory with the hotfixed version.

3. Maintenance manager will replicate the updated files to the

   Logon.srv\<platform>.bin directory on the Systems Management Server

   logon servers during its next work cycle. After that occurs, you can update
   the clients. To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each
   client or follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   Q166771 SMS: How to Force Site-Wide Client Updates

NOTE: For consistency, Multprot.dll should also be updated in the
<SMS_root_directory>\Site.srv\<platform>.bin on the Systems
Management Server site server, as well as on any computers running the Systems
Management Server Administrator tools.
