MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a reference to "Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Library." Also, under
   Project/Components, add "Microsoft ADO Data Control 6.0 (OLEDB)."

3. Add a CommandButton and ADO data control to Form1.

4. Make sure that you have a DSN for the SQL Server Northwind database called
   "Northwind."

5. Paste the following code in the General Declarations section:

         Dim Conn As ADODB.Connection
         Dim MainRS As ADODB.Recordset

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim XRs as ADODB.Recordset

            Set Conn = New ADODB.Connection
            Conn.ConnectionString = "Provider=MSDataShape.1;Data Provider=MSDASQL;" & _
            "Data Source=Northwind; uid=<user>; pwd=<password>;"
            Conn.Open

            Set MainRS = New ADODB.Recordset
            MainRS.CursorLocation = adUseClient

            Call MainRS.Open(" SHAPE {SELECT * FROM `Customers` WHERE
            CustomerID = 'ALFKI'}  AS Customer APPEND ({SELECT * FROM
            `Orders`}  AS OrderChapter RELATE 'CustomerID' TO 'CustomerID') AS
            CustomerOrders", Conn, adOpenStatic, adLockBatchOptimistic)

            Set XRs = MainRs.Fields("CustomerOrders").Value
            Set adodc1.recordset = XRs

         End Sub

6. Click on the CommandButton and note that the error above is returned.
