TITLE   :SNABase Service Fails to Start on SNA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0 SP3,4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNABase service may not start initially but can be started manually after
the system completes startup. In addition, an event ID 590 may be logged in the
application event log.

CAUSE
=====

The SNABase service cannot start until all dependency services have completed
initialization. The SNABase service is designed to time out if the dependency
services do not start after 10 seconds. SNA Server's SNABase service is
dependent upon the following services:

   Workstation, Server, and NT LM Security Support Provider

If any of these other services do not start in a timely fashion, the SNABase
service will not be able to start, and an event ID 590 may be logged in the
application event log.

RESOLUTION
==========

--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
