The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 98 Research Organizer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Encarta 98 Research Organizer, if you save the
Rosetup.exe installation file to the hard disk, and then double-click the saved
file, you may receive the following error message:

   Setup could not open the DLL C:\WINDOWS\DESKTOP\ENCINST.DLL. Close all open
   windows and applications and run Setup again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Encarta 98 Research Organizer installation
program is designed to be run directly from the Encarta 98 Research Organizer
CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install Encarta 98 Research Organizer directly from the
Encarta 98 Research Organizer CD-ROM. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Encarta 98 Research Organizer CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. Press
   and hold down the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the Encarta
   98 Research Organizer Web page from loading automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

      <drive>:\ro\rosetup.exe

   where <drive> is the letter of the CD-ROM drive that contains the
   Encarta 98 Research Organizer CD-ROM.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Encarta 98 Research
   Organizer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert the Encarta 98 Research Organizer CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive,
your default Web browser loads the Encarta 98 Research Organizer Web page on the
CD-ROM.

"Click here to install Encarta 98 Research Organizer" Web link, you are prompted

location," and then click OK.

If Netscape Navigator is your default Web browser, however, when you click the
"Click here to install Encarta 98 Research Organizer" Web link, you are prompted
to select the folder in which to store the file and cannot run the file from the
Encarta 98 Research Organizer CD-ROM.
