======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows Terminal Server client, if you open an MS-DOS window, go to
Properties and click to select Full Screen, nothing happens and properties are
reset to window.

CAUSE
=====

Full screen mode requires the loading of font sets. This was deemed too
intensive an activity to allow in the client because performance would suffer
greatly.

STATUS
======

This feature is by design.
