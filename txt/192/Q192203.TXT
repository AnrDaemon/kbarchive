PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5,5.5 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc55 exc55sp1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) message is received by a Microsoft
Exchange Server computer, an event may appear in the event log with the message
ID missing from the description. For example, an event similar to the following
may appear in the event log:

   Event: 12034
   Source: MSExchange NNTP
   Type: Warning
   Category: Content Engine
   Description: Message <> from '<sender>' had to be reprocessed due to
   error 80040C10-F2000200.

where <sender> is the person who sent the message. The message ID is
missing from the description even if the original NNTP message contained a valid
message ID. Note that the last eight hexadecimal digits of the error listed in
the description may also be F0000000, F2000210, or F200024C.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the message ID is not recorded before the event is
logged.

RESOLUTION
==========
