The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A wait window with the message "Numeric Overflow" occurs if a text box that is
set to a currency field does not have a decimal place in the Input Mask
property. If the Input Mask has settings that include a decimal place or if
there are no settings at all, the wait window does not appear. To trigger the
wait window "Numeric Overflow" message, the data in the text box has to be
highlighted and deleted. Moving off of the text box causes the wait window to
appear.

CAUSE
=====

A decimal place is missing in the Inputmask property of the text box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add a table that has a currency field in it to the data
   environment of the form.

2. Add a text box to the form and set the ControlSource of the text box to the
   currency field and add enough nines (9's) to the InputMask property of the
   text box to hold all of the values in the currency field. Make sure there is
   no decimal place.

3. Run the form and highlight all data in the text box. Press the Delete key to
   empty the text box, and press the Tab key to move off of the text box to
   trigger the message.

4. A numeric value must be typed into the text box so the form can be closed.

5. Modify the form, adding a decimal place to the right of one of the nines
   (9's) in the Input Mask property of the text box. Run the form and follow
   step 3 again. Note that the error does not occur.
