Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project called MyTest in a new directory.

2. Create a new program file in the project and place in the following code:

         DEFINE CLASS MyClass AS CUSTOM OLEPUBLIC
            PROCEDURE MyProc
            LPARAMETERS cParm1, cIniFile, nPersistInstance
               nPersistInstance = 0
               RETURN "<HTML><BODY><b>cParm1= </b>" + cParm1 + ;
               "<br><b>cIniFile= </b>" + cIniFile + ;
               "<br><b>nPersistInstance= <b>" + ;
               STR(nPersistInstance) + "</BODY></HTML>"
            ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

3. Build the project into MyTest.exe.

4. Place the following files into the INetPub\Scripts directory:

   MyTest.exe
   FoxISAPI.dll
   FoxISAPI.ini
   VFP6Run.exe

5. Run the OLEISAPI application through Internet Explorer. Here is a sample line
   to execute this through FoxISAPI from the server computer:

      http://LOCALHOST/SCRIPTS/FOXISAPI.DLL/MYTEST.MYCLASS.MYPROC

6. Click the Refresh button a couple of times.

Please note the existence of several .ini files in the INetPub\Scripts\ directory
that were not there previously.
