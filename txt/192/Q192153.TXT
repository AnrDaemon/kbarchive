TITLE   :DOC: CompactDatabase IntelliSense Different than Documentation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The IntelliSense parameters for the DAO 3.5 CompactDatabase method are different
than the parameters specified in the documentation that appears in the Help
files and Visual Basic Books Online.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The correct IntelliSense parameters that actually show up are:

      CompactDatabase (SrcName, DstName, [dstLocale], [Options], [SrcLocale])

There is no mention here that there is a parameter for a password. Visual Basic
Help and Visual Basic Books Online specify that the CompactDatabase method is as
follows:

      CompactDatabase (olddb, newdb, locale, options, password)

The documentation talks about the password as a parameter, but it does not talk
about the SrcLocale, which is a parameter in the IntelliSense display.

The actual functionality when using CompactDatabase Method accepts a database
password in the same position as the SrcLocale parameter displayed by
IntelliSense. See the REFERENCES section of this article for more information on
the syntax used in code to pass a password through to a database that is
protected. It is also important to note that the Jet35upd.exe is available as an
upgrade designed to fix problems with the CompactDatabase method in Jet 3.5.
