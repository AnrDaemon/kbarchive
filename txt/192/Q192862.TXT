TITLE   :BUG: Incorrect Return of SubSelect in SELECT-SQL Statement
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A SQL Select using the Not In clause with a subquery might incorrectly return no
records.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a user defined function in the subselect similar to the example below:

       SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id NOT IN ;
          (SELECT order_id FROM orditems WHERE MyFunction(order_id))

       FUNCTION MyFunction
          LPARAM lx
          RETURN .F.
       ENDFUNC

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following cases, the main query could return an incorrect number of
records:

      SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id NOT IN ;
         (SELECT order_id FROM orditems WHERE 1=2)

   -or-

      SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id NOT IN ;
         (SELECT order_id FROM orditems WHERE .F.)

The above queries return 0 records rather than all records in the table.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open the TestData Sample Database.

2. Run one of the SQL Select statements listed in the MORE INFORMATION section
   of this article.

3. Notice that the Select returns no rows.
