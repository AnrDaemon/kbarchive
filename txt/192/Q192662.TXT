-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0, you may receive the following error message
when you take Remote Control of clients running Windows 95 OEM Service Release
2.5 (OSR 2.5):

   WUSER32.EXE caused an invalid page fault in module COEXIST.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the computer is using Primax mouse drivers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can disable the mouse drivers from the
Autoexec.bat file. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. On the Start menu, click Run and type "Sysedit". Click OK.

2. On the Window menu, click Autoexec.bat. Locate the following entry:

      c:\drivers\pmouse\pmouse.com

3. Change this entry to read:

      REM c:\drivers\pmouse\pmouse.com

The next time Windows 95 restarts, the standard default mouse driver will be
loaded. If you want to enable the Primax mouse driver again, repeat this
process, but remove "REM" from the line in Step 3.
