TITLE   :BUG: Exclusive Check Box Unselected After Importing/Exporting
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After importing or exporting a file in Visual FoxPro using the interface, any
tables that are opened through the Data Session window afterward will be opened
as shared because the Exclusive check box has been reset and cleared. This
happens even though Exclusive is still set to On as the default setting in the
FoxPro environment. If the files are imported or exported programmatically, the
exclusive status is not changed in the Data Session.

RESOLUTION
==========

After the Open button of the Data Session is selected, select the Exclusive
check box to open the files exclusively.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Issue a SET EXCLUSIVE ON in the Command window to ensure exclusive status in
   the FoxPro environment.

2. From the Window menu, choose Data Session to open the Data Session window.

3. Click the Open button and make sure that the Exclusive check box is selected.

4. From the Visual FoxPro File menu, choose Export. In the Export dialog box,
   type "myfile" (without the quotation marks) in the "To:" text box.

5. Select the ellipsis box located to the right of the "From:" text box and
   choose any FoxPro table.

6. Select the OK button. The table exports and you are returned to the Data
   Session window.

7. Select the Open button on the Data Session window and observe that the
   Exclusive check box is cleared.
