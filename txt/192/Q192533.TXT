SYMPTOMS

If an application posts a message to the user's outbox during the time the
application is synchronizing the user's outbox, the MAPI spooler sends a
non-delivery report (NDR) on this newly submitted message with the following
error message:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject: Extended MAPI message 11001.

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
