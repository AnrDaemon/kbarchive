PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The documentation for the Microsoft Script Control 1.0 states that the Script
Control supports an Immediate Window and a Macro Run Dialog box. However, you
cannot open an Immediate Window or a Macro Run Dialog box for the Script
Control. Further, there is no documentation on how to open an Immediate Window
or a Macro Run Dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

These features are supported but not currently implemented. Therefore, you
cannot open an Immediate Window or a Run Macro dialog box for the Script
Control.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
