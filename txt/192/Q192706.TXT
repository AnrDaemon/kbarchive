PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, version Service Release 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2) improves the way Word handles
dates. Specifically, SR-2 makes it easier to do the following in Word:

 - Work with dates that use single digits (for example 1/1/0)

 - Sort dates that use 00 for the year

 - Use dates in a document saved in RTF format

MORE INFORMATION
================

Working with Dates That Use Single Digits
-----------------------------------------

If you set the Regional Settings in Control Panel to a non-US date format, such
as Year/Month/Day, Microsoft Word 97 SR-2 will now correctly parse single digit
years around the year 2000.


Sorting Dates That Use 00 for the Year
--------------------------------------

If you set the Regional Settings in Control Panel to a non-US date format, such
as Year/Month/Day, Microsoft Word 97 SR-2 will now correctly parse dates that
have a zero for the month or day. Pre-SR-2 versions of Microsoft Word would give
erroneous results in this situation.


Using Dates in a Document Saved in RTF Format
---------------------------------------------

If you set the Regional Settings in Control Panel to a short date format, such as
mm/dd/yy, and then save a document containing a 2-digit date value, such as
"11/15/01," as Rich text Format (RTF), Microsoft Word 97 SR-2 will write out
custom date properties as 4 digits (instead of two) in the RTF file. Pre-SR-2
versions of Microsoft Word would write custom date properties out in RTF as
"11/15/01." SR-2 correctly writes it out as "11/15/2001."

When Is Date Parsing Used?
--------------------------

Microsoft Word parses dates whenever it performs operations on dates. Examples
include:

 - Sorting dates in a table.

 - Applying a date formatting picture switch to merge fields, quote fields, or
   input to a form field.

 - Linking bookmarked text to a date type custom property.

 - String to date operations in WordBasic.
