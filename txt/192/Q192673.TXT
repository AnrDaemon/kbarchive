The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 contains an updated Ntfs.sys file that allows you
to access NTFS-formatted partitions that are created in Windows 2000. Although
you can read and write to these volumes, you may not have access to all files
and utilities that are present in Windows 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NTFS in Windows 2000 requires some on-disk changes that enable support for
additional features. Some files that are saved under Windows 2000 may not be
available for use on Windows NT 4.0-based computers. Listed below are some of
the limitations you may encounter with Windows NT 4.0 when you try to access
NTFS volumes created with Windows 2000:

 - Chkdsk.exe - This is not available for NTFS volumes. When you try to run
   Chkdsk on a volume, you see this message:

   This version of Chkdsk cannot be run on a volume created by later versions of
   Windows NT.

If the volume is in use, Chkdsk allows itself to be scheduled, but displays the
same message on the startup screen.

 - Any disk utilities, such as Defrag, should not be used on these volumes.

Additional query words: NTFS.sys NTFS40.sys Dual boot
