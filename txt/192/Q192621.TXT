SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the CUSTOMWZ sample distributed with Visual C++ contains
the following inaccurate statement:

   CUSTOMWZ is an example of a custom AppWizard, which contains features that
   the standard AppWizard does not provide.

Rather than being merely an example, CUSTOMWZ is the actual source code for the
Custom AppWizard project wizard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Building the CUSTOMWZ sample creates an AppWizard functionally identical to the
Custom AppWizard project wizard. This wizard appears in the New dialog box's
Projects tab after clicking New on the File menu. The CUSTOMWZ sample from the
Visual C++ 5 documentation samples contains a bug which will overwrite the
standard Custom AppWizard code. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
