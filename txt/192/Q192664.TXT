SUMMARY

Some administrators want the Package Command Manager (PCM) Welcome screen to not
be displayed to their client computers immediately upon installation. This
article documents the steps involved in how to accomplish this:

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent the PCM Welcome screen from being displayed to the client computers,
perform the following steps:

1. Create a blank Sms.ini file.

2. Add a [Local] section.

3. Add the line "ShowPCMIntroDialog=False" (without the quotation marks) to the
   Local section.

4. Use a logon script or another method to distribute the Sms.ini template file
   you created to the clients.

The Welcome screen will still be displayed the first time Package Command Manager
is called, but it will not be displayed immediately after installation.
