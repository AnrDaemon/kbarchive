TITLE   :XFOR: MSMI: Messages with Incomplete X.400 Addresses are NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent from a foreign system to an MS Mail user via the MS Mail Connector
of an Exchange Server computer are not valid address types for reply when they
are received at the MS Mail postoffice. Foreign address types are any address
type that the MS Mail postoffice does not have a gateway or access component
installed for routing.

CAUSE
=====

When the MS Mail Connector receives a message with a foreign address type, it
will convert the address to an X.400 address with DDA (domain defined attribute)
type and DDA value. The problem is that the X.400 address does not include the
GDI (Global Domain Identifier) from the Exchange Server computer. When a client
replies to the address, the MS Mail Connector will generate an non-delivery
report back to the client as a non-routable address.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS

version 5.5.
