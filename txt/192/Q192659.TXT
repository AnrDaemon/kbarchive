-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Outlook 98 from an installation point created with
the Microsoft Outlook Deployment Wizard (ODW), the menu items listed under the
Microsoft on the Web Help menu may be disabled.

CAUSE
=====

The following line in Outlk98.adm, which is included with the Microsoft Outlook
98 Deployment Kit (ODK), is missing an ending quote:

      OLDefSupport="Online &Support,,outlook,,,8.0,support

This syntax error causes the following invalid entry to be added to the registry
of a client workstation:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Outlook\WebHelp

   Value Name: Command4
   Value Data: Online &Support

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, perform the following steps from the computer on which
the ODK is installed:

1. Locate Outlk98.adm in the \Program Files\ODK\Policies directory.

2. Make a backup copy of the file.

3. Open the file using Notepad or another text editor and add a double quotation
   mark (as shown below) to the end of the following line:

         OLDefSupport="Online &Support,,outlook,,,8.0,support"

4. Save the file and quit.

Any new Outlook installation points created with the ODW will have the correct
string added to the registry. Existing Outlook 98 installation points must be
rebuilt in order for this change to take effect.

To correct this problem on a client workstation, edit the registry using the
following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start the Registry Editor.

2. Select the following registry key:

      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Outlook\WebHelp

3. Select the Command4 value and enter the following string in the Value data
   field:

      Online &Support,,outlook,,,8.0,support

4. Quit the Registry Editor.

5. Restart the Outlook 98 client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
