SYMPTOMS
========

When one or more new radio button controls are placed on a dialog box, they do
not appear in the Control ID's list box on the ClassWizard Member Variables tab.
This gives the user the impression that a member variable cannot be associated
with the control.

RESOLUTION
==========

A workaround to this problem is to add the Group property to the first radio
button created by using the following steps:

1. In the Dialog Editor, right-click a radio button, and then click Properties.

2. From the General tab of the Radio Button Properties dialog box, select the
   Group check box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
