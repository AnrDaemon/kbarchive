TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Connector Does Not Parse Attachment Name Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a cc:Mail user changes the date separator from a forward slash ( / ) to a
dash ( - ) in the Control Panel Regional Setting Date on the cc:Mail client
computer, the cc:Mail Connector does not parse the attachment sent by this user
correctly. The attachment has the date appended to the file name in the Exchange
Server recipient's inbox. For example, if the cc:Mail client sends a message
with attachment named Att.txt, the attachment will appear as Att.txt 9-11-1998
in the Exchange Server recipient's inbox.

RESOLUTION
==========
