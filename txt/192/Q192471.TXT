TITLE   :DOCERR: SMS Resource Guide Lists Wrong Option for PREINST
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdocerr smsdocerr

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Page 3 of the "Microsoft Systems Management Server Resource Guide" states that
the PREINST command requires braces {} around the sitecode in the /DEINSTALL and
/UPGRADE switches. This is incorrect. The correct syntax for the options is

      /DEINSTALL:sitecode
      /UPGRADE:sitecode

without braces around sitecode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only switch for PREINST that requires braces is the /DELSITE switch to
indicate which site to delete from the database. For example:

      PREINST /DELSITE:{sitecode,parentsite}

Additional query words: prodsms hman hierarchy manager mgr
