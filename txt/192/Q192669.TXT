TITLE   :Pagefile Set Incorrectly on Computers with >2049 MB RAM
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the "Write debugging information to" check box in the ControlPanel/System/
Startup/Shutdown tab is selected on a computer that has more than 2,049 MB of
RAM, and the pagefile is currently set to fewer than 2,049 MB, a dialog box will
appear indicating that the page file is going to be set to 2,049 MB. This is an
incorrect pagefile size. The page file should be set to the amount of RAM + 3
MB, which is the actual amount of pagefile needed for the system to save a
memory.dmp in the event of a kernel mode stop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
