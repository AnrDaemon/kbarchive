-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5 Build 2.573.2927 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to create a Data Source Name (DSN) for the Alpha version of the
Microsoft Oracle ODBC Driver (v2.573.2927) for use with the Oracle8 client
components, you receive the following error:

   The Oracle(tm) client and networking components were not found. These
   components are supplied by Oracle Corporation and are part of the Oracle
   Version 7.3 (or greater) client software installation.

   You will be unable to use this driver until these components have been
   installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Alpha version of the Microsoft Oracle ODBC Driver is looking for specific
Oracle 7.3 dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) which are not part of the Oracle8
client component install.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is corrected in MS Oracle ODBC Driver for Alpha found in MDAC 2.1.
(not SP2).

STATUS
======

Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.1 contains an updated Alpha Microsoft
Oracle ODBC Driver that is compatible with the Oracle8 client components.
