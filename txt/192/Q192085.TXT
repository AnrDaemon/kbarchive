SYMPTOMS
========

When you send or receive a message through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS,

message is sent or received between the years 2000 and 2009, the two- digit year
recorded in the Sent.log or Recv.log file is 10. For example, if the message is
sent on January 1, 2000, the date recorded is 1/1/10.

CAUSE
=====

The Inpost.exe and Outpost.exe components do not properly record the sent and
received dates in the Sent.log and Recv.log files for the years 2000 through
2009.
