SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Microsoft Visual Basic Application Setup
Wizard to install the design-time license information for a custom ActiveX
control developed in Visual Basic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order for the Setup Wizard to install the license information a .VBL file
must be created. This is accomplished by specifying that the control require
license information. The following steps will demonstrate how to create a new
control and require a license file for the control.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start Microsoft Visual Basic and create a new ActiveX Control project.
   UserControl1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click Project1 Properties, and then click the General
   Tab.

3. Select "Require License Key" and click Ok.

   At this point, the custom ActiveX control will require a license to be used in
   the design environment. When the control is compiled, a .VBL file will be
   created that contains the necessary license information. If using the Setup
   Wizard to generate an application distribution set, the Setup wizard will
   include the license information in the [Licenses] section of the Setup.lst
   file.
