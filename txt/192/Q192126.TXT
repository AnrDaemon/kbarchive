TITLE   :Add Workstation Fails with RestrictAnonymous
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An error occurs when the Remoteboot service attempts to update the Access
Control List (ACL) on new workstations in the Rpl files\Workstations folder. The
service appears to be attempting an anonymous user connection to the PDC
(Primary Domain Controller) to enumerate the SID (Security Identifier) for the
Remote Boot workstation account to apply to the directory and fails because of
the Restrict Anonymous setting. The following error message appears:

   The following error occurred updating the file permissions for
   workstation <xxxx>.
   Windows NT error 0xc0000022

CAUSE
=====

The machine account is created correctly using a valid account but, while
accessing the ACL, it uses a null user name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
