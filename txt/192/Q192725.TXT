SYMPTOMS

When you forward a message in Outlook Web Access (OWA) that contains a large
amount of text, the vertical scroll bars may disappear in the new message. This
behavior occurs only when using Internet Explorer 3.0 for the Macintosh or
Internet Explorer 4.x for Windows 3.x. These symptoms do not occur with Internet
Explorer for 32-bit platforms.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only way to get to the text is to scroll with the arrow keys or to use the
mouse to highlight and drag to the bottom on the message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
