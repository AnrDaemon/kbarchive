TITLE   :XADM: Full Fidelity Not Maintained on Opaque-Signed Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an opaque-signed message through a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer, the full fidelity of the message may not be maintained.

Specifically, the loss of fidelity may include some missing Request For Comments
(RFC) 822 specification headers, such as Disposition-Notification- To. This can
be particularly relevant when using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI, or
"e-commerce") applications, where the combination of opaque-signed messages and
Disposition-Notification headers is relatively common.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) command
"FETCH RFC822.SIZE" is called.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
