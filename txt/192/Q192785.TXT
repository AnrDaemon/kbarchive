TITLE   :Must Be Administrator to Eject Removable Media
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to eject the media in a removable media drive by using the Eject
option on the context menu of Windows NT Explorer, the following error occurs:

   An error was encountered trying to unmount Removable disk [D:] Check to make
   sure there are no open files or windows from that volume.

In addition to the conditions mentioned in the error message, this error will
occur if the user does not have Administrator privileges on the local computer.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

The user must be given Administrative privileges, to use the Eject functionality
of Windows NT Explorer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Iomega Zip drive is an example of a device that will demonstrate this
behavior. Other comparable devices are thought to function similarly.

The media can be ejected manually through the release button, but the Eject
option on the shortcut menu that appears when you right-click Windows NT
Explorer will not work if the user does not have Administrative privileges.
