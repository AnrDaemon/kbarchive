TITLE   :FIX: Table Allows Modification Although DBC is Opened NOUPDATE
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you open a database in Visual FoxPro with the NOUPDATE option of the OPEN
DATABASE command, and then you modify the structure of a table contained in that
database, you can save changes to the table structure. This can cause the
database to become invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the versions of Visual FoxPro previous to 6.0, do not modify a table
structure if the OPEN DATABASE command uses the NOUPDATE argument.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

         CLEAR
         CLOSE DATABASE ALL
         SET SAFETY OFF
         CREATE DATABASE 'TESTDB.DBC'
         CREATE TABLE 'TESTTAB.DBF' NAME 'TESTTAB' (CFIELD C(3) NOT NULL)
         CLOSE DATABASE ALL
         OPEN DATABASE testdb NOUPDATE
         USE testtab EXCLUSIVE
         MODIFY STRUCTURE
         VALIDATE DATABASE

2. When the Table Designer displays, create an index on the Cfield field and
   then click the OK button.

3. Click Yes in the confirmation dialog to make the changes permanent.

4. Click OK in the "Cannot update cursor" error dialog box.

NOTE: The VALIDATE DATABASE command yields an error that the newly created index
is missing from the database container.
