SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the DHTML Page Designer to create a simple
HTML form application. Currently, the DHTML Page Designer will not insert all
the tags required to do this so you need to manually insert the missing tags.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can build a simple HTML form using the DHTML Page Designer. The form will
have two fields and a submit button. The information will be posted to an ASP
file on the server. The server will simply display the values entered in the
fields. Follow these steps:

1. Start Visual Basic 6.0 and create a new DHTML Application project.

2. Open the DHTMLPage1 from Designers.

3. From the toolbox, drag a textbox and change its NAME to Field1.

4. Drag another textbox and change its NAME to Field2.

5. Drag a submit button and change its VALUE to Submit.

6. Save the project.

7. You now need to save the HTM as an External HTML file. To do this:

   a. Bring up the DHTML Page Designer Properties.

   b. Select "Save the HTML as an External file" check box.

   c. Click the "New" button.

   d. Specify the location and name of the file you want.

8. Click the Launch Editor button on the Designer tool bar. You will see HTML
   similar to the following in your editor:

         <BODY>
         <INPUT id=TextField1 name=TextField1>
         <P>
         <INPUT id=TextField2 name=TextField2>
         <P>
         <INPUT id=SubmitButton1 name=Submit1 type=submit value=Submit></P>
         </BODY></HTML>

   Notice that there are some tags missing. First the HTML tag is missing.
   Secondly, there is no FORM tag. Edit the file manually to enter these tags so
   that the final HTM looks like the following:

         <HTML>
         <BODY>
         <P<
         <FORM ID=Form1 NAME=Form1 METHOD=POST
               ACTION="http://MyServer/MyDir/Test1.ASP">
         <INPUT id=TextField1 name=TextField1>
         <P>
         <INPUT id=TextField2 name=TextField2>
         <P>
         <INPUT id=SubmitButton1 name=Submit1 type=submit value=Submit></P>
         </FORM>
         </BODY>
         </HTML>

9. Save the file from the HTML editor and, when prompted by the designer, say
   Yes to reloading the file into the designer

10. At this point, you can add some validation code. This can be done by writing
   the onSubmit event handler for the form as follows:

         Private Function Form1_onsubmit() As Boolean

             Dim Valid As Boolean

             Valid = True
             If TextField1.Value = "" Then
                 BaseWindow.alert "You must enter a value for Field1"
                 Valid = False
             End If
             If TextField2.Value = "" Then
                 BaseWindow.alert "You must enter a value for Field2"
                 Valid = False
             End If

             Form1_onsubmit = Valid

         End Function

11. Save the Visual Basic 6.0 project.

12. Now create the Test1.asp file you used in the ACTION attribute in your FORM
   tag. This file must be stored on your IIS web server. If you are not using
   IIS, you will not be able to use ASP. Use NotePad to save the following as
   test1.asp on your server:

         <%@ LANGUAGE="VBSCRIPT" %>

         You entered the following values from your DHTML Page Designer
         form:<p>
         TextField1 = <%=Request.Form("TextField1") %><br>
         TextField2 = <%=Request.Form("TextField2") %><br>

13. Run the project. You should see the values you enter into Field1 and Field2
   returned to you by the server.
