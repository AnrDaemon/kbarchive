======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view My Computer or Windows Explorer, two CD-ROM drives may be
displayed even though you have only one CD-ROM drive in your computer. When you
try to access either CD-ROM drive, your computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you have both the real-mode CD-ROM device drivers and
the Windows 95/98 CD-ROM device drivers installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the System Configuration Editor (Sysedit.exe) to
disable the real-mode CD-ROM device drivers. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the Windows menu, click Autoexec.bat, locate the line that loads the
   real-mode CD-ROM device drivers, and then type "rem" (without the quotation
   marks) followed by a space at the beginning of the line. For example, the
   line in your Autoexec.bat file may be similar to the following line:

   C:\Windows\Command\Mscdex.exe /d:mscd001

3. On the Windows menu, click Config.sys, locate the line that loads the
   real-mode CD-ROM device drivers, and then type "rem" (without the quotation
   marks) followed by a space at the beginning of the line. For example, the
   line in your Config.sys file may be similar to the following line:

   Device=C:\Cdrom\Cdrom.sys /d:mscd001

4. On the File menu, click Exit.

5. Click Yes when you are prompted to save the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat
   files.

6. Restart your computer.
