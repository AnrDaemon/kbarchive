SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to browse to http://localhost, Microsoft Internet Explorer may
prompt you to "Work Offline" or "Try Again." If you click Work Offline, you may
receive an "Web page unavailable offline" message, and if you click Try Again,
you may receive a "Page cannot be displayed" message.

CAUSE

Internet Explorer searches for an Internet connection before it attempts to
serve local Web pages. This behavior is by design.
