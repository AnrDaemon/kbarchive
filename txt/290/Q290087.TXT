KEYWORDS:_IK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 for NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Management Console administration snap-ins for the Microsoft
Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
services that are included with Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0
allow administration from Microsoft Windows NT Server computers only. With the
extensions that are included in the IIS Resource Kit, you can administer these
services from a remote Windows NT Workstation computer as well.

NOTE: Microsoft Product Support Services does not support Resource Kit utilities.

MORE INFORMATION

To install these components on a Windows NT Workstation computer, follow these
steps:

1. Ensure that the Windows NT Workstation computer is running Windows NT
   Workstation 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or later.

2. Ensure that Internet Explorer 4.01 or later is installed.

3. Run Setup for IIS 4.0. For the installation type, select Custom.

4. On the Start menu, point to Settings, point to Control Panel, and click
   Add/Remove Programs. Select Personal Web Server and click Show Subcomponents.

5. Click Internet Service Manager.

6. Complete the IIS 4.0 installation.

7. Run Setup from one of the following locations:

    - The IIS Resource Kit\Utility\SMTP-NNTP Admin\NNTP folder

    - The IIS Resource Kit\Utility\SMTP-NNTP Admin\SMTP folder of the IIS
      Resource Kit CD

    - The \IIS Resource Kit folder of the computer on which you have installed
      the IIS Resource Kit

8. For the installation type, select Typical.

9. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). To do this, on the Start menu,
   point to Programs, and then click Microsoft Management Console.

   administration snap-ins.
