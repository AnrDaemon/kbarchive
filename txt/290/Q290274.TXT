TITLE   :SMS: Window Drag Operation Slow After You Enable Acceleration
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbClient kbConfig kbRemote kbsms200 kbHelpDesk kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server 2.0 includes functionality that you can use to enable
remote control acceleration for video drivers that are not listed on the default
list of drivers that are known to accelerate. When you enable acceleration for a
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 computer that uses a S3Trio3d video driver, when you
drag or move a window on the desktop, the action may be very slow. If you remove
the Idisntkm value from the registry for that video driver, you can drag the
window at the usual speed; however, acceleration is lost.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you are using an S3 video driver version 3.26.35 or
3.26.36.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, obtain the latest video driver for the S3Trio3d video
card. If you experience this issue if you are using a different video card,
contact the manufacturer of the hardware or video card to obtain the latest
driver. If you still experience this issue after you install the updated driver,
you may need to remove this video driver from the list of drivers in the SMS
Administrator console.
