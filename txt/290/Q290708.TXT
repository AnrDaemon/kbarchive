The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows taskbar has the Always on Top and AutoHide properties set on. When a
Visual FoxPro top-level form is maximized and the BorderSyle property has any
value other than 3-Sizable, the Windows taskbar may not appear when the mouse
moves over the edge of the form.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the BorderStyle property to 3-Sizable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On Windows 2000 and Windows Me, set the Windows taskbar properties to Always
   on Top and Auto Hide.

2. Place the following code in a program and then run it:

   PUBLIC Y
   Y=CREATEOBJECT("formtest")
   Y.SHOW
   RETURN
   DEFINE CLASS formtest AS FORM
   	CAPTION = "Form1"
   	SHOWWINDOW = 2
   	BORDERSTYLE = 0
   ** A BorderStyle of 1 or 2 also fails.
   ** Change BorderStyle to 3 and it works.
           MAXBUTTON = .F.
           CLOSABLE = .F.
           WINDOWSTATE = 2
   	VISIBLE=.T.
   	HEIGHT=200
   	WIDTH=375
   	ADD OBJECT extbtn AS COMMANDBUTTON WITH ;
   		HEIGHT = 24, ;
   		LEFT = 72, ;
   		TOP = 48, ;
   		WIDTH = 108, ;
   		CAPTION = "Exit"
   	VISIBLE=.T.

   	PROCEDURE extbtn.CLICK
   	THISFORM.RELEASE
   ENDPROC
   ENDDEFINE

3. After the form appears, move the mouse over the bottom edge of the form. Note
   that the taskbar does not appear.

4. Open the program and change the BorderStyle property of the form to either 1
   or 2. Run the code and perform step 3 again. Again, the taskbar does not
   appear.

5. Open the program and change the BorderStyle property of the form to 3. Run
   the code and perform step 3 again. The taskbar now appears.
