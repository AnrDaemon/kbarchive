======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An error message occurs when you try to apply Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3
(SP3) after you receive the following message:

   Setup will reinstall Microsoft Exchange Server files for your current Setup
   Configuration. Existing databases will be preserved, but the Microsoft
   Exchange services will be stopped during the reinstall.

The error message is:

   The System cannot find the file specified:
   Microsoft Windows NT
   ID no: 0xc0020002

When you check the Exchange Server Setup.log file, you may notice that only one
line is logged in the file:

   ++++ Microsoft Exchange Setup initialized ++++

No information indicates which file cannot be found.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you removed the Key Management Service (KMS) component
incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the KMS component and apply it again. If you
cannot remove the KMS component when you run Setup.exe, you must remove it
manually:

1. Stop KMS.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. Remove the following registry keys:

    - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeKMS

    - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\KMServer

    - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup\Key Management Server
