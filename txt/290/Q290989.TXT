KEYWORDS:kbfile exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to gain access to a Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) Web
page, you may receive an error message that is similar to:

   You are not authorized to view this page.

   You might not have permission to view this directory or page using the
   credentials you supplied.

   If you believe you should be able to view this directory or page, please try
   to contact the Web site by using any e-mail address or phone number that may
   be listed on the <server_name> home page.

   HTTP Error 403 - Forbidden
   Internet Explorer

This error message may occur even though the permissions are set correctly. For
additional information about how to set permissions correctly, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q175892 XWEB: Permissions Required for Outlook Web Access

The permissions are set to "Execute (including script)" on the Exchange Server
virtual directory.

CAUSE
=====

Although the error message indicates that there is an incorrect default Web
site, this issue occurs because the Internet Server Application Programming
Interface (ISAPI) filter for Exchfilt.dll either is not loaded or is not working
properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, replace the existing Exchfilt.dll file in the
<drive>:\Exchsrvr\Server\Setup\I386 folder with the Exchfilt.dll file from
either the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM or the Winnt\System32 folder. If you are
running Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS) version 4.5, you can obtain the
Exchfilt.dll file from either CD-ROM 3 of the SBS 4.5 CD-ROMs or the
Winnt.sbs\System32 folder.
