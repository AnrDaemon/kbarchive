======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart the computer or the IISAdmin service, the following event
appears in the event log:

   Event Type: Error
   Event Source: Active Server Pages
   Event Category: None
   Event ID: 5
   Description:
   Error: Error while reading default settings. please do regsvr32 asp.dll..

CAUSE
=====

This event is logged because the installed version of the Asp.dll file is
searching for a metabase key that does not exist. However, the metabase key does
not need to exist because Asp.dll uses a default value. Asp.dll logs this event
log entry to recommend that you reregister Asp.dll as an overly precautious
troubleshooting step.

RESOLUTION
==========

This event log entry is completely harmless and can be ignored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 2.
