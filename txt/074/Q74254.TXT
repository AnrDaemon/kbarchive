SUMMARY
=======

According to Symantec technical support, the Norton Cache (NCACHE.EXE) that
comes with Norton Utilities version 6.0 is compatible with most versions of DOS,
including IBM PC-DOS, Microsoft MS-DOS versions 3.0 through 5.0, and Digital
Research DR-DOS 5.0. Symantec also claims compatibility with Windows 3.0 and
Desqview versions 2.25 and later. Norton Cache must NOT be installed in a
virtual machine, and it also cannot be loaded from within Windows 3.0.

To use Norton Cache with IntelliWrites enabled (under Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced
mode), the following line may need to be added to the [386enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:

      VirtualHDIRQ=false

This will ensure that Norton Cache will perform as expected when writing data to
disk.

The following is an example of the syntax used in enabling IntelliWrites:

      Device=c:\norton\ncache.exe /ext=384 c:/+I

In this example, 384K of extended memory will be used and IntelliWrites has been
enabled from drive C. There are other ways to enable Intelliwrites; for more
information, see "The Norton Utilities User's Guide" for version 6.0.

we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
