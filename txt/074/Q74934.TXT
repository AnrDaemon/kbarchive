SUMMARY
=======

According to Dell Technical Support, Dell 486 machines have been tested (by
Dell) with Microsoft Windows 3.0. If Windows does not install or run properly on
a Dell 486 computer, the hardware cache and BIOS shadowing should be turned off
through the CMOS setup. To access the CMOS setup, press CTRL+ALT+ENTER at the
MS-DOS prompt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On 486 E, TE, DE, and SE models, the CMOS settings to disable are FAST VIDEO and
486 CACHE. On 433P models, the settings to disable are FAST SYSTEM and FAST
VIDEO.

Dell 486 systems shipped with MS-DOS 3.3 or 4.01 may also include PC-KWIK
software for disk caching. If PC-KWIK is being used, it should be disabled.

Dell Technical Support reports that Dell systems shipped with MS-DOS 4.01 or
later do not have FASTOPEN.EXE or APPEND.EXE loading in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or
CONFIG.SYS files. If these files are being loaded, they should be commented out,
but not deleted.
