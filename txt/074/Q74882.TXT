SUMMARY
=======

The assembly language multiplication instruction MUL accepts only one operand.
The second operand is implied to be either the AX or the AL register depending
on whether an 8-bit multiplication or 16-bit multiplication is being performed.

If a second operand is specified, the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version
6.0 will generate the following error:

   error A2008: syntax error : ,

MASM versions 5.1 and 5.1a generate the following warning:

   warning A4001: Extra characters on line

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code below can be used to illustrate this situation. Assembling the
code with MASM version 5.1, 5.1a, or 6.0 will result in one of the above
errors.
