-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Before installing the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) on a
machine, Microsoft Windows must be installed in a local configuration. The
Windows SDK installation program is not compatible with a networked
configuration for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The design of the Windows SDK installation program assumes that a number of
Windows files are available in particular subdirectories of the main Windows
directory. These assumptions are valid only when a local copy of Windows is
installed on a given machine. Neither the network server nor the network client
installation of Windows uses the required directory structure. Attempting to
install the Windows SDK on either network Windows installation yields the
following message:

   Unable to find Windows in the specified directory.

The Windows SDK includes a copy of the debugging version of Windows, which the
installation program copies along with the other tools. Because the debugging
version of Windows provides additional parameter validation and error checking,
it is very useful to help find problems during application development. The
Windows SDK includes a batch file to switch between the retail and debugging
versions of Windows. Switching between Windows versions in a networked
environment would be very difficult and could cause unexpected results.
Therefore, installing the Windows SDK with a network version of Windows is not
allowed.

For more information on a network installation for Windows, see the "Getting
Started with Microsoft Windows" manual. For more information on the debugging
version of Windows and tips to create better applications, see Chapter 3 of the
"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Getting Started" manual.
