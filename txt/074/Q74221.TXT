TITLE   :FIX: COMM Directive Produces Error If Count Field Not Specified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 will produce a syntax error
when multiple variables (separated by commas) are listed following a COMM
directive if any variable, except the last one in the list, does not have a
count field specified. For example, assembling sample code #1 with MASM 6.0
produces the following error:

   error A2008: syntax error: dec

When assembling sample code #2, MASM 6.0 produces this error:

   error A2008: syntax error: inc

RESOLUTION
==========

The following methods may be used to work around these problems:

1. Place the count field with each variable specified. For example:

         COMM NEAR var1:word:1,var2:word:1,var3:word:3

-or-

2. Make multiple COMM statements. For example:

         COMM NEAR var1:word
         COMM NEAR var2:word

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code below illustrates this problem. MASM version 5.1 and 5.1a
assemble the code without any errors. According to the BNF Grammar in Appendix B
of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide," this should also assemble
correctly with MASM version 6.0.

Sample Code #1
--------------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   .MODEL small
   .DATA
     COMM NEAR var1:WORD,   var2:WORD    ; This doesn't work
   ; COMM NEAR var1:WORD:1, var2:WORD    ; This works
   END

Sample Code #2
--------------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   .MODEL small
   .DATA
     COMM NEAR var1:WORD,
               var2:WORD, var3:WORD      ; This doesn't work

   ; COMM NEAR var1:WORD:1,
   ;           var2:WORD:1, var3:WORD:1  ; This works
   END
