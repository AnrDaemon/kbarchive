SUMMARY
=======

If a Ballpoint mouse, connected to a PS/2 port, works correctly in real and
standard modes but its pointer freezes in 386 enhanced mode, do the following:

1. Check the disks that accompanied the Ballpoint mouse for the BPVKD.386 file.

2. Copy the file into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

3. Modify the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file as follows:

      Change                              To
      ------                              --

      [386enh]                            [386enh]
      keyboard=vkd.386                    keyboard=bpvkd.386

4. Save the file.

5. Exit Windows and restart.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BPVKD.386 replaces the default virtual keyboard driver (VKD.386) for a ballpoint
mouse plugged into a PS/2 port. It is used to put the mouse driver into
ballpoint mode. Without it, the ballpoint input is treated as a normal mouse
(non-ballpoint) signal.
