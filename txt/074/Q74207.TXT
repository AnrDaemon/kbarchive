SUMMARY
=======

Under low memory situations, the MS-DOS 5.0 Backup program will report the
following error message:

   Could Not Allocate Segment

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error message is most likely to occur when you are shelled out of an
application. There are only two options if you are shelled out of an application
and cannot use Backup because there is not enough memory. Either more memory
must be freed up before the application is started, or memory usage by the
program must be reduced before you shell out to DOS.

To free up more memory before starting an application, reduce the number of
device drivers and memory resident utilities loaded in the CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you have an 386 computer, you can use EMM386.EXE to load
these items into upper memory.

Consult your application documentation or contact your vendor to determine how to
free up more memory in an application before shelling out to an MS-DOS prompt.

For more information on loading device drivers and memory resident programs into
upper memory, consult chapter 12, "Optimizing Your System," of the "Microsoft
MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference," or query on the following words:

   MSDOS and DEVICEHIGH and EMM386.EXE and LOADHIGH
