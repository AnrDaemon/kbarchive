-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running RBase version 3.1 from Microsoft Windows version 3.0 enhanced mode with
EMM386.EXE loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file using the NOEMS switch may produce a
"Fatal Error..." message.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the program information file (PIF) used to run RBase 3.1
contains any non-zero value in the EMS KB Limit field of the Advanced PIF
properties dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set both the EMS KB Required and KB Limit fields to 0 (zero) to allow RBase 3.1
to function properly.

Setting both EMS fields to 0 forces RBase 3.1 to make use of XMS extended memory
instead of EMS memory.

Rbase is manufactured by Microrim, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
