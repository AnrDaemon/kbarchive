The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

CTRL+SPACEBAR allows you to alternatively select and deselect a file in MS-DOS
version 5.0 Shell.

This keystroke is particularly useful when the Select Across Directories option
is selected from the Options menu. By pressing CTRL+SPACEBAR, you can deselect a
file after switching to a directory in the directory tree.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When selecting a new directory from the directory tree, if you decide to scan
through the list of files with the keyboard, a file is selected. This is due to
the normal operation of MS-DOS Shell. If Select Across Directories is activated
and you perform a file operation, all files that have been marked during any
such perusal will be acted upon.

To avoid this problem, after scanning through a list of files, be sure to press
CTRL+SPACEBAR to deselect any files you do not want to act upon.
