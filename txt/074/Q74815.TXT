======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The screen display on your AT&T 6300 doesn't write to or clear the screen
correctly. Common problems include the following:

 - Failure to write to the screen correctly (using DIR, and so forth).

 - Failure to clear the screen correctly (using CLS).

 - MS-DOS Shell fails to display or displays incorrectly.

Both text-based screen writes and clear screen commands affect only the top half
(1/2) of the screen. Most applications work correctly, but from the MS-DOS
command prompt or inside MS-DOS Shell, the screen may not update correctly.

CAUSE
=====

AT&T has confirmed that these problems occur under ROM BIOS versions earlier
than 1.43.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to AT&T, if the ROM BIOS version is earlier than version 1.43,
then you should upgrade to ROM BIOS version 1.43 to solve these problems.

Customers can order the BIOS update though AT&T's National Parts Hotline at
(800) 222-7278 ([800] 222-PART). The 1.43 ROM BIOS part number is 105-203-780.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
