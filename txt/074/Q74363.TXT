TITLE   :PRB: Fatal Exit 0x00FF or 0xD000: MakeProcInstance Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application running under the Microsoft Windows graphical environment
receives FatalExit error 0x00FF or 0xD000, "MakeProcInstance only for Current
Instance."

CAUSE
=====

A function in a dynamic-link library (DLL) calls the MakeProcInstance() function
using an application's instance handle. The FatalExit() occurs because the
current value of the DS register does not match the instance handle passed to
MakeProcInstance().

RESOLUTION
==========

A DLL should not call MakeProcInstance() on behalf of the calling application.
The MakeProcInstance() function is not designed to be used this way.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an application is executing, the value of the DS register is equal to the
application's data segment, which is identified by the application's instance
handle.
