The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

According to Tandon Technical Support, Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade cannot be
installed on Tandon Pac 286 computers. The Setup program can be used on these
computers to create a working set of MS-DOS disks, but the upgrade cannot be
installed on the Pac 286's removable hard drives.

Tandon is aware of this problem, and is planning on releasing its own version of
MS-DOS that can be installed on these machines.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Tandon Pac 286 computer has two removable hard drives. The MS-DOS 5.0 Setup
program does not recognize these removable hard drives and currently cannot be
made to install to them. These hard drives are also not recognized if the
machine is booted from an MS-DOS 5.0 boot disk, preventing a manual
installation.
