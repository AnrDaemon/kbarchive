SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, a private profile or
initialization file, as the name suggests, is designed to be used when a program
initializes and terminates. A profile stores a limited amount of information
from one program session to the next. A profile is are not designed to serve as
a database.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows assumes that an INI file is not larger than 64K; file access is not
guaranteed beyond that point. Even if a text editor is used to extend the file,
Windows does not search for information past the 64K boundary.

Also, Windows performs a linear search of INI files; therefore, the longer the
file becomes, the longer it takes to access an item at the end of the file. Each
time an application accesses an INI file, Windows opens and closes the file
which incurs additional overhead.

One alternative to using initialization files to store large amounts of
information is for the program to write to and maintain its own files. This
approach is faster, more flexible, and more reliable than using profile for
purposes for which it is not designed.
