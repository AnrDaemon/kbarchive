The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Windows 3.0, when you change the program icon for an MS-DOS
based application by choosing Properties from the File menu and
choosing the Change Icon button, the icon change is only active while
the icon is displayed in its program group. Once the application is
started and then minimized on the desktop, the original icon contained
in PROGMAN.EXE is used.

NOTE: This behavior does not affect Windows applications.

The opposite problem occurs under Windows 3.1. If you change a Windows
application's icon, it reverts to its original icon when minimized. An
MS-DOS application, however retains its new icon both on the desktop
and when running minimized. For example, under Windows 3.1, if you
change the icon for Notepad, run it, then minimize it, it reverts back
to the original Notepad icon despite the fact that you changed it and
it appears changed in the Accessories group. If you change the icon
for the MS-DOS prompt, it retains this new icon both in the Main Group
(not running) and when it is minimized on the desktop (running).
