SYMPTOMS

If MS-DOS Shell is running and Logimenu or Click are accessed, the following
error message is displayed:

   Mouse driver not found

This message is displayed even though the mouse driver is loaded.

CAUSE
=====

According to Logitech, the problem is due to how the Logitech mouse driver
version 5.01 is loaded under MS-DOS 5.0 or later. When the MS-DOS Shell is
loaded, the driver cannot locate itself.

RESOLUTION
