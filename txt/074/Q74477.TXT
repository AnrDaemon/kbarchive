SUMMARY
=======

The VPROD.386 device driver displays the message "Profiler VM terminated
abnormally" whenever the virtual machine (VM) being profiled is terminated
(crashed) while profiling is still under way. Some circumstances under which
virtual machines are terminated are: when a bad instruction is executed, when an
attempt is made to program virtualized hardware in a manner incompatible with
the virtualizing virtual device (VxD), or when the user selects "Terminate" in
the Settings dialog box. In any of these situations, the VPROD device driver
cannot flush its queued profile data and clean up after itself.

The message is displayed when VPROD can no longer simulate MS-DOS calls into the
terminated VM. The message warns that it is highly likely that profiling data
has been lost.

For more information on the Profiler, see chapter 13 of the "Microsoft Software
Development Kit Tools" manual.
