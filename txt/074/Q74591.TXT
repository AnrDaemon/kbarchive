-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a File Manager, searching for a file
will find hidden files in addition to unhidden files, regardless of the File
Manager settings. This also occurs in Windows version 3.1, although file icons
indicate that they are read only. Files are not indicated as hidden.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view hidden files within individual directories, from the File Manager View
menu, choose Include and select Show Hidden/System Files.

Whether this setting is chosen or not, choosing Search from the File Manager File
menu, selecting Search, and then typing the hidden filename will return the
hidden file.

Example
-------

1. Choose Search from the File Manager File menu (without selecting Show
   Hidden/System Files).

2. Search for "*.SYS" (without the quotation marks).

At a portion of the search, the hidden system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS will be
found within the root directory of drive C.

Additional query words: 3.0 3.00 3.0a 3.00a 3.1 3.10 3.11
