The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS 5.0 "User's Guide and Reference" and MS-DOS 6.0 "User's Guide" do not
show a second parameter for the FCBS command. The online Help for MS-DOS 6.0 and
6.2 also does not show this parameter.

In previous versions of MS-DOS, the second FCBS parameter set the number of files
opened by FCBs (file control blocks) that MS-DOS cannot close automatically.
This parameter is no longer necessary with MS-DOS 5.x and later due to the
nature of the new FCB scheme.

When MS-DOS 5.x and later versions parse the CONFIG.SYS file, it disregards a
second parameter if present on the FCBS line. This feature allows old style FCBS
commands to be processed without error under MS-DOS 5.x and 6.x.

Additional query words: 6.22 5.00 5.00a 6.00 6.20
