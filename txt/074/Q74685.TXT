The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using MS-DOS version 5.0 Shell to load any Rbase (Rbase for DOS, Rbase Runtime,
and Rbase Compiler) version 2.11 causes problems with the display in Rbase. This
is due to a conflict in the methods Shell and Rbase 2.11 use to access the mouse
interrupts.

Rbase technical support recommends not using MS-DOS Shell and Rbase 2.11
together. However, this problem does not occur when using Rbase 3.1b.

The product included here, Rbase, is manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
