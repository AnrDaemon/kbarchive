The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Although you can install Microsoft's Works for MS-DOS version 2.0a as a complete
"text" application, it does not run reliably in a window in Windows enhanced
mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is true whether you try to start in a window (by designating this in the
PIF) or switch into a window (by pressing ALT+ENTER). Works will switch into a
window, but will not run correctly in a window and will produce the following
error message:

   You cannot run this application while other high resolution applications are
   running full screen. The application will be suspended until a low-resolution
   or text application is running full screen. Check the PIF settings to ensure
   they are correct.

The above message may be displayed either upon switching into a window, starting
the application in a window, or when existing Works.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run Microsoft Works in full-screen mode (do not run it in a window).
