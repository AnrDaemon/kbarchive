SUMMARY
=======

To allow PC-Kwik Print Spooler version 3.0 to operate properly with Microsoft
Windows, Multisoft Corporation recommends that you follow these steps:

1. Disable the Print Manager. This is not required but sometimes it improves
   performance. If you want the Print Spooler to only spool data from
   non-Windows applications, leave the Print Manager enabled. By default,
   Windows only lets the Print Spooler spool data from non-Windows applications.

2. If you want to spool data from Windows applications, change port connection
   to LPTx.OS2, where x specifies the port being used.

If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you should try the following
steps:

1. Set the following statements in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

         Com1AutoAssign=0 (If Com1 exits)
         Com2AutoAssign=0 (If Com2 exits)
         LPT1AutoAssign=0

2. From the Control Panel, select the 386 Icon.

3. Select Never Warn for device contention. Turning off the conflict messages
   means that Windows cannot warn you if more than one program is trying to use
   the same port at the same time. Make sure that the first application has
   completed sending data to the spooler before sending data from the second
   application.
