SUMMARY
=======

If you have Select Across Directories selected under Options, and you use MS-DOS
Shell to copy, move, or delete a file, more than one file may be copied, moved,
or deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have Select Across Directories enabled, each time the directory is
changed and another file is highlighted, the previous file retains its
highlighted or selected status. Therefore, when you issue the COPY, all files
that have been highlighted are copied. The MOVE command functions in the same
way.

The DELETE command also functions in much the same way; however, you are prompted
before each file is deleted.

The CHANGE ATTRIBUTE command prompts you to choose between changing attributes
for the last file highlighted or all highlighted files.

The RENAME command prompts you for a new filename for each highlighted file.

Select Across Directories does not support selecting files across disks.

To avoid the above problem, disable the Select Across Directories option, then
choose Deselect All from the File menu.
