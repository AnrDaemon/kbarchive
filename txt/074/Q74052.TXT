SUMMARY
=======

The Sharp PC6200 series of notebook computers has a hardware setup program whose
options must be changed if Windows Setup stops responding (hangs) when you
insert Disk 2.

For example, if VGA was chosen during the hardware selection portion of the
Windows Setup program, and the Sharp's LCD monitor is incorrectly set to emulate
MDA rather than VGA, Setup may hang when you insert Disk 2. Changing the Sharp's
LCD monitor emulation to VGA should permit the Windows Setup program to run
without incident.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the hardware options, press CTRL+ALT+SETUP twice at the MS-DOS prompt.
Note: SETUP is a key on the upper right-hand side of the keyboard on a PC6220
notebook computer.

The first time you press CTRL+ALT+SETUP, a menu will appear that allows you to
change the date, time, and so on. The second time you press CTRL+ALT+SETUP, you
will activate a menu that allows for other changes, such as LCD monitor
emulation and memory (expanded/extended) configuration.
