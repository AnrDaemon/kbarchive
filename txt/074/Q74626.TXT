-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 or later RAMDRIVE.SYS on an Acer 1100 computer
and HIMEM.SYS is loaded with the /machine:6 switch, any attempt to access the
RAM drive displays a message that the drive is write protected. This message
occurs when you try to copy a file to the RAM drive or when you try to get a
directory listing of the RAM drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the /machine:6 switch from the HIMEM.SYS
line in your CONFIG.SYS file. After removing the switch, you can access the RAM
drive normally.
