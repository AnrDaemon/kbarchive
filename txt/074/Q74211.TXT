COMPAQ DOS 4.01 contains a file called CACHE.EXE, which is similar to MS-DOS 5.0
SMARTDRV.SYS. It is incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0 unless you use the SETVER
command to set the version to 4.01 or earlier.

MORE INFORMATION

To use CACHE.EXE, add the following statements to the CONFIG.SYS file:

      device=c:\dos\setver.exe
      device=c:\cache.exe

To set the version, do the following:

1. Type "SETVER CACHE.EXE 4.01" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

2. Reboot your computer.
