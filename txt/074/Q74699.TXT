TITLE   :PRB: "Export Not Defined" Linker Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The linker reports an "export not defined" error even though all the functions
listed in the EXPORTS section of the definitions (DEF) file are defined.

CAUSE
=====

One of the exported functions uses the C calling convention (cdecl).

RESOLUTION
==========

In the C calling convention, the case of function names is preserved, and the
name of each function is preceded by an underscore. This convention must also be
used in the DEF file. For example, the function declaration

      int FAR Function()

is exported as:

      _Function

Additional query words: 3.00 no32bit 3.10
