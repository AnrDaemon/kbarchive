-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When adding an application to the version table using the SETVER command, only
the application filename should be used (without the full path). In addition,
the application filename should include the extension. The proper syntax to use
when adding an application to the version table using SETVER is

   setver [drive:path] [filename n.nn]

where

   [drive:path] specifies the location of the SETVER.EXE file

   [filename is the name of application to be added, plus the extension

   n.nn] is the version of MS-DOS reported to the program

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that [drive:path] refers to the location of the SETVER.EXE file, not the
location of the application to be added, and therefore, it is not necessary to
include.

Two possible error messages can occur if the full pathname of the application is
used when attempting to add to the version table:

   ERROR: Could not find the file SETVER.EXE

   Use "SETVER /?" for help.

   ERROR: Missing Parameter

   Use "SETVER /?" for help.

In each of the above cases, the application will not be added to the version
table.


Additional query words: 6.22 5.00 5.00a 6.00 6.20
