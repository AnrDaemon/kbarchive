SUMMARY
=======

The Plus Hardcard II may be extremely slow when used with EMM386. The following
information, which applies to Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0, could help correct
this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the use of EMM386.EXE:

1. Exclude the Hardcard XL BIOS address. For example:

         Device=c:\dos\EMM386.EXE X=C000-C800

   (These specific numbers are only examples for the purpose of syntax. The exact
   addresses to exclude will depend on your configuration. Please see your
   Hardcard documentation.)

2. If you are not using UMBs, use the frame= parameter to set the address of the
   page frame such that the page frame will not conflict with the addresses
   being used by the Hardcard. For example, if the Hardcard is using addresses
   C000-C800, you might use:

         Device=c:\dos\EMM386.EXE frame=D000

   This sets the page frame for the D000-DFFF range of memory.
