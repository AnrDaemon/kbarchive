======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the ANSI.SYS device driver to disable the CTRL+C key combination.
This is done by assigning the CTRL+C key combination to NULL.

NOTE: ANSI.SYS must be loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file to enable ANSI escape
sequences.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable the CTRL+C key combination, create a file using the following steps:

1. Run MS-DOS Editor.

2. Type the following on the same line with no spaces between:

   " CTRL+P 027 " (without the quotation marks)

   To type this line, hold down the CTRL and P keys simultaneously and then
   release them. Then hold down the ALT key while you press the 0, 2, and 7 keys
   on the numeric keypad.

   These key combinations produce the left arrow that symbolizes the start of the
   ANSI escape sequence.

3. On the same line, leaving no spaces, type:

   " [3;0;p " (without the quotation marks)

4. Save this file as a batch file (for example, FILE.BAT).

5. Exit MS-DOS Editor.

Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt to disable CTRL+C:

   " type file.bat " (without the quotation marks)

To enable the CTRL+C key combination, replace step 3 above with the following

   " [3;3p " (without the quotation marks)

and save the file under a different name.

By adding the TYPE command and the name of the file to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you
can disable or enable the CTRL+C key combination when the machine starts up.
