ADMENUAPP adds two menu items to the system menu of each application running
under Windows. To do this, it uses two system-wide hooks: a WH_GETMESSAGE hook
and a WH_CALLWNDPROC hook. Both of these hooks are implemented in ADMENULIB, a
fixed-code DLL.

Whenever the WH_CALLWNDPROC hook function sees a WM_INITMENU message being sent
to a top-level window, it appends the two new menu items to that window's system
menu. The items are removed when the menu is closed.

The two menu items that are added appear as "New Menu Item 1" and "New Menu Item
2." If the user selects one of these items, the WH_GETMESSAGE hook procedure
sees the resulting WM_COMMAND message and responds by posting a private message
to ADMENUAPP. ADMENUAPP handles the private message by displaying a dialog box
stating that one of the two added items was selected.
