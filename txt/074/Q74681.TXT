TITLE   :Printer CPI Files Do Not Support CP 852
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following message when you attempt to prepare codepage 852
for the printer:

   Device or codepage missing from font file.

CAUSE
=====

MS-DOS version 5.0 introduced support for codepage 852. The codepage information
(.CPI) files for the display device (EGA.CPI and LCD.CPI) were updated to
support this codepage. The codepage information files for the printers
(4201.CPI, 4208.CPI, and 5202.CPI) were not updated to support this codepage.
Therefore, you receive the error message when you attempt to prepare the
codepage for the printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a limitation of MS-DOS version 5.0. This
feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future release
of MS-DOS.
