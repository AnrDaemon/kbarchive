SUMMARY
=======

When you install Berkeley Systems After Dark, several files are installed in
various places on the hard disk drive and Microsoft Windows files are modified.
If you need or want to remove these files, several steps must be taken.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways to remove After Dark files.

Option 1: Temporary, for Troubleshooting Windows
------------------------------------------------

1. After Dark adds AD-DOS.COM to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. AD-DOS.COM must be
   disabled using the REM command. (It is a terminate-and-stay-resident [TSR]
   program.)

   NOTE: AD-DOS.COM is optional and is not always installed.

2. Place a semicolon (;) in front of the "L" of

   Load= line

   in the WIN.INI file. This disables the Load= line so that After Dark cannot
   automatically load.

3. The SYSTEM.INI file must also be edited. In the [386Enh] section, place a
   semicolon (;) in front of the

   device=ad.386

   line. This disables the After Dark device driver.

Option 2: Permanent, Total Removal of Files
-------------------------------------------

1. Delete the After Dark directory (default is C:\AFTERDRK) and all its files.

2. Delete the following files in the Windows directory:

   GRAFSTAT.TXT, ADMODULES.ADS, MESSAGES.ADS, RANDOM.ADS, AD_PREFS.INI,
   AD-DOS.COM

3. The backup files for AUTOEXEC.BAT, SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI are named
   AUTOEXEC.ADK, SYSTEM.ADK, and WIN.ADK. These backup files are placed in the
   Windows directory. You should rename these files to the correct extensions.
   For example, rename AUTOEXEC.ADK to AUTOEXEC.BAT.
