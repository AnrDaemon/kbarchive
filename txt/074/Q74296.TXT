SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS EDIT command does not save a backup file the way the MS-DOS EDLIN
command does.

Information about EDIT applies to Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0.

Information about EDLIN applies to Microsoft MS-DOS versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.21,
3.22, 3.3, 3.30a, 4.0, 4.01, and 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

EDIT is an external DOS command that can start the MS-DOS Editor (a full-screen
text editor), but EDIT does not create a backup file with a .BAK extension the
way EDLIN does, even if changes are made.

EDLIN is an external DOS command as well. However, EDLIN is a line- oriented text
editor; when you end your editing session with the "E" command, EDLIN will give
the changed file the same name as the original and rename the original file with
a .BAK extension. If you end the editing session with the "Q" command, however,
your original file will remain unchanged.
