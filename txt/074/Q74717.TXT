The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are two major causes of System Integrity Violations:

 - There is a hardware conflict.

   -or-

 - An MS-DOS application running under Windows is trying to access memory that
   it does not have access to in Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the System Integrity Violation error message occurs when you run a non-
Windows application from Windows in enhanced mode, follow these steps:

1. Use a AUTOEXEC.BAT file that looks like:

         Path C:\Windows;C:\;C:\DOS
         Prompt $p$g
         Set Temp=C:\Windows\Temp

   This example assumes that Windows is in C:\WINDOWS and that MS-DOS is in
   C:\DOS.

2. Use a CONFIG.SYS file that looks like:

         Files=60
         Buffers=10
         Shell=c:\Command.com /p /e:2048
         Device=c:\Himem.Sys

   This example assumes HIMEM.SYS is in the root directory of drive C.

3. Make sure the MS-DOS application is being called from a program information
   file (PIF).

4. Check to see if a System Integrity Violation still occurs. If it does,
   continue with step 5. Otherwise, the application's problem was cleared up in
   either the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, or the PIF.

5. Try running Windows in standard mode.

6. If the program runs under Windows in standard mode, add these two lines to
   the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI and then try running Windows in enhanced
   mode:

         EmmExclude=A000-C7FF
         EmmExclude=E000-EFFF (for some programs E000-FFFF)

7. If step 5 does not work and your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files read as
   above, the application may be incompatible with Windows or you have a
   hardware conflict of some type.
