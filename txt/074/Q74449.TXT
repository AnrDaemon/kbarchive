The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS Shell allows you to create program items and groups with password
protection. The password can be entered either through Shell when the
program/group item is created, or manually by adding the appropriate lines under
the [programstarter] section in the DOSSHELL.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adding a program/group item through Shell with a password containing lowercase
letters results in the rewritten DOSSHELL.INI file to remap the lowercase
letters of the password to uppercase, six alphabetic characters away from the
original letter. For example, if you enter the password

   abcd

it will be written to the DOSSHELL.INI password section as

   password = GHIJ

Thus, a = G

   b = H
   c = I
   d = J
   e = K
   f = L
   g = M, and so on.

If you manually edit the DOSSHELL.INI file and enter a password with any
lowercase letters, the program/group item will not be accessible when prompted
for the password, even if you type it exactly as it was entered. If you manually
edit DOSSHELL.INI and change the password to all capital letters, the password
will not be encrypted.

Example
-------

1. In the MS-DOS Shell main window, highlight Command Prompt.

2. From the File menu, choose Properties. In the Password text box, enter "abcd"
   (without the quotation marks). To run the command prompt from now on, you
   must enter the password abcd.

3. Open DOSSHELL.INI in MS-DOS Editor.

4. Note that the password for Command Prompt is encrypted as GHIJ.

5. Change the password to ZZZZ and save the file.

The password to start the command prompt is now ZZZZ.
