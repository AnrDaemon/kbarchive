KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing MS-DOS or later on a BSR computer, you may be unable to start
MS-DOS from the hard drive, Uninstall disk, or a MS-DOS 5.0 or later bootable
floppy.

CAUSE
=====

The BIOS chips in some BSR 386 machines prevent MS-DOS from properly completing
its starting sequence.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are having difficulty starting MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2 on a BSR machine,
turn off switch 2 on switch bank 1 of the system. If the machine still does not
start, contact BSR for a BIOS upgrade.

NOTE: Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager (QEMM) does not work on the machine
after this switch has been changed.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to uninstall MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2, you must start from a floppy
disk from your previous version of MS-DOS, back up the hard drive to floppy
disks, and manually install the previous version of MS-DOS to the hard drive. To
reinstall your previous version of MS-DOS, do the following:

1. Use the Sys command to transfer the previous version of DOS system files to
   the hard drive.

2. Copy the COMMAND.COM file to the root directory of drive C.

3. Copy the contents of the previous version of MS-DOS disks to the DOS
   directory.

4. Find the old AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files on the Uninstall disk as
   AUTOEXEC.DAT and CONFIG.DAT. Copy them to the hard drive, and rename them
   AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS.
