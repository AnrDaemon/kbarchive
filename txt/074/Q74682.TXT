SUMMARY
=======

When task swapping within MS-DOS version 5.0 and later Shell, dynamically
created temporary files cannot be stored on a floppy drive. Even if the
temporary environment variable is pointing to a floppy drive, Shell overrides
the variable and creates any temporary files on the hard drive.

If executing commands from the command prompt, such as the TYPE and PIPE
commands, MS-DOS will store temporary files on the floppy disk.

MS-DOS Shell recognizes a RAM drive for storing temporary files during task
swapping.
