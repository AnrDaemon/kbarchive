SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS Editor should not be used to edit nontext files. If it is used to
edit a file that is not a text file, it will display any embedded text in the
file, but will most likely corrupt the file when you save it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the MS-DOS Editor is used to edit a file, it will only display the ASCII
portion of the file, and will strip out all other characters. Consequently, all
nondisplayable characters are lost when you save the file. No error messages or
warnings are issued when this occurs.

Problems typically occur if you attempt to edit document files created by word
processing programs. The MS-DOS Editor may appear to edit these files properly,
but will usually corrupt them when you save them, due to the loss of control
information needed by the word processing program.
