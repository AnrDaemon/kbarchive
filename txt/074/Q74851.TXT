-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.0's EMM386.SYS always defaults to OFF mode, whereas
MS-DOS version 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2's EMM386.EXE defaults to ON mode. If you want to
compare the behavior of these two versions, either specify ON in the EMM386.SYS
command line or specify OFF in the EMM386.EXE command line. The command line
arguments ON and OFF activate and suspend the operation of the EMM386.EXE device
driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Certain non-VCPI aware applications may fail when attempting to enter protected
mode with EMM386 enabled. These programs cannot sense that EMM386 has already
placed the CPU in protected mode and, thus, cause an "EMM386 Privileged
operation error" when they attempt to switch into protected mode.

Applications that function properly with EMM386.SYS but encounter problems with
EMM386.EXE may function properly if EMM386.EXE is loaded with the mode specified
as OFF.
