SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a compressed Windows-based application without any other
applications running, you receive one of the following error messages:

   Insufficient Memory to Run Application; Close one or more Applications to
   Increase Available Memory and try again.

   -or-

   This Application has Violated System Integrity and will be terminated. Close
   all applications, exit Windows, and reboot your computer.

The first error may occur when there is ample memory available and other
applications run without error. The screen may blink once before returning the
error message.

An MS-DOS icon generally appears at the bottom of the screen, indicating that an
MS-DOS-based application has been minimized.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the application's .EXE file is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, expand a new copy of the .EXE file from your original
Windows or Windows for Workgroups disks.
