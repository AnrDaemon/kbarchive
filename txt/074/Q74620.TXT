The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When FILE:= is below the tenth line in the [ports] section, the print command
issued within an application prints directly to a file called FILE in the
application's directory.

FILE:= will be below the tenth line in the [Ports] section of the WIN.INI file,
when the following conditions are true:

 - You select a default printer connected to FILE in the Control Panel.

 - Each time the print option is selected in a Windows application, a dialog box
   reports "Sending to Printer."

 - You are not prompted for the name of the output file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To check the [Ports] section of the WIN.INI file, follow these steps:

1. Open the WIN.INI file.

2. Scroll to the [Ports] section.

3. Check to see which line contains FILE:=.

Repositioning FILE:= above the eleventh line, saving the WIN.INI file, exiting
Windows, and restarting Windows allows you to successfully print to a user-named
file. (When printing from within a Windows application, you are prompted for the
filename).
