SUMMARY
=======

Disney Software Support does not recommend running Mickey's ABCs with Microsoft
Windows version 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to run Mickey's ABCs under Windows 3.0, you may experience
problems related to the sound source, such as garbled sound, and the program may
stop responding (hang). The sound source is an external device that plugs into
the printer port.

Page 23 of the "Mickey's ABCs: A Day at the Fair Instruction Guide" refers
readers to the "Microsoft Window's User's Guide" for instructions about sound
distortion when using Windows. There is no information on this problem contained
in the Windows guide.

Disney is researching the problems associated with Mickey's ABCs and Windows 3.0.
Further questions should be directed to Disney Software customer service.
