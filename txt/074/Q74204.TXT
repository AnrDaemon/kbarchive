TITLE   :MS-DOS CHKDSK Does Not Show Disk Label As a Hidden File

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The CHKDSK command in MS-DOS version 5.0 or later no longer shows the disk label
as a hidden file, as was the case with previous versions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When comparing the MS-DOS 5 or later Upgrade disks with an earlier version of
CHKDSK, a hidden file should appear in the earlier version's output. This does
not indicate a problem with the disk.

In versions of MS-DOS prior to 5.0, the disk label was shown as a hidden file
under CHKDSK. When using CHKDSK from DOS 4.01 or earlier to view the first DOS 5
Upgrade disk, you will get the following output:

Volume DISK      1 created 04-09-1991 5:00a
Volume Serial Number is 1966-0205

    362496 bytes total disk space
         0 bytes in 1 hidden file
    353280 bytes in 11 user files
      9216 bytes available on disk

      1024 bytes in each allocation unit
       354 total allocation units on disk
         9 available allocation units on disk

    651264 total bytes memory
    443248 bytes free

Using CHKDSK from MS-DOS 5.0 on the same Upgrade disk will produce the following
output:

Volume DISK      1 created 04-09-1991 5:00a
Volume Serial Number is 1966-0205

    362496 bytes total disk space
    353280 bytes in 11 user files
      9216 bytes available on disk

      1024 bytes in each allocation unit
       354 total allocation units on disk
         9 available allocation units on disk

    651264 total bytes memory
    443248 bytes free

If the label on a disk is removed, the hidden file will disappear. (This is not
recommended for Upgrade disks.)
