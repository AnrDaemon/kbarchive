SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting a Microsoft application running on a network, the following
steps will help simplify the troubleshooting process:

Questions to ask:

1. Does the problem occur on all workstations or to all users?

    - If the answer is yes, and there is no record of the error message in the
      knowledge base, try to find some factors (hardware, software, and so on)
      that are common to all of the machines or all of the users.

    - If the answer is no, and there is no record of the error message in the
      knowledge base, try to find common factors relative to those machines
      affected (similar software, hardware, and so on).

2. Does the problem occur when logged in as Supervisor?

    - If the answer is yes, it is probably not a rights-related issue.

    - If the answer is no, it is probably an issue related to the rights of the
      individual receiving the error message.

3. If the problem still is not solved, disable all non-network related programs
   from the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and login scripts (if applicable). If the
   problem still occurs, it is not related to software conflict.

Specific steps to follow if the network is Novell:

1. If the application is Microsoft Word and the network is Novell, check to see
   if Word was started with the /N switch and if the MSWNET, for Word versions
   earlier than 5.50, or MSWNET55, for Word version 5.50, variable is set
   correctly.

    - If the MSWNET was not set or set correctly, set the MSWNET (MSWNET55)
      variable through the login script or in the manner described in the
      "Setting Up Network Workstations for Multiple Users" application note.

2. Is the problem printing related?

    - Type in CAPTURE SH at the DOS prompt. This command provides information on
      how Novell is capturing the data to the LPT port.

      If the TABS field displays NO CONVERSION, the job configuration is set to
      BYTESTREAM (appropriate for applications with a print driver). If the TABS
      field displays anything other than NO CONVERSION, it is set to TEXT
      (appropriate for applications without a print driver). See the PRINTCON
      menu and CAPTURE command line utilities in the "Introduction to Novell"
      section of the Novell documentation.

      If printing a large document or a document with numerous downloaded fonts
      or graphics, increase the time-out count for the job.

      If printing to a postscript printer, do not use a banner page.

    - If printing problems still occur, follow the steps listed in "What to Do
      If a Network Printer Won't Print."
