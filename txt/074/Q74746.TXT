TITLE   :FIX: ORG Following ORG Statement with $ May Fail in 6.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 may generate an incorrect
offset when using the ORG directive following a previous ORG statement that uses
the current-address operator ($). For example, incorrect code will be generated
if the statement "ORG $+1" is placed anywhere before another ORG statement.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code below demonstrates this problem. You can see in the source
listing that the label "wrongoffset" has an incorrect offset. Instead of having
an offset of 200h, wrongoffset is placed at offset 304h, which is 104h plus the
200h specified in the last ORG statement. Rather than assigning the location to
200h, the assembler added 200h to the current location.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   _text SEGMENT
   one   BYTE ?
         ORG 100h
   two   BYTE ?
         ORG $+2
   three BYTE ?
         ORG 200h
   wrongoffset LABEL word
   _text ENDS
   END

   0304               _text ENDS
                  END
