TITLE   :HDRSTORE May Restore Previous DOS Files into the DOS Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you receive an "Incorrect DOS version" error message while attempting to
invoke a DOS command after using HDRSTORE, it is likely that files from the
previous DOS version have been added to the DOS directory. If this has occurred,
it is recommended that you rerun the MS-DOS 5.0 Setup program and reinstall
MS-DOS 5.0 to the hard disk drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS 5.0 HDRSTORE.EXE command restores files (with the exception of
IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM) and directories from the backup disks
created with the HDBKUP.EXE command. If a previous version of DOS was present on
the hard disk when HDBKUP was run, these files will be restored into the DOS
directory regardless of what DOS 5.0 files currently reside within that
directory.

If you want to use HDBKUP.EXE to back up the hard disk while a previous version
of DOS resides in the DOS directory, it is recommended that you first restore
the hard disk with HDRSTORE.EXE, then run the Setup program.
