-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you load NET$OS.EXE you may receive the following error message:

   Insufficient memory

NOTE: The NET$OS.EXE file is an alternative to IPX.COM.

CAUSE
=====

The NET$OS.EXE file provides its own memory manager. When HIMEM.SYS is loaded
with no switches, the above error message is returned.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two solutions:

 - Use the INT15 switch on HIMEM.SYS (Located in the CONFIG.SYS file) to allow
   NET$OS.EXE to access the memory on its own. Use at least 1088 on the INT15
   switch. For example:

      DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS /INT15=1088

 - Take the HIMEM.SYS driver out of the CONFIG.SYS file.
