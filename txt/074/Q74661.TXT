SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS 5.x and later Setup runs from only drive A or B. If you have an external
floppy drive that is not recognized as drive A or B, you need to either
reconfigure you hardware or run MS-DOS Setup from your hard drive.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To run MS-DOS Setup from the hard drive:

1. Create a directory on the hard drive. For example, type "md c:\temp" (without
   the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

2. Copy all of the files from the MS-DOS Upgrade disks to the temporary
   directory. For example, insert the first disk into floppy drive A and type
   the following at the command prompt:

   " xcopy a:*.* c:\temp " (without the quotation marks)

   Repeat this for all disks included in the MS-DOS Upgrade package.

3. Change to the directory that you created in step 1. For example, at the
   MS-DOS command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each
   one.

   " c:
   cd\
   cd temp " (without the quotation marks)

4. At the command prompt, type the following:

   " setup " (without the quotation marks)

   This command starts the MS-DOS Setup program.

5. After Setup has completed and rebooted your computer, delete the temporary
   directory and the files.
