======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Willow VGA-TV video card does not display Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 Setup
or hard drive backup programs properly when in NTSC (National Television
Standard for Communications) mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Willow VGA-TV card has an RCA jack that sends an NTSC signal to a television
or video recorder. When it is in NTSC mode and the MS-DOS 5 Setup program is
run, only the top half of the screen is displayed. VGA mode displays properly on
the PC's monitor, but no output is sent to the TV or video recorder.

There are two methods for switching from NTSC to VGA mode:

1. Run VGA.COM that Willow provides on a utility disk.

2. Connect jumper J11 on the card so that the card boots in VGA mode.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;

or reliability.
