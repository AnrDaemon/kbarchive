-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system

SUMMARY
=======

If a directory is created when shelled out of Microsoft MS-DOS Shell, SHELL will
only recognize the new directory by performing a full scan. This can be done
with the F5 key, or through the View pull-down menu by choosing Refresh.

CTRL+F5 is listed in the online help as:

   CTRL+F5     Update the file list for the current directory

This will not cause a new directory to appear in the tree.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can be reproduced by doing the following;

1. Start the SHELL.

2. Press SHIFT+F9 to start a DOS prompt.

3. Type "MD TEST" (without the quotation marks) at the DOS prompt.

4. Type "EXIT" (without the quotation marks) to return to the SHELL.

5. Press CTRL+F5. No change in the directory tree will occur.

6. Press F5. SHELL will re-scan the hard drive, and the new directory will
   appear.
