-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is no built-in setting within Microsoft Write to set the default font and
point size, or to set the default margins. However, it is possible to create a
blank file with the font and point sizes and margins in it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are the steps to set up Write with a default font and point size
and default margins. If you have different printers connected that have
different font capabilities, you may want to have multiple Write icons, each
starting with a font that is compatible with the desired printer.

NOTE: The listed fonts within Write are not necessarily compatible with all
printers. Write will update its configuration (within WIN.INI) with fonts that
are addressable through the printer's driver. These fonts are not changed when
using a different printer. Therefore, printing to a different printer with a
font that is not built into that printer results in the printer using its
default font.

Step to Set Up Default Font Only (Windows 3.0 or 3.0a)
------------------------------------------------------

Edit the [MSWrite] section in the WIN.INI file to default to the desired font
with the Font1 entry. For example:

      [MSWrite]
      Font1=Script,48,255
      Font2=Courier,48,0
      Font3=LinePrinter,48,0

Steps to Set Up the Default Font and Point Size for Write
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Run Write.

2. From the Document menu, choose Page Layout.

3. Select the margins desired.

4. From the Character menu, choose Fonts.

5. Select the font and point size desired.

6. Type a few spaces for the changes to take effect.

7. Save the file as a filename such as WRITEFON.WRI, and exit Write.

8. Highlight the Write icon in Program Manager.

9. From the File menu, choose Properties.

10. Change the command line from

   WRITE.EXE

   to:

   WRITE.EXE WRITEFON.WRI

   and choose OK.

Every time you select the Write icon, it loads WRITEFON.WRI, which contains the
font and point size and margin settings. If you are creating multiple Write
icons for multiple printers, you need to have a unique filename for each one.
For example WRITEFON1.WRI for printer 1 and WRITEFON2.WRI for printer 2. To
ensure that the file is not accidentally overwritten, start Windows File Manager
and change the file attributes to "read only". When you try to save a document
write will inform you that the file is read only and prompt you to save the file
under a different name.
