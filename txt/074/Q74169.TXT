TITLE   :PRB: L4001 Warning May Be Caused by Using Incorrect Linker
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::6.0,6.0a,6.0b,6.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2 
 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the process of linking an application, Microsoft LINK generates the
following message:

   warning L4001: frame-relative fix-up,

   frame ignored near xxx in segment yyy

In most cases, LINK ignores the initial frame and performs a far address
calculation.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur incorrectly when the incorrect linker is used. For example,
the error occurs if an assembly module is assembled with USE32 segments in
Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) and LINK version 5.x attempts to create the
.EXE file. The same error occurs if MASM version 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b, or 6.1 creates
code for the FLAT memory model.

RESOLUTION
==========

The resolution depends on the target operating system. When Windows NT is the
target, use the CVTOMF utility provided with the Windows NT Software Development
Kit (SDK) to convert the generated object file from OMF format to COFF format.
Then use the LINK utility provided with the Windows NT SDK to build the
application. If OS/2 version 2.0 is the target, use LINK386 from the IBM OS/2
2.0 development kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code sample demonstrates both the error message discussed above
and the methods to avoid it. Assemble the code below with MASM version 6.0,
6.0a, 6.0b, or 6.1. To reproduce the error message above, link with a
segmented-executable linker, such as LINK version 5.x. To create a correct
executable file, link the code with LINK386 from IBM.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: /c
   ;     Link options needed: Link with LINK 5.x to see errors
   ;                          Link with LINK386 for correct results
