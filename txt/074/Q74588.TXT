The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a

SUMMARY
=======

The DOSSHELL.VID file gives Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0 Shell the ability to
display in graphics mode. Graphics mode is supported by most monitors, including
(but not limited to) EGA and VGA displays in color and on CGA displays in black
and white.

Most CGA displays require the DOSSHELL.VID file to prevent "snow" from appearing
on the screen, regardless of the Shell mode.

The DOSSHELL.VID file is not required to run Shell in text mode. To run Shell in
text mode, use the /T switch. For example:

dosshell /t

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade disks are several files with the file extension of
.vi_ one of which can be expanded by doing the following:

1. Insert the last disk from the MS-DOS 5 Upgrade into drive A, and copy
   EXPAND.EXE into the DOS directory on the hard drive by typing the following:

   " copy a: expand.exe c:\dos" (without the quotation marks)

2. Locate the appropriate file on the MS-DOS 5 Upgrade disks. For example, if
   the display is EGA, locate the file called EGA.VI_. The file locations are as
   follows:

   Disk Size    Video Driver File Location
   ---------    --------------------------

   5.25-inch    Disk 3
   3.5-inch     Disk 2

3. Type one of the following (the most appropriate for your display) with the
   appropriate disk in drive A:

   " expand a:cga.vi_ c:\dos\dosshell.vid
   expand a:ega.vi_ c:\dos\dosshell.vid
   expand a:vga.vi_ c:\dos\dosshell.vid
   expand a:herc.vi_ c:\dos\dosshell.vid" (without the quotation marks)
