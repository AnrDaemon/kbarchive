SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to load HIMEM.SYS on a Tandy 1000 TX, you receive the following
error message:

   VDISK Memory Allocator Already Installed: XMS Driver Not Installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Tandy 1000 TX, an 80286 machine, uses the high memory area (HMA) for video
memory. According to the Tandy Corporation, video memory is hard-wired to the
A20 line. As a result, HIMEM.SYS does not load.

Third-party XMS memory managers also encounter a similar message.

MORE INFORMATION

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
