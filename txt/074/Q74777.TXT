======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Top Producer, a real estate package written by Top Producer Systems using
Revelation Technologies, may stop responding (hang) under MS-DOS 6, 6.2, or
6.22.

CAUSE
=====

According to Top Producer Technical Support, Top Producer has problems when the
authorization transfer signature is placed on a DoubleSpace- or
DriveSpace-compressed drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

Top Producer recommends that the authorization signature be moved from the
compressed drive to the installation floppy disk and then to the uncompressed
host drive. Top Producer supplies free of charge a utility called EZ-Move that
performs this transfer for you. This limitation also applies to Top Producer
version 1.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS-based version of Top Producer version 4.2 relies on BACKUP.COM from
MS-DOS versions 5.0 and earlier. Top Producer provides a workaround utility to
supply BACKUP functionality.

Top Producer is manufactured by Top Producer Systems, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
