SUMMARY
=======

When creating a program item in MS-DOS Shell, you have the option to password
protect the program item. The password is case sensitive. After the password is
entered, you must type it exactly as it was input; otherwise the system will
respond with a beep indicating that the password was entered in error. This also
applies to the creation of a program group.
