SUMMARY
=======

The Northgate Computer Systems OmniKey Ultra keyboard, in any of its Dvorak
configurations, is completely transparent to MS-DOS versions 3.x and later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OmniKey Ultra keyboard has the capability of changing keyboard layout
configurations. It contains a processor that receives signals from the keyboard.
The processor compares that signal to one of its four internal tables: QWERTY
(normal), Dvorak Standard, Dvorak Right-Handed, or Dvorak Left-Handed. You can
specify which table the processor look at by using a DIP switch or key
combination; see the "Keyboard Addendum to OmniKey Ultra User's Guide" for more
details.

The processor translates the impulse to the character signal that would come from
a key in the same physical position on a keyboard with the layout of the table
that the OmniKey keyboard processor is currently looking at. The processor then
passes along the translated impulse to the PC. The keyboard configuration is
completely transparent to MS-DOS and can be used with any IBM-compatible PC.
