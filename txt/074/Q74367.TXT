SUMMARY
=======

When trying to print from MS-DOS 5.0 Shell without having the MS-DOS print
spooler installed, you are instructed to run PRINT.COM before starting Shell.
You are also referred to the online Help in Shell, which refers to the print
spooler as PRINT.COM. Both instances of PRINT.COM are incorrect; the print
spooler's correct filename is PRINT.EXE.

You must either exit Shell and execute the PRINT command or disable Task Swapper
and execute the PRINT command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The syntax of the PRINT command is as follows:

   print [/d:device][/b:size][/u:ticks1][/m:ticks2][/s:ticks3][/q:qsize]
   [/t][[drive:] [path]filename[...]][/c][/p]

For more information on PRINT.EXE (including switches), see page 542 of the
version 5.0 "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
