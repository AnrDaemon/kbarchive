SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the LBP8II.DRV driver that comes with Windows 3.0, you may experience
a problem when printing through certain Windows applications with the Canon
LBP-8II printer with less than 1 megabyte of memory. The error message "Full
Paint Reject" may display on the printer when printing graphical file formats.

RESOLUTION
==========

Canon has addressed this problem and recommends that if you have the LBP- 8II
with less than 1 megabyte of memory, you should use the LBP8III.DRV from Canon
and NOT the LBP8II.DRV that comes with Microsoft Windows 3.0.

The Canon LBP8III.DRV driver can be obtained from Canon technical support.
