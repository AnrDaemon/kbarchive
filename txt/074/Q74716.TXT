The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SUMMARY
=======

By double-clicking an associated file inside of File Manager, you can execute or
view that file. If, however, you attempt to use File Manager's Print command
with a file that contains formatting other than text, you may experience
unreadable text or no printing at all.

This information applies to Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a. This does
not apply to later versions of Windows.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Most applications have a print command that you can use to print files created
with the application. You should use that command rather than File Manager's
Print command whenever possible. Applications usually provides formatting
capabilities and other options that enhance the appearance of the printed
material. These formats are not supported by the File Manager Print command.

Only text files will print reliably when using File Manager. (Files created by
Notepad, for example, are text files.) Text files contain no special formatting
or characters and are usually identified by a .TXT extension. If you use File
Manager's Print command to print a file that is not a text file, some unreadable
characters may appear in the printout, or nothing may print at all.
