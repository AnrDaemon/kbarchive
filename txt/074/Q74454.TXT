SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Colorado Tape Backup on your system, and when you try to exit a
program that has been run from MS-DOS Shell, you receive an error message
similar to one of the following:

   Unable to Load MS-DOS Shell

   -or-

   Unable to Unload MS-DOS Shell

If you choose the RETRY button you are returned to MS-DOS Shell. If you choose
the NO button, you are returned to the MS-DOS command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

According to Colorado Memory Systems, when you load the automatic backup program
from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, it causes a memory conflict with Shell. If its
automatic tape backup program is loaded from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, it does not
leave enough memory for Shell to operate properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

A workaround for this problem is to load the automatic tape backup program from
the MS-DOS command prompt, instead of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
