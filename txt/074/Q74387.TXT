SUMMARY
=======

The tablet drivers supplied by Microsoft as part of the release of Windows for
Pen Computing will work correctly if the tablet is connected to COM2. Connecting
the tablet in this manner keeps COM1 free for the debugging information that is
displayed by CodeView for Windows or WDEB386.

To instruct the tablet driver to install on COM2, it is necessary to modify the
[Pen Driver] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to include the following line:

   com2=1

The next time the system loads, it will use COM2 for the tablet.
