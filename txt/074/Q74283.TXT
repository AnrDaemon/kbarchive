SUMMARY
=======

The user can control the color that the Microsoft Windows Help application uses
to display hypertext strings by using the JumpColor and PopupColor settings in
the [Windows Help] section of the WIN.INI file. The JumpColor setting specifies
the color for context strings, and the PopupColor setting specifies the color
for definition strings. Both settings use the following syntax:

      setting=(r,g,b)

where r, g, and b are decimal values in the range 0 to 255 that specify a color
value as a red-green-blue (RGB) triplet.

For example:

      [Windows Help]
      JumpColor=(128,0,0)     ; produces red context strings
      PopupColor=(0,128,128)  ; produces cyan definition strings

The default color for both types of hypertext strings is green.

The Windows Help Compiler documentation in the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK) discusses context and definition strings in more detail.
