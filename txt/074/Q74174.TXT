-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the SET TEMP statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is invalid, MS-DOS 5.0 Shell
Task Swapper may not function properly. If this is the case, you will observe
the following symptoms:

 - When you press CTRL+ESC to return to Shell from an application, the following
   error message may be displayed:

   Your program cannot be swapped out to disk

 - An application may not start from Shell. In this event, a blank screen may
   appear for a few moments, followed by a return to Shell.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two reasons that a SET TEMP statement might be invalid:

 - SET TEMP is pointing to a directory that doesn't exist. Common examples of
   this situation include the following:

    - SET TEMP is pointing to a directory on a RAM drive without RAMDRIVE.SYS
      being loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file.

    - The directory referenced by SET TEMP was included in a Stacker incremental
      installation. (Stacker does not re-create empty directories.)

    - The hard drive was repartitioned, and SET TEMP now points to a logical
      drive that no longer exists.

 - SET TEMP will be invalid if the SET TEMP command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file contains a trailing space. For example, the final "P" in the following
   SET TEMP statement should be the last character in the line. If there are any
   blank spaces after the last character, the SET TEMP line is invalid. For
   example:

   set temp=c:\windows\temp
