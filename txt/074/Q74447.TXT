KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft MS-DOS Shell issues a version check on the mouse driver being used on
your computer. If the mouse driver is not a Microsoft or Logitech driver, the
version check is of no use. For more information, you must contact the mouse
manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS Shell first checks for the version of the mouse driver. If the driver is
version 6.14 or earlier, a check for a Logitech driver is done. If the driver is
Logitech and earlier than version 5.01, a warning message is displayed.

If a Logitech mouse driver is not detected, it is assumed that a Microsoft Mouse
driver is present. Version 6.14 or later is needed for Microsoft Mouse drivers
to be compatible with MS-DOS Shell.

Therefore, if the mouse driver being used is not Microsoft or Logitech, the
information given by the check is most likely incorrect. In this case, Microsoft
is unable to state whether or not MS-DOS Shell will experience problems with
your driver. For more information, contact the manufacturer of the mouse driver.
