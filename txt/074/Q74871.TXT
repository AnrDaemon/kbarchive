The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Leading Edge XT computers are shipped with only Phoenix BIOS and require either
version 3.0 or 3.1 of Phoenix BIOS to set up and run correctly with MS-DOS
version 5.0 or later. A BIOS upgrade is available from Leading Edge directly or
from a Leading Edge distributor. Version 3.11 of Phoenix BIOS (currently the
latest version) should not be used as an upgrade, however, because it does not
work properly with MS-DOS 5.0 or later on a Leading Edge XT computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Leading Edge has acknowledged that either version 3.0 or 3.1 of Phoenix BIOS is
required on their XT-class computers to work correctly with MS-DOS 5.0 or later.
If an earlier version is used, the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 or later Upgrade will not
install. After SETUP is typed at the command prompt, the cursor appears below
the prompt, and the system hangs, requiring a system restart (both a "cold" and
a "warm" restart usually work). A similar effect also occurs when version 3.11
(the latest release) of Phoenix BIOS is used.

Leading Edge is providing a BIOS upgrade for $45.00. To receive this upgrade,
mail Leading Edge at the address below, and include the model number of the
computer and a money order for $45.00. The upgrade is also available through
Leading Edge distributors (usually at a higher cost than purchasing directly
through Leading Edge.)

If version 3.11 is causing the problem, there is no "downgrade" currently
available. A future release of Phoenix BIOS for the Leading Edge XT might
provide compatibility.

The product included here, Leading Edge XT, is manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
