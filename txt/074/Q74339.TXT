SUMMARY
=======

The current version of Hyperdisk 4.21 conflicts with Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade
SETUP.EXE and FORMAT.COM.

Hyperdisk fails to monitor the change of media BIOS call and fails to recognize a
disk swap. This causes difficulties with SETUP and FORMAT.

To resolve this problem, use the /OC switch on the Hyperdisk device driver line
in the CONFIG.SYS file. For example:

      DEVICE=C:\HYPERDK.EXE /OC
