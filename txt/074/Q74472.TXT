SUMMARY
=======

When initializing a device driver in the Microsoft Windows graphical
environment, perform as much of the initialization as possible in the
Device_Init phase. Code in the Sys_Critical_Init and Init_Complete sections
should be minimal.

When the driver processes hooked interrupts, regardless of the initialization
order value, all devices are called with Sys_Critical_Init before any are called
for Device_Init. Therefore, regardless of the initialization order, all hooks
done during Device_Init will occur after all hooks done during
Sys_Critical_Init.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10 DDKVXD VxD hook interrupt
