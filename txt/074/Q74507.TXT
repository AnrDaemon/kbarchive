a system modal dialog box, the following problem occurs in Windows versions 3.0,
3.1, and Windows 95:

 - You cannot select an item from the drop-down list box by clicking it with the
   mouse. The original selection remains in the edit control or static-text
   control.

system modal dialog box in Windows version 3.0, the following problems occur:

 - You cannot close the drop-down list box by clicking on a part of the list box
   that lies outside the dialog box.

 - The parts of the drop-down list box that lie outside the dialog box are not
   erased when the drop-down list box is closed.

list box.
