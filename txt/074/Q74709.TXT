The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to format a 3.5-inch high density (1.44 MB) floppy disk as a low
density (720K) disk, the following error message may be displayed:

   Invalid Media or Track 0 Bad - Disk Unusable.

This is due to the ability of some floppy drives to sense the media type of
3.5-inch disks. High density 3.5-inch disks have two holes in the disk shell.
Low density 3.5-inch disks have only the write- protected hole. The disk will
format correctly as a 1.44 MB disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To make a floppy drive recognize a high density disk as a low density disk,
cover the second hole (not the write-protected hole) in the disk shell.
