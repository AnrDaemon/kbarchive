SUMMARY
=======

If you receive an "Insufficient disk space" error message when running Visual
Basic's Setup program, it may be caused by using Windows with a temporary
Windows swap file instead of the permanent Windows swap file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Pages 520 through 529 in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" version 3.0 manual
discuss Windows swap files. Permanent swap files are contiguous so that your
disk does not contain files in fragmented pieces, which may happen if you are
using temporary swap files. Temporary Windows swap files may grow in size, which
may cause the "Insufficient disk space" error during the execution of Visual
Basic's Setup program. However, permanent Windows swap files will not change in
size, so using permanent Windows swap files may help to avoid the "Insufficient
disk space" error.
