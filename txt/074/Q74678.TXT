================

To change the Write margins, follow these steps:

1. In Write, choose Page Layout from the Document menu to get the margins dialog
   box.

2. Change the margin settings to your preference and choose OK.

3. Save the file as <filename>.WRI and close Write (it is not necessary to
   insert any dummy text in the file).

4. Highlight the Write icon and choose Properties from the File menu under
   Program Manager.

5. In the command line, replace WRITE.EXE with <filename>.WRI and choose
   OK to save the change.

   default document. Enter the desired text and choose Save As from the File
   menu to save the document to a different filename so that the default
   <filename>.WRI is not changed.
