======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft.NET Alerts 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the alerts sender to connect to the Alerts database, you may
receive the following error message:

   The requested name is valid and was found in the database, but it does not
   have the correct associated data being resolved for.

CAUSE
=====

An incorrect setting in the NotificationTransport.Proxy variable causes this
error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, set the NotificationTransport.Proxy variable to your
Proxy system (NotificationTransport.Proxy = "proxysystem").

NOTE: In some cases the reverse is true. A computer may generate this error if
the NotificationTransport.Proxy variable has been set and if there is no proxy
for the system to run through.
