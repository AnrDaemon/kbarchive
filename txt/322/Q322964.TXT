TITLE   :XADM: An Exchange Server 5.5 Reinstallation Stops Responding
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5,SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 2 (SP2)
with Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), if you run Exchange Server 5.5 Setup,
and then click the Reinstall option, Setup stops responding during the "Making
sure system is ready for installation" portion of Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the process that backs up the Webdata folder,
Xcopy.exe, is running in the background. This process requires input from the
user to verify a file overwrite. However, this process is silent. Therefore, the
user does not have an opportunityto verify this information. The process waits
for verification indefinitely.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, stop the Xcopy.exe process:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL, and then click Task Manager.

2. Click the Processes tab.

3. Locate the xcopy.exe process, and then click it.

4. Click End Task.

After you stop the Xcopy.exe process, Setup continues. However, if you stop the
Xcopy.exe process, the Webdata folder is not backed up. Therefore, if you use
custom OWA Active Server Pages (ASP) pages, Microsoft recommends that you back
up the Webdata folder manually before you continue with the reinstallation.
