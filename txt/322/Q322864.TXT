   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you delete files from a location that is shared by Server For NFS, the
files do not immediately go away. Although the file or files seem to remain, you
cannot use the file or files.

CAUSE
=====

NFS Server caches file handles for a period of time that is determined by the
following two registry values:

   RdWrHandleLifeTime
   RdWrThreadLifeTime

These values are located in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NfsSvr\Parameters

The duration for which a handle stays in the cache beyond the time it was last
accessed is the product of the preceding two values in seconds. By default, both
values are set to 5, and this means a duration of 25 seconds.

Formula
-------

   RdWrHandleLifeTime * RdWrThreadLifeTime = time handle stays in cache

Example
-------

   5 * 5 = 25 seconds

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

If server usage is predominantly done by using NFS, increase one or both of these
values to improve performance:

   RdWrHandleLifeTime
   RdWrThreadLifeTime

Microsoft does not recommend that you use a total duration of more than 100
seconds because it may lead to extra caching of file handles on the server side.
Too much caching may lead to too much memory and handle consumption.

If the server is being used in a multi-mode environment (CIFS and NFS), leave the
total duration as it is, or reduce it to a minimum of 10 seconds.
