   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to exclude a particular file type from being scanned
and indexed, which can increase indexing performance by reducing the number of
files that Index Server has to evaluate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Index Server has to scan each file in a catalog even though the file may not be
ultimately filtered. This can cause performance problems in some environments
where a number of files exist that do not have to be scanned, but must remain in
the catalog directory.

To exclude certain file extensions from being scanned on a per catalog basis.
Note that the catalog must be rebuilt, follow these steps:

1. Start Regedit.exe.

2. Select the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex\Catalogs\YOURCATALOG\Scopes

3. Add the following in the Scopes section:

Name: *.tif
Data Type: REG_SZ
Data: ,,4

4. Stop Indexing Service, and then delete the contents of the Catalog.wci
   directory for your catalog.

5. Restart Indexing Service and let the catalog build completely.
