TITLE   :Advanced Local Maps Use a Different Name Format in SFU 3.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows Services For UNIX (SFU) 2.0 mapping server stores advanced maps that
have been created by using local accounts with the computer name as part of the
map:

   <computer name>\<local user account>

In SFU 3.0, these maps are stored with the universal $LocalHost machine name:

   $LOCALHOST\<local user account>

When you move SFU 2.0 maps to an SFU 3.0 mapping server, you must delete and then
re-create these maps.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.

Only a Few Advanced Maps
------------------------

If there are only a few advanced maps, delete them by using SFU Administrator.
Note that the MAPADMIN command-line utility cannot delete these maps.

Many Advanced Maps
------------------

If there are lots of advanced maps, edit the backup file, and make the changes
before you restore to the new mapping server.

The backup file is a simple text file in the following format:

   *:\\<computer
   name>\ntuser:1:nisdomain:nisserver:unixuser:passwd:uid:gid:

Open the backup file in a text editor (such as Notepad.exe), and then replace the
<computer name> with the $LOCALHOST value by using the Replace command on
the Edit menu:

   *:\\$LOCALHOST\ntuser:1:nisdomain:nisserver:unixuser:passwd:uid:gid:
