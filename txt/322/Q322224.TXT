SUMMARY
=======

The example in the System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.InstanceDescriptor
class documentation is incorrect in the online Microsoft Developer Network
(MSDN) documentation and in the January 2002 media for MSDN. The values that are
passed into the constructor do not get assigned to the properties of the class.

To see the System.ComponentModel.Design.Serialization.InstanceDescriptor class
documentation, visit the following MSDN Web site:

   InstanceDescriptor Class
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemComponentModelDesignSerializationInstanceDescriptorClassTopic.asp

MORE INFORMATION
================

The constructor contains ambiguous naming conventions for the constructor
arguments and the property procedure names. The property values are stored in
private variables of the class but do not get initialized because of this
ambiguity.

To correctly implement the constructor, fully qualify the property procedures.
When you fully qualify property procedures, any values that are passed into the
property procedures are validated, and private variables are initialized.

For example, use the following Microsoft Visual Basic code to correct this
problem in the sample:

      Public Sub New(ByVal point1 As Point, ByVal point2 As Point, ByVal point3 As Point)
         Me.Point1 = point1
         Me.Point2 = point2
         Me.Point3 = point3
      End Sub 'New

Use the following Microsoft Visual C# code to correct this problem in the
sample:

      public Triangle(Point point1,Point point2,Point point3) {
         this.Point1 = point1;
         this.Point2 = point2;
         this.Point3 = point3;
      }
