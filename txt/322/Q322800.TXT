SUMMARY
=======

You can improve Client For NFS performance by turning off the ability to
translate file names on an NFS share to the 8.3 format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To turn off the ability to translate file names on an NFS share to the 8.3
format, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Client for
   NFS\CurrentVersion\Users\Default\Defaults

Edit the following value:

   Value Name: 8.3Format
   Value Type: REG_DWORD
   Value:
   0 is 8.3 translation is turned off
   1 is 8.3 translation is turned on (the default setting)

After you make this change, stop and then restart the Client For NFS service.

NOTE: After you turn off 8.3 translation, you cannot run a 16-bit program from an
NFS share by using the Client For NFS. If you try to do so, you receive the
following error message:

   Cannot run 16 bit application
