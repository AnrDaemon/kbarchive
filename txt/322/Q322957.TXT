======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft.NET Alerts 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You no longer have to use a specialized CategoryID when you send an Alert.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The use of a specialized CategoryID will no longer be supported and the Alerts
Software Development Kit (SDK) will be updated to reflect this change. To
correct this, specify a category ID of "100000000" (without the quotation marks)
in all relevant places. This represents "All Categories" in the .NET Alerts
system.
