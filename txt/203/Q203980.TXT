TITLE   :PRB: Error 282 Connecting to VB5 or VB6 DDE Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDDE kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to connect to a Visual Basic 5.0 or Visual Basic 6.0 DDE server,
the following error message might appear:

   Error 282 - No Foreign Application Responded to a DDE Initiate.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic versions 5.0 and 6.0 use the application title as the DDE
Application. This problem is most likely to occur if you have recently converted
the project from Visual Basic versions 3.0 or 4.0. These prior versions of
Visual Basic used the project executable name (not including the .exe extension)
as the DDE source's application name.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the DDE client, otherwise known as the destination, to connect to the
server using the application title of the server instead of the executable
filename (not including the .exe extension).

The application title is located on the Make tab of the Project Properties dialog
box.
