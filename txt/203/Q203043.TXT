TITLE   :Windows NT Diagnostics Does Not Locate a Client Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHelpDesk

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Diagnostics in the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator
console relies solely on name resolution to locate an SMS client. The following
error message is displayed if a computer that is running the SMS Administrator
console is not able to locate an SMS client through name resolution:

   A Windows NT system named \\<Computer name> could not be found on the
   network

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Diagnostics in the SMS Administrator console does not use the
client's IP address from the SMS database. It uses only name resolution to
locate the SMS client.

WORKAROUND
==========

As a workaround, run the following command to invoke Windows NT Diagnostics
using the client's IP address:

   winmsd.exe \\<IP address>
