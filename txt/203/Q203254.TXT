======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are four localized versions of Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5.

 - English

 - French

 - German

 - Japanese

Microsoft Exchange Server supports three encryption algorithms:

 - CAST-64

 - DES

 - CAST-40

There are no separate high and low encryption codes for Microsoft Exchange
Server. Microsoft Exchange Server code is the same worldwide. The level of
encryption is determined by the Microsoft Exchange Client or Outlook client, not
Exchange Server.

The U.S./Canada versions of all Exchange Client products support all three
algorithms, but default to CAST-64. All other international (localized) versions
of Exchange Client support only the CAST-40 (40 bit) algorithm.

Microsoft does not produce a generic International version of Microsoft Exchange
Server.
