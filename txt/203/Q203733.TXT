PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Quarterdeck Cleansweep version 3.0 Registry
Wizard, you may be unable to do so, and you may receive the following error
message:

   Unable to initialize DAO/Jet db engine.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur after you have installed the Microsoft Paint (Paint95.exe)
update. The Paint95.exe update replaces the Mfc42.dll file in the Windows\System
folder on your computer, and this file is not totally compatible with
Quarterdeck Cleansweep version 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact Quarterdeck to inquire about the availability of
a fix for this issue.

To work around this issue, restore the Mfc42.dll file from your Cleansweep
installation media to the Windows\System folder on your computer. For
information about how to do so, contact Quarterdeck.
