TITLE   :XADM: NT Account for DL Owner Is Not Added to Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set the Owner mailbox when you create a Distribution List (DL), the
primary Windows NT account of the Owner mailbox is placed in the "Windows NT
accounts with permissions" list for the DL with the role of "User."

If the Owner mailbox is assigned at a later date, or changed to another mailbox
with a different primary Windows NT account, the "Windows NT accounts with
permissions" list may not be updated to reflect the new primary Windows NT
account.

CAUSE
=====

The administrator modifying the DL does not have the Modify Permissions right
for the site level naming context. The Modify Permissions right is granted only
to administrators who have the Permissions Admin. role (that is, an
administrator who has the Admin. role does not have the "right" to modify
permissions).

An administrator who does not have the right to modify permissions may only set
permissions at object creation. All subsequent modifications to the object that
require alterations to the "Windows NT accounts with permissions" list must be
done by an administrator who has the right to modify permissions.

WORKAROUND
==========

Give administrators who need the ability to modify the permissions of DLs or any
other object in the site naming context the role of Permissions Admin. for the
site naming context.
