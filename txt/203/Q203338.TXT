TITLE   :16-Bit Apps Fail if Names Longer Than 8.3 Naming Convention
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or the IntranetWare Client with
Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0, and you attempt to access 16-bit
applications on a NetWare Server in Bindery mode, the applications fail to
start. This behavior occurs if the path to the executable file from the drive
mapping contains folder names that are longer than allowed by the 8.3 naming
convention.

For example, the following path fails

   \\Server\Exchange5.0\Windowsnt\Setup.exe

while this path succeeds:

   \\Server\Exch5.0\Winnt\Setup.exe

With CSNW, when the path is too long, you receive the following error message:

   Path not found

With the IntranetWare Client, you receive this error message:

   Invalid path


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, rename the folders on the server to conform to the
8.3 naming convention, or map the drive to the application so that file names
longer than allowed by the 8.3 naming convention are not in the path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Workstation
version 4.0.
