Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Installation
--------------------------------------------------

The following sections cover the installation of Windows NT Server/E.

 - New Windows NT Server/E Installations
 - Upgrading Existing Windows NT Installations
 - Domain Considerations
 - Computer Name Considerations
 - Installing MSCS
 - Installing MSMQ
 - Installing MTS
 - Installing FrontPage 97
 - Installing Internet Information Server Version 3.0
 - Installing Debug Files
 - Reapplying Service Pack 3

New Windows NT Server/E Installations
Installing a new copy of Windows NT Server/E is a two step process:

 - First, install Windows NT Server/E in the same way that you install Windows
   NT Server.
 - After you install Windows NT Server/E, install Service Pack 3. (A prompt
   reminds you to do this each time you log in, until you have done so.)

Both steps are required to have a functioning Windows NT Server, Enterprise
Edition system.
Before installing Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition, ensure you are using
appropriate hardware. For more information, see "Hardware Compatibility Lists"
earlier in this document.

Note: Windows NT Server/E Setup places the following string into your Boot.ini
file (for Intel processors) or NVRAM (for Alpha-based computers): /MAXMEM=256
This string is used to resolve a memory-limitation issue that can occur with
Windows NT 4.0 build 1381 on computers with more than 256 megabytes (MB) of
physical memory. The Windows NT Server/E component installer removes this
switch.

Note: If you plan to cluster MSMQ, it is recommended that you install Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers during this stage of Windows NT Server/E
installation. To do so, make sure that you first select SQLServer on the list of
available ODBC drivers when you are prompted to select one or more ODBC drivers,
and only then click OK.

Upgrading Existing Windows NT Installations
-------------------------------------------

Winnt32.exe should not be used to upgrade from an existing Windows NT Server
installation to Windows NT Server/E if you are running Service Pack 2 or later.
If you use Winnt32.exe to install Windows NT Server/E, and then apply Service
Pack 3, your system is left in an inconsistent state with incorrect revision
levels of some system components. This can cause severe problems, including
reboot failures. To upgrade an existing Windows NT Server installation that is
running Service Pack 2 or later, use Winntup.exe.

Note: Before installing Windows NT Server/E, ensure you are using appropriate
hardware. For more information, see "Hardware Compatibility Lists" earlier in
this document.

Using Winntup.exe to Upgrade to Windows NT Server/E
---------------------------------------------------

Winntup.exe can be used to upgrade existing Windows NT Server installations to
Windows NT Server/E. Running Winntup.exe takes significantly less time to run
than does Winnt32.exe, and your system never enters an inconsistent state. After
running Winntup.exe, you must still install Service Pack 3 from the Windows NT
Server/E Base CD (if Service Pack 3 or later is not already installed).

Note: Winntup.exe does not modify the maximum number of processors supported in
your computer. Therefore, if you have a computer that you want to upgrade to
Windows NT Server/E and also want to support more than four processors, you must
install a new copy of Windows NT Server/E. Winntup.exe cannot be used to upgrade
a Windows NT Workstation installation to Windows NT Server/E. If you have a
computer running Windows NT Workstation, you must install a new copy of Windows
NT Server/E.

To start Winntup.exe, run the file from the \i386 folder or the \Alpha folder on
the Windows NT Server/E 4.0 Base CD. You can also run Winntup.exe from the
auto-run screen that appears when you place the Windows NT Server/E 4.0 Base CD
into your CD-ROM drive.

Winnt32.exe Changes for Windows NT Server/E
-------------------------------------------

If you attempt to upgrade an existing Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server
installation that is running Service Pack 2 or later using Winnt32.exe, the
following message appears:

   You are installing Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition on a system where a
   Windows NT Service Pack has been installed. Setup for Windows NT Server,
   Enterprise Edition is only to be used for a new installation. Choose 'Cancel'
   and use the Windows NT Upgrade option to upgrade your current configuration.

If you click OK, Winnt32.exe continues installing Windows NT Server/E. However,
if you specified the /u switch, Winnt32.exe exits when you click OK or Cancel --
Windows NT Server/E Winn32.exe does not support unattended upgrades. This change
was introduced to prevent you from inadvertently moving backward from a later
Service Pack to Service Pack 1.

Domain Considerations
---------------------

If you intend to install MSCS, MSMQ, or MTS, you should first consider the impact
of installing Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition as a member server, backup
domain controller (BDC), or primary domain controller (PDC). For example, if you
install MSCS on member servers or on two BDCs in an existing domain, you
preserve your existing domain model. If you create a new domain and install MSCS
on a PDC and a BDC, you must establish domain trusts with your existing domains
to enable users to access the MSCS servers. Installing MSMQ on BDCs or PDCs in a
domain where account changes occur regularly or in which users log off and log
on frequently can adversely affect MSMQ performance.
For more information on these issues, see "Choosing a Domain Model" in Chapter 2,
"Planning Your Cluster Environment" of the Microsoft Cluster Server
Administrator's Guide. For complete instructions on installing and
troubleshooting Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Setup, see Windows NT
Server Version 4.0 Start Here.

Computer Name Considerations
----------------------------

For compatibility with MSCS and MSMQ, it is recommended that the computer name
should contain only English characters and/or ANSI characters below 128. The
name should not contain extended characters.

Installing MSCS
---------------

MSCS can be installed from the Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Components
CD. You can either select the Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) check box in the
Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Installer, or run Setup.exe from the
appropriate platform subfolder of the \MSCS\cluster folder on the Windows NT
Server, Enterprise Edition Components CD. For general information on installing
MSCS, see Chapter 3, "Setting Up an MSCS Cluster," in the MSCS Administrator's
Guide.

Installing MSMQ
---------------

MSMQ can be installed from the Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Components
CD. You can either select the Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ) check box on the
Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition component installation logon screen, or
run Setup.exe from the \MSMQ\MSMQ\Server folder on the Windows NT Server,
Enterprise Edition Components CD.

Note: If Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) is installed, you can only install MSMQ
servers and independent clients as fail safe services - you cannot install them
without configuring them as MSCS resources.

For general information on installing MSMQ, see Chapter 2, "Installing MSMQ," in
the MSMQ Administrator's Guide. For specific instructions on installing MSMQ for
failover in an MSCS cluster, see "Clustering MSMQ" later in this document.

Installing MTS
--------------

MTS can be installed from the Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Components
CD. You can either select the Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) check box on
the Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition component installation logon screen,
or run Setup.exe from the appropriate platform subfolder of the \MTS\ folder on
the Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Components CD. For general information
on installing MTS, run Mtx10.hlp from the appropriate platform subfolder of the
\MTS\ folder on the Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Components CD. For
specific instructions on installing MTS for failover in an MSCS cluster, see
"Clustering MTS" later in this document.

Installing FrontPage 97
-----------------------

FrontPage 97 can be installed from the Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition
Components CD. You can either select the Microsoft FrontPage97 check box on the
Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition component installation logon screen, or
run Setup.exe from the \FrontPg\i386 folder on the Windows NT Server, Enterprise
Edition Components CD 2.

Installing Internet Information Server Version 3.0
--------------------------------------------------

Internet Information Server (IIS) 2.0, if currently installed, will be upgraded
by Service Pack 3 to IIS 3.0. If IIS 2 is not currently installed, use the
Network option in Control Panel to install IIS 2.0 (by clicking Add on the
Services tab) and then upgrade to IIS 3.0 (by reinstalling Service Pack 3 or
using the Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition component installer.

Installing Debug Files
----------------------

Debug files for MSCS, MSMQ, and MTS are located in the Windows NT Server,
Enterprise Edition Components CD in the following path:
\Support\Symbols\Components\

Reapplying Service Pack 3
-------------------------

If you change or add new software or hardware components to your system after you
have installed Service Pack 3, you must install Service Pack 3 again. You cannot
install new components directly from the Service Pack folder (such as a new
keyboard or printer driver). You must install new components from the Windows NT
Server/E Base CD and then reinstall the Service Pack.
For example, if you install the SNMP service after installing Service Pack 3, you
must reinstall the Service Pack. If you do not, the error "Entrypoint
SnmpSvcGetEnterpriseOID could not be located in snmpapi.dll" appears because
some of the files in the SNMP service have been updated in the Service Pack and
you have a version mismatch. Reinstalling the Service Pack fixes the problem by
copying the newer versions of the files to your system.

Note: If you are reinstalling the Service Pack after installing new software or
hardware, you must choose to create a new uninstall directory. To indicate this,
click Yes, I want to create an Uninstall directory when you are prompted.

Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Component Installation
------------------------------------------------------------

Each time you log on, Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition Setup:

 - Prompts you to install Service Pack 3 (if you have not already done so).
 - Gives you the option to install MSCS, MSMQ, MTS, FrontPage 97, and Internet
   Explorer 3.02 (after you have installed Service Pack 3).

You are not given the option to install MSCS, MSMQ, MTS, FrontPage 97, and
Internet Explorer 3.02, until you have installed Service Pack 3. You can disable
the logon prompt for installing these components by clicking to clear the Show
this installer next time you start Windows NT check box on the logon install
option screen.

Note: The Internet Information Server 3.0 upgrade option will upgrade an IIS 2.0
installation to IIS 3.0. If IIS 2 is not currently installed, open Control
Panel, double-click Network, on the Services tab click Microsoft Internet
Information Server, and then click OK. After installing IIS 2.0, you can upgrade
to IIS 3.0.

If you choose to install multiple optional components, the installer installs
each component in the appropriate order. If you click Cancel, you exit from only
the install program that is running. For example, if you choose to install MSCS
and MSMQ, and then click Cancel to exit from MSCS Setup, you much click Cancel
twice more to exit from both MSMQ Setup and from the installer. This cancels the
installation of both MSCS and MSMQ. To run the component installer after
disabling it (by clearing the Show this installer next time you start Windows NT
check box), run Nhloader.exe from the Windows NT \system32 folder (typically
C:\Winnt\system32).
