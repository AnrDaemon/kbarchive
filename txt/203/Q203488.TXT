TITLE   :WD97: File Corruption Error Starting Multiple Instances of Word
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start multiple instances of Microsoft Word 97 rapidly in succession,
the following error message may appear:

   Word encountered file corruption while opening c:\Program
   Files\...Normal.dot. Part of this document may be recoverable. Attempt
   recovery now?

You can click NO to start Word. The Normal template (Normal.dot) is not damaged.

CAUSE
=====

This error message appears because the first instance of Word has not fully
initialized when the second instance of Word is started.

When you start Word, an entry is written to the Windows registry indicating that
the program has started. After Word is fully initialized, the registry entry is
removed. Word uses this registry entry to determine whether the initialization
process failed or succeeded. If the entry exists in the registry, Word
determines that the initialization of the first instance of Word failed and
displays the error message. If the entry does not exist, Word determines that
the initialization process succeeded, and no error message appears.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, wait until the first instance of Word has finished
initializing before starting the second instance.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
