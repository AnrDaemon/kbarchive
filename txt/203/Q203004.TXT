The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator Console, the
Secondary Site Creation Wizard gives you the option of transferring source files
to the secondary site server from the primary site server, or of specifying that
the installation source files are on a CD-ROM at the secondary site server. If
the second option is selected, the Setup program searches for installation
source files from a local CD-ROM or a shared network CD-ROM drive.

If source files from the installation CD-ROM are copied to a local hard disk on
the secondary site server, Setup fails to find them because it looks for the
source files on the CD-ROM drive. If the installation CD-ROM is not inserted in
the CD-ROM drive, Setup fails.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to use installation source files on the local hard disk by
sharing out the folder where they reside, and then connecting to it as a network
drive by using the net use command. This method allows you to copy the source
files to the local hard disk of the secondary site server and have Setup find
them there. This method can be useful for a customer whose clients are spread
across a large geographic area with local area network (LAN) and wide area
network (WAN) connections. These clients can load the operating system and all
necessary software on the servers, copy the SMS 2.0 CD-ROM files locally to
various servers' hard disks, ship the servers to their destinations, and then
initiate the Create Secondary Site process, directing Setup to search for the
source files locally.

Creating a Secondary Site Using Local Source Files on a Secondary Site Server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy the source files from the SMS 2.0 CD-ROM to a folder on a local drive of
   the secondary site server.

2. Share out the folder and connect to it (from the same computer) using the net
   use command, in effect, creating a network connection.

3. Initiate secondary site creation by clicking the "Installation source files
   are on a CD-ROM at secondary site server" option.
