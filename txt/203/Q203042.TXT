PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SMS Resource Explorer does not show some non-Intel processors correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Manufacturer0 column in the Processor_DATA table in the SMS database shows a
NULL value for some non-Intel processors. The NULL value is displayed because
the X86 processor does not support the CPUID instruction and Systems Management
Server cannot determine the name of the manufacturer.

Also, all Alpha processors report Compaq as the manufacturer since Compaq
purchased DEC and the Alpha processor.

Additional query words: prodsms hwinv16 hwinv32
