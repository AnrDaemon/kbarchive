======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When doing a repackage in Systems Management Server Installer and a reboot is
made during the repackage, Systems Management Server Installer does not
automatically restart and continue with the repackage after the reboot is
complete.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Restart Systems Management Server Installer, and click Repackage. A pop-up
window is displayed that reads:

   A previous repackage is currently in progress. Do you want to complete that
   repackage?

Click Yes and the repackage will continue.

This behavior is by design and allows for additional applications to be installed
or additional changes to be made to the computer before SMS Installer completes
the repackage.

Additional query words: prodsms SMSInst
