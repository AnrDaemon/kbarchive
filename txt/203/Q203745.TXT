With the Windows NT 4.0 DHCP server, you can create a Reservation that is
outside a particular scope range but still within the subnet. If you delete the
database and need to perform a Reconcile to recover your lease information, you
will lose any reservations that are outside the Scope. Reservations defined
within scopes are recovered.
