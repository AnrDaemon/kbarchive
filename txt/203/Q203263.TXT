SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a Cirel FPX X.25 network adapter in your Windows NT-based
computer, the network adapter may not function properly.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you install a Cirel FPX X.25 network adapter with the
Cirel driver software. The Cirel driver software does not install two values in
the Windows NT registry that are required for this network adapter to function
properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot

incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.
