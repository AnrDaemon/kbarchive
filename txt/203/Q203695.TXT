SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 99, the introductory audio played
when the Home screen is displayed may be broken up or choppy.

CAUSE

This behavior can occur if a CD-ROM changer is installed in your computer and
both Encarta Encyclopedia 99 compact discs are inserted in the CD-ROM changer at
the same time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods.

 - Insert only one of the Encarta Encyclopedia compact discs in the CD-ROM
   changer at any one time. When you are prompted to insert the other Encarta
   Encyclopedia CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, remove the Encarta CD-ROM that is
   currently in the CD-ROM changer before you insert the other disc.

 - Disable the display of the Home screen when you start Encarta Encyclopedia
   99. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. Start Encarta Encyclopedia 99.

   2. Click Options, and then click Settings.

   3. Click to clear the "Display Home screen when I start Encarta Encyclopedia"
      check box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia
99.
