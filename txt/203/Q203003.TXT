Remote Control Performance
--------------------------

You can improve remote control performance by performing the following steps:

 - Enable 16-color viewing on the client.

 - Suppress the client background wallpaper for Windows NT clients. For Windows
   95 and Windows 98 clients, even if suppress client wallpaper is enabled, you
   must disable and then reenable this option.

 - If you do not need Administrators in languages other than English, then you
   should remove any others that are on the Permitted Viewers list. To access
   this list to remove them, in the SMS Administrator console, go to Client
   Agents. Right-click Remote Tools Client Agent, and then select Properties.

 - For Windows NT computers, enable video acceleration.

 - Make sure to use Run Length Encoding (RLE) compression.

 - Disable the Active Desktop.

Resource Guide", Chapter 9 - Remote Tools for the Advanced User.
