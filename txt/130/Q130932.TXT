SYMPTOMS

If you lock your local workstation using CTRL+ALT+DEL, and then an administrator
logs you off of that machine locally (using CTRL+ALT+DEL), the desktop becomes
active for approx. 5-10 seconds (depending on what processes are active, etc.).
During this time, the administrator can see the desktop, any open files, and can
even manipulate objects on the desktop.

done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.
