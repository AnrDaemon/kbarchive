SUMMARY
=======

Japanese Windows 3.1 requires DOS/V (Japanese MS-DOS). DOS/V has two different
modes, English and Japanese modes. The CHEV command is used to change between
these two modes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSKK of Japan released DOS5/V and DOS6/V. DOS/V has two different modes, and
Japanese Windows 3.1 runs only on Japanese mode.

CHEV.EXE is used in DOS5/V to temporarily change the display between English mode
and Japanese mode.

The CHEV command was added to Japanese DOS/V as a convenience to users. The
command is used similarly to such MS-DOS commands as MODE, XCOPY, and so forth.
Before running Japanese Windows, make sure that you are using the Japanese mode
of DOS/V; otherwise, use the CHEV command to change to Japanese mode.

NOTE: DOS/V EDIT.COM works only in English mode.
