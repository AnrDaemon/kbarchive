 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are several External command line options that are not used with the
Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following options can not be used with the NT MMTA, either on the command
line or in the EXTERNAL.INI file:

   AsyncInt
   AsyncPort
   DrivesNovell
   IdleProcess
   IdleProcessMinPeriod
   IdleProcessMaxPeriod
   ScreenBios
   ScreenColor
   ScreenSnow
   ScreenNone

The following options can not be used when you run External as a service, but
they can be used when you run them from a CMD prompt:

   DriveHomePO
   DrivesDirectPO
   DrivesDynamic
   DrivesWan

The options above are not used with the NT MMTA running as a service because it
dynamically allocates drives and does not use directly mapped drives.

Additional query words: 3.50 mta
