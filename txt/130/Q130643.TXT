2. Open the .RC file for that project. This will open the Resource Browser
   window, which will contain all the resources.

3. Modify any resource you want.

4. Leave this modifed resource editor window open, and double-click the system
   menu of the Resource Browser Window. This just closes the window without
   saving the changes.
