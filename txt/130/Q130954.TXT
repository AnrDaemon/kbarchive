BUG# QJet: 2138 (2.00.2317)

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, when you disconnect and connect to a Microsoft
Access database frequently, the 16-bit Access 2.00.2317 driver returns the
following error:

   Out of String Space.

CAUSE
=====

If the following steps are executed, the 16-bit Access driver produces the above
error.

1. Configure two datasources to point to two different Access databases (.MDB
   files), say DB1 and DB2.

2. Start the 16-bit ODBC Test.

3. Make a connection to DB1.

4. Run a query "select * from <view name>".

5. Make a connection to DB2.

6. Run a query "select * from <table name>".

7. Disconnect from DB1.

8. Reconnect to DB1.

9. Run the query same query in step four.

This last step should cause the "Out of String Space" error.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you do not close the connection to DB1, you can execute the query in step
four, "select * from <view name>", as many times as you wish. It only
happens if you disconnect and reconnect. Also, this problem does not occur with
the 32-bit driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ODBC Access 2.00.2317
driver. There are no plans of fixing this bug in the 16-bit driver.
