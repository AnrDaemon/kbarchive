The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A Visual FoxPro program can create a database by using the CREATE DATABASE
command, but the CREATE DATABASE command does not offer a way to create stored
procedures. This article describes how a Visual FoxPro program can add stored
procedures to a new or existing database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add a stored procedure to an existing table, use the APPEND PROCEDURE command
to take a procedure from an existing text file and add it to a database's stored
procedure.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new database, or open an existing one. For example, use the
   following command to create a database:

      CREATE DATABASE mydata

2. Create a text file that will contain the desired procedure(s) or open an
   existing procedure file. The text file should contain procedure code. Here is
   an example:

      PROCEDURE check_stuff
         IF state <> "WA" or state <>"NC"
            WAIT WINDOW 'Invalid State'
         ENDIF
      ENDPROC

   The procedure file may contain as many procedures as you want to appear in the
   database's Stored Procedures.

3. To append the procedure(s) to an existing database's Stored Procedures be
   sure the database is open, and issue the APPEND PROCEDURES command, as in
   this example:

      OPEN DATABASE mydata EXCLUSIVE
      APPEND PROCEDURE FROM textfile.txt    && Replace textfile.txt with the
                                            && actual name of your text file.

NOTE: APPEND PROCEDURES requires that the database be opened exclusively. Also,
APPEND PROCEDURES may be used to overwrite the existing stored procedures by
using the optional OVERWRITE clause, for example:

      APPEND PROCEDURE FROM textfile.txt OVERWRITE
