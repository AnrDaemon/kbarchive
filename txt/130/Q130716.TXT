KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print from an MS-DOS-based program in Windows 95, you may
receive the following error message:

   Write fault error writing device LPT1
   Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the printer has been placed in Work Offline mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps to disable the Work Offline
setting:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

2. Double-click the icon for the printer you want to print to.

3. On the Printer menu, click Work Offline to disable the setting.

Note that you can re-enable the Work Offline setting by repeating these steps.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is likely to occur on notebook computers that are removed from and
rejoined to a docking station. When a notebook computer is undocked, the printer
is automatically placed in Work Offline mode.

The Work Offline mode disables MS-DOS spooling for the local port. If there is
not a printer physically attached to the computer, printing from an MS-DOS-based
program generates the error message stated above.
