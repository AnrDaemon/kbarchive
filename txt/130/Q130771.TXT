======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Setup program for the Hayes ESP communications accelerator card causes
Windows for Workgroups Remote Access Service (RAS) and At Work Fax to not
install or work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Hayes Setup program replaces the default Windows communications driver
(COMM.DRV) with its own driver (ESP2_W31.DRV). In Windows 3.0, the Hayes driver
is ESP2_W30.DRV.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must disable the accelerator card to use RAS and At Work Fax. To do so,
change the COMM.DRV= line in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to:

      COMM.DRV=COMM.DRV

After you make this change, quit and then restart Windows.
