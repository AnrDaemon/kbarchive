The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an application attempts to access a segment of code that is not in memory,
Microsoft Windows will load it from the hard disk. If the segment cannot be
loaded into memory the following error message will be generated:

   Segment Load Failure

CAUSE
=====

Segment Load Failures can be the result of any of the following:

1. A discarded code segment has been damaged or moved.

2. Windows has insufficient resources to load the file.

3. Insufficient MS-DOS file handles.

4. Corrupt binary files.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. A discarded code segment has been damaged or moved.

   Put a fresh copy of the appropriate file on the hard disk. You can find the
   file on the Install diskettes, and then expand it, if necessary.

2. Windows has insufficient resources to load the file.

   Make sure that there are no other Windows applications running when you start
   Mail. Ensure you do not have anything on the following lines of the WIN.INI:

   LOAD=
   RUN=

   Also remove all items from the startup group, or suppress it on startup by
   pressing and holding the SHIFT key.

3. Insufficient MS-DOS file handles.

   Ensure you have following minimum setting in the CONFIG.SYS:

   FILES=60

4. Corrupt binary files.

   You may need to reinstall Windows.
