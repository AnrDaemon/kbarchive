TITLE   :PRB: Microsoft Excel 5.0 Can't Open Visual FoxPro 3.0 Table
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0; :5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to open a Visual FoxPro version 3.0 table in Microsoft Excel version
5.0 or 7.0 results in this error:

   Cannot read this binary file.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Excel version 5.0 cannot read a Visual FoxPro version 3.0 table
directly. You must export the version 3.0 table as a FoxPro version 2.X table
before Microsoft Excel version 5.0 can read it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before attempting to open the table file in Microsoft Excel, export it into
FoxPro for Windows, version 2.x format by entering the following commands in the
Command Window (assuming myfile.dbf is the table you want to open):

      USE myfile.dbf
      COPY TO myfile2.dbf TYPE FOX2

As an alternative, you can also use the FILE EXPORT command to export the file in
FoxPro for Windows, version 2.x format. Once the file is exported, Microsoft
Excel can open it.
