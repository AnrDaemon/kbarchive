When you write a custom detail status MIF, you may wish to obtain the
package ID for the current package during the running of a Package Command
Manager (PCM) job.

You should be able to obtain the name of the directory one level up from
the current working directory at the time PCM launches the job. This is
available because PCM changes the current working directory to the package
source before launching the specified workstation command.

The parent directory name can be obtained from an executable file, or from
within an Microsoft Test script, and then easily added to the information
written by the administrator-written detail. For examples, see the
BackOffice SDK Systems Management Server samples.
