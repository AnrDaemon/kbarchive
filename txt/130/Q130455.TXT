TITLE   :PRB: Long Variable Names from 2.x Not Found in Visual FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A program written in version 2.x of FoxPro demonstrates unpredictable behavior
when run in Visual FoxPro if it refers to fields or memory variables with names
containing more than 10 characters.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of additional features that have been added to
Visual FoxPro. The field or memory variable name may have been typed incorrectly
on one or more lines of code.

In FoxPro version 2.x, only the first 10 characters of procedure, field, and
memory variable names were considered significant. The following lines of code
would both update a memory variable named lmLongVari:

      lmLongVariable = "ABCD"
      lmLongVaribale = "DEFG"

After running this code in version 2.x, a single memory variable (lmLongVari)
exists, which contains a value of DEFG.

However, Visual FoxPro allows names with up to 254 characters. The same code in
Visual FoxPro would create two variables, each containing a different value.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that all names over 10 characters long are identically named in all code
that refers to them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The cross reference report contained in the version 2.x FoxDoc application, or
the Visual FoxPro Documentation Wizard, can be helpful in determining each
location where a long variable name has been used.
