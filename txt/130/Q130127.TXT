SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to design a page frame that has tabs of different
colors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro does not provide a way to manipulate tabs of a page frame
independently. It is however possible to display a page frame where pages have a
different color than their corresponding tabs.

One way to do it is to place a square shape as a control of a page, size it so
that it fits the entire page. Change the color of the shape, and send the shape
to the back. Modify the backcolor property of the page to the color you want for
the tab. All other controls placed on the page will be in front of the shape and
the background color of the box will simulate the background color of the page.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

The following steps use the Form Designer to illustrate this method.

1. Create a form.

2. Select the PageFrame control, and place a page frame on the form.

3. Right-click the page frame, and select Edit from the shortcut menu. A hatched
   border is drawn around the page frame.

4. Select Page1, and change the value of the Backcolor property to value for
   red. The entire page should now be red.

5. Select the Shape control and place it on Page1. Size the control so that it
   fits the rectangular part of the page beneath the tab. Select the Backcolor
   property of the Shape, and change it to dark gray - the default color of a
   page.

6. While the Shape is selected, choose Send to Back from the Format menu.

7. Save and run the form.

The first page now appears as gray with a red tab.
