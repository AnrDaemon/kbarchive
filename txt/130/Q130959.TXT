TITLE   :Windows NT Setup Cannot Install PCMCIA SCSI Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Setup does not detect and cannot install a PCMCIA SCSI controller.

CAUSE
=====

This is currently part of the Windows NT design. PCMCIA SCSI controllers cannot
be used as boot devices (this is a PCMCIA limitation). Because Windows NT setup
cannot determine whether the user is trying to install Windows NT on a PCMCIA
drive, Setup was modified to ignore PCMCIA SCSI devices. If Setup tried to
install Windows NT on the PCMCIA drive, the installation would succeed, but
Windows NT would not be bootable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the controller after you have installed Windows NT.
