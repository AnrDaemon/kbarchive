PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform repetitive reads and writes to your floppy disk on a MIPS
computer, the STOP Message appears:

   STOP: 0x0000003F 0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000)
   NO_MORE_SYSTEMS_PTES

CAUSE
=====

During repetitive floppy disk I/O, the Memory Descriptor List (MDL) becomes
corrupted and supplies erroneous information leading Windows NT to believe that
no more Page Table Entries (PTES) exist.


NOTE: You can observe the decrease in PTES on the system during the floppy disk
I/O by monitoring the counter "Free System Page Table Entries" for the Memory
object in Performance Monitor.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
