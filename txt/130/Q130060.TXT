SUMMARY
=======

PRNTSCRN.COM is a terminate-stay-resident (TSR) MS-DOS program used to select
and copy screen information from an application that is not based on Windows to
the Windows Clipboard. PRNTSCRN.COM also performs automatic conversion from the
MS-DOS DBCS code page to the Big-5 code page.

CONVERT.COM is an MS-DOS program that converts a DBCS text file from one DBCS
code page to another. See the manual of Chinese Windows version 3.1 SDKE for
information about the functions provided in OEM_BIG5.DLL, a Windows Dynamic Link
Library (DLL) that contains functions to convert characters, strings, or buffers
from Big-5 to another DBCS code page, and vice versa.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The prntscrn utility is contained in a single MS-DOS executable file named
PRNTSCRN.COM. Note that prntscrn is an MS-DOS program, not a Windows program.
When first invoked from the MS-DOS command line, prntscrn installs itself as a
terminate-stay-resident (TSR) program. Subsequent invocation is via either the
CTRL+SHIFT+INSERT (full-screen) or CTRL+INSERT (selected block) key
combinations.

Prntscrn copies text from MS-DOS screens to the Windows Clipboard, with two
important additional features: Automatic conversion from the user's DBCS MS- DOS
code page to the Windows Big-5 code page.

Prntscrn works only in text mode, English or Chinese. It must be able to
differentiate graphics mode from Chinese systems' text modes. If invoked when
the screen is in graphics mode, Prntscrn ignores the invocation keystroke and
passes it on. Prntscrn works with Windows running in Standard or Enhanced modes.
It can load either before or after Windows loads.
