SUMMARY
=======

If you plan on distributing icon (.ICO) files with an application, be aware that
you must allow for icons that are properly formatted for multiple display types
and resolutions. This is easy to accomplish through the Imagedit resource editor
shipped with Visual FoxPro.

Every .ICO or .CUR file you distribute should contain images for both VGA color
and monochrome, in a 32 x 32 pixels size.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An .ICO or .CUR (cursor) file can contain multiple images. At run-time, the
operating system determines which image is appropriate for the display type
installed on the current system, and automatically selects the proper image from
the file.

To create a new icon or cursor file:

1. Start Imagedit from the Visual FoxPro program group icon or by typing Run /n
   Imagedit in the Command window. A target device dialog box appears.

2. Select a target device, and click OK.

3. Create an icon or cursor by using the drawing tools.

4. Use the dotted box icon to draw a marquee around the image created in step 3.
   Choose Copy from the Edit menu.

5. From the Edit menu, choose New Image, and choose a target device from the
   dialog box.

6. From the Edit menu, choose Paste to copy the image from the first device into
   the new target device.

7. Save the file. The icon or cursor is now ready to be used in your Visual
   FoxPro application.
