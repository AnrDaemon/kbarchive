SYMPTOMS
========

Error number 1728, "Color Scheme is Reserved." is now generated if any attempt

Visual FoxPro now reserves Color Scheme 15. Prior versions of FoxPro for Windows
and FoxPro for MS-DOS only reserved Color Schemes 13 and 14.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Any current programs that make use of color scheme 15 must be modified to use
another color scheme. There are 24 color schemes in Microsoft FoxPro products.
Schemes 13-15 are reserved in Visual FoxPro and schemes 13-16 are reserved in
