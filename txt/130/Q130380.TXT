SUMMARY
=======

In Visual FoxPro version 3.0, when you create a custom property in the form
designer, there is no place to specify the value for the custom property. You
can, however, specify the custom property name and description in the custom
property dialog box.

When you finish creating the custom property name, before you can see it, you
need to make sure you are selecting the top-most container, which depends on
whether are you creating a Form or a Formset. When you select the top-most
container, you can see the newly created custom property name at the bottom of
the Other or All tab in the properties sheet. Then you can set the value there.
That value becomes the default value when the property is used.
