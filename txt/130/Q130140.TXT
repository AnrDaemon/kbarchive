TITLE   :FIX: SourceSafe Might Not Get Long Filenames on Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:3.10
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400fix kbSSafe300bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SourceSafe might not retrieve long filenames correctly on a computer running
Windows NT even if the long filenames option is checked from the GUI and the
LONG_FILENAMES variable is added to one of the .INI files.

CAUSE
=====

SourceSafe for Windows NT supports long filenames only if the drive is a mounted
NTFS drive. Even though Windows NT FAT drives support long filenames, SourceSafe
for Windows NT writes the file as an 8.3 filename.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
This bug was corrected in Visual SourceSafe version 4.0.
