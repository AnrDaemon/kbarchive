SYMPTOMS
========

Each time you start Program Manager in Windows 95, the Program Manager window
opens noticeably higher on the screen and eventually moves itself off the
screen.

This problem occurs when the taskbar is positioned at the top of the screen and
you have enabled the Always On Top option and disabled the Auto Hide option for
the taskbar.

RESOLUTION

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Move the taskbar to another position on the screen and move the Program
   Manager window lower on the screen before you quit close it.

 - Disable the taskbar's Always On Top option, or enable its Auto Hide option.
   To access these options, click the taskbar with the right mouse button, then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

STATUS
======
