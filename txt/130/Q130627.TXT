The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a

SYMPTOMS
========

After you perform a quick format on an unformatted floppy disk in Windows NT
File Manager or MS-DOS Command Prompt, the following error message appears when
you copy large files to the floppy disk:

   No ID address mark was found on the floppy disk.

CAUSE
=====

This is expected behavior. When you quick format an unformatted floppy disk,
correct data structures are placed; however, no media test and verification of
cluster usability are performed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, perform the normal format on an unformatted floppy
disk.
