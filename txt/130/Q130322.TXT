SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks uses data encryption technology to provide
security on many of the data files found in the postoffice database. Examples of
the files that are encrypted are all .MAI, .ATT, .CAL, and .MMF files, as well
as password fields in the MASTER.GLB and ACCESS.GLB files. Encrypting these
files prevents anyone from dumping their contents and openly viewing the
information contained in the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The data encryption algorithm employed by Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, while
being proprietary, is NSA (National Security Agency) approved.

Microsoft Mails data encryption technique is similar to the Data Encryption
Standard (DES) as designed by the National Bureau of Standards; however, unlike
DES, the data encryption technology employed by Microsoft Mail is exportable
outside the United States.
