TITLE   :Mouse Connected to Disabled COM Port Functions Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience either of the following situations:

 - Although the current hardware profile indicates that the PS/2-style or serial
   port to which the mouse is attached is disabled, the mouse functions
   properly.

 - Although the current hardware profile indicates that a particular serial port
   is disabled, you can communicate with that port from an MS-DOS prompt.

CAUSE
=====

When you start Windows 95 with a hardware profile in which the port that the
mouse is connected to is disabled, the Windows 95 mouse driver searches all the
appropriate ports for a mouse. If the driver locates a mouse, the driver loads
and the mouse works correctly.

Similarly, accessing a serial port from an MS-DOS prompt bypasses the virtual
communications driver, accessing the port directly. Therefore, you can
communicate with the port even if it is disabled in Device Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not want to use a mouse in Windows 95, remove the mouse in Device
Manager and then disconnect the mouse from the computer.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
