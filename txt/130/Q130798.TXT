======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running an application, if FoxPro or Visual FoxPro is minimized and then
maximized, a "File <filename> Does Not Exist" error occurs when you run a
program from the menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

If a READ is in effect at the time FoxPro is minimized, the error does not
occur. The READ may be in effect either through a Foundation READ implemented in
the menu or after the menu has been displayed, as in the READ CYCLE described in
Step 6 below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create an application that has these components:

   a. With a menu as the MAIN component, create a single menu option ("Do
      Program") as a COMMAND "DO xtest.prg."

   b. In the XTEST.PRG, add this code:

         WAIT WINDOW "okay"

2. Build the application.

3. Delete or rename the following source files: XTEST.PRG and XTEST.FXP.

4. Run the application, and click "Do Program." The wait window should be
   displayed.

5. Minimize FoxPro, and then maximize it. Click "Do Program." The wait window is
   not displayed in Visual FoxPro, and an error occurs. In Visual FoxPro for
   Macintosh, switch to Finder and then back to FoxPro.

6. Clear the error. In the Command window, issue these commands:

      DO xtest.app
      @1,1 GET mvar DEFAULT SPACE(5)
      READ CYCLE

7. Minimize FoxPro, and then maximize it. Click "Do Program." The wait window is
   displayed correctly. In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, switch to Finder and
   then back to FoxPro.
