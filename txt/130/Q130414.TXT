TITLE   :PRB: "Member Column<n> is a class member" Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the ColumnCount property of a grid class, subclassed onto a form, to a
value less than the one already set for the grid class when it was created
results in this error:

   Member COLUMN<n> is a class member.

CAUSE
=====

You cannot delete members from an instantiated object that are members of the
base class.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert a Grid class into a form, you cannot change the ColumnCount
property to a value less than the one that was set when the Grid class was
created. If you do so, the "Member COLUMN<n> is a class member" error
message is displayed. In this error, <n> is a number that is one greater
than the ColumnCount value you are trying to set for the Grid class in the
form.

For example if ColumnCount for the Grid class was set to 3 when it was created,
and you change it to 2, 1, or 0 when placed in a form, then the value of
<n> in the error message will be 3, 2, or 1 respectively.


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Grid class with three columns.

2. Create a form.

3. Drop an instance of the Grid class onto the form, and populate the
   three-column grid.

4. Save and run the form. Everything works as expected.

5. Modify the form.

6. Change ColumnCount for the grid to 2. The error "Member COLUMN3 is a class
   member" is displayed.

NOTE: If the ColumnCount is changed to 1, the error message is "Member COLUMN2 is
a class member."
