TITLE   :Printing Through HPMON(DLC) May Cause Print Subsystem to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The system displays a dialog box containing the following message when you print
to a network printer attached to the network through HPMON:

   Spoolss.exe
   The driver \driver\dlc failed to complete an i/o request in the allotted time.

While the dialog is displayed, the print subsystem (SPOOLSS) and all applications
interacting with it are locked up, until the dialog is cleared when you select
OK.

CAUSE
=====

On a Windows NT system with a large amount of DLC traffic, the thread writing
data to a network attached printer may time-out while waiting for the I-frame to
be transmitted. After timing out, the thread exits and in the thread termination
processing, the system finds and cancels all outstanding I/O requests for this
thread. A dialog box containing information regarding the failing driver is then
displayed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
