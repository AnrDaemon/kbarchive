PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run WINNT.EXE and SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) is loaded to cache reads and
writes to drive A, and you follow the Setup prompts, the first floppy disk is
removed before MS-DOS has finished writing to the floppy disk. This results in
various problems and the wrong files being written to the setup disks.

CAUSE
=====

The cached data is not flushed to the floppy disk before you are prompted to
change floppy disks.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.

Additional query words: prodnt 3.51
