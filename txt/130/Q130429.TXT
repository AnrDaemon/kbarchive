The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An appointment less than 5 minutes in length may be difficult to see in the
Planner view.

If an appointment is scheduled for one minute, it appears as normal in the
Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views. However, it is very difficult to see in
the Planner view. If you set the Appointment Book time scale to a 30 or 60
minute increment, the appointment is almost invisible in the Planner.

In the Planner view, each appointment is displayed to scale. Therefore, if
you use a large time scale to view an entry scheduled for less than 5
minutes, it may be difficult to see.

Additional query words: schedule plus 7.00
