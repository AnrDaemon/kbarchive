SUMMARY
=======

FONTINST is a sample application in the Microsoft Software Library that
demonstrates how to programmatically add a TrueType, raster, or vector font to
the system.

When working with a TrueType font file (.ttf file), FONTINST creates a .fot file
and moves the specified .ttf file to the Windows system directory. For a raster
or vector font file (.fon file), FONTINST moves the .fon file to the Windows
system directory. After the font file has been moved to the system directory,
FONTINST adds the font to the system by using the AddFontResource() API. Then it
adds font information to the [fonts] section of the Win.ini file so that the
font is automatically loaded every time Windows starts. For example, the
following line is added to the Win.ini file when FONTINST adds the Arial.ttf
file to the system:

      Arial (TrueType)=ARIAL.FOT

FONTINST also demonstrates how to retrieve the facename of a font given a .ttf or
.fon file. In the case of a TrueType font, FONTINST opens up the file and reads
the naming table of the .ttf file. FONTINST also shows how to read the FONTINFO
structure (as described on pages 49-50 of the "Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit: Programmer's Reference, Volume 4: Resources") of a .fon file.
The facename of a font in a .fon file can also be found in this manner.

After a font is installed by FONTINST, information about the font is displayed in
the window. Information such as the TEXTMETRIC structure and font type, as well
as sample font text, is displayed. Information added to the Win.ini file is also
displayed in this window.
