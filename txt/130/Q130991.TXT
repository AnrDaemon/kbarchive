SUMMARY
=======

A file created with the command REPORT FORM formname TO FILE filename will
create a file with printer codes. This file can be printed with this MS-DOS
command:

      RUN COPY /b filename LPT1:

MORE INFORMATION
================

A file created with printer codes cannot be printed using the TYPE command or by
choosing Print from the File menu. These two methods expect a text file with no
printer codes. Using either of these two methods prints the file with lots of
strange looking characters that are the printer control codes.

The /b in the above command stands for binary. Print files created by the REPORT
FORM command are graphic files, not text files and must be printed as a binary
file not as a text file. The /b command can only be used with the MS-DOS COPY
command.
