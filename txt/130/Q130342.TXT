TITLE   :PRB: Selecting Cancel Cancels User Code But Not Form Execution
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The form runs and appears even though you clicked Cancel in the Program Error
dialog box. The form and all objects are not removed from memory.

CAUSE
=====

The Cancel button is supposed to cancel running code only. This is by design.
The form is not code, so clicking Cancel has no affect on the form. All Cancel
is supposed to do is cancel all the procedures, methods, and events currently in
the call stack. It is aware of the existence of objects.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to kill the object upon an occurrence of a program error, you can
suspend the program, release the object, and then cancel the program.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. In the LOAD EVENT for the form, type "?MYTEST1()" (without the quotation
   marks) on one line, and "?MYTEST2()" (without the quotation marks) on the
   second line. (intentional errors)

3. Open the Debug window from the Tools menu.

4. Add _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM to the Debug window.

5. Run the Form.

6. When the program error dialog appears, click the Cancel button. Notice that
   the user-defined code in the Load method is canceled. The second line is not
   executed, but the form object is created and displayed.
