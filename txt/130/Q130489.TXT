 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compose a message and click the To button, and then choose the Send
Options button in the Select Names dialog box, the following error message is
generated:

   Per-recipient send options could not be set. If your recipient supports send
   options, you must first select the recipient name in the To, Cc or Bcc box.

   OK

CAUSE
=====

Currently, the only providers that support Send Options are the Internet and Fax
drivers. The provider is responsible for using this option, not Microsoft
Exchange.
