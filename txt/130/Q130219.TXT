TITLE   :PC WRmt: PORT COM<n> in Script Does Not Override MSMAIL.INI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select a modem script (for example, USGNERIC or USVSER96) on a port other
than COM1, and then select a modem script that has the command PORT COM<n>
to select the communications port (for example, HIGHSP11) via the Communications
dialog box with Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, Mail Remote for Windows will
still try to use the communications port selected by the previous script.

CAUSE
=====

The MSMAIL.INI still has the following entry:

   [SFSRemote]
   DefaultPort=COM<n>

where <n> was set by the script that allows a port selection.

This entry is not overridden by the command PORT COM <n> provided by the
non-selectable communications port script file.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three procedures to resolve this:

Procedure A:

   Modify the DefaultPort=COM<n> setting in the MSMAIL.INI to reflect the
   communications port the modem is now connected to.

Procedure B:

1. From the Mail menu, choose Communications. Select the USGNERIC (US-Generic
   Modem) script.

2. Change to the proper communications port, and click OK. This will write the
   changes to the MSMAIL.INI.

3. From the Mail menu, choose Communications. Select the script that does not
   have a selectable communications port option.

Procedure C:

1. Using Notepad or any text editor, edit the .MDM file (or MoDeM text file) for
   the script in question.

2. Remark out any PORT COM<n> statements in the .MDM file with a semicolon
   (;), and save the changes.

3. Using the MS-DOS RENAME command, rename the original .SCR file in the
   \WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\GLB directory to .OLD.

4. Recompile the script file using SCRCOMP.EXE.
