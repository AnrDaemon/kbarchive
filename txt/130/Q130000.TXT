SYMPTOMS
========

While you are monitoring Services for Macintosh (SFM) in Windows NT Server
Performance Monitor, the following Application log events appear in Event
Viewer:

   Event ID: 3001
   Source: ATKCTRS
   Type: Error
   Description: Unable to open ATK for R access. Returning IO
   Status Block in Data.

   Event ID: 2000
   Source SFMCTRS
   Type: Error
   Description: Unable to open driver containing SFM file server
   performance data. To view the MacFile counters from PERFMON.EXE,
   make sure the MacFile service has been started.

CAUSE
=====

These events indicate a problem with Performance Monitor not being able to
communicate with the Appletalk Protocol. These events are logged in the
Application event log while monitoring Appletalk or MacFile Server in
Performance Monitor when:

 - SFM is not installed or started.

 - The Appletalk protocol device or File SFM service is stopped.

 - You have a bad network interface card (NIC) or network cabling.

 - Macintosh seed routing is enabled in SFM with incorrect or conflicting
   parameters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two counters that performance monitor contains which allows a user to
monitor how SFM is behaving on a Windows NT server. In performance monitor, you
can select MacFile Server and Appletalk. These are represented by the
SFMCTRS.DLL and ATKCTRS.DLL files respectively.

Occasionally when viewing a event log on a Windows NT Server you may notice
events that have a source of SFMCTRS or ATKCTRS. If there are a large number of
events it could be an indication of problems with the SFM on the server.
