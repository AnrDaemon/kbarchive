SUMMARY
=======

This article lists command-line switches you can use when you start Windows
Explorer (EXPLORER.EXE).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Syntax
------

EXPLORER.EXE [/n][/e][,/root,<object>][[,/select],<sub object>]

Switches
--------

/n:  Opens a new window in single-paned (My Computer) view for each item
     selected, even if the new window duplicates a window that is
     already open.

/e:  Uses Windows Explorer view. Windows Explorer view is most similar
     to File Manager in Windows version 3.x. Note that the default view
     is Open view.

/root,<object>:  Specifies the root level of the specified view. The
                 default is to use the normal namespace root (the
                 desktop). Whatever is specified is the root for the
                 display.

/select,<sub object>:  Specifies the folder to receive the initial
                       focus. If "/select" is used, the parent folder
                       is opened and the specified object is selected.

Examples
--------

 - To open a Windows Explorer view to explore only objects on \\<server
   name>, use the following syntax:

   explorer /e,/root,\\<server name>

 - To view the C:\WINDOWS folder and select CALC.EXE, use the following syntax:

   explorer /select,c:\windows\calc.exe

Additional query words: 4.0 parameters
