TITLE   :Norton Desktop Groups Not Converted by Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade Windows version 3.x to Windows 95 and you are using Norton
Desktop for Windows, the Windows 95 Setup program does not convert Norton
Desktop groups to Windows 95 folders.

CAUSE
=====

Norton Desktop places desktop icons in Quick Access groups (.QAG files) instead
of Group (.GRP) files as Microsoft Windows 3.x does. The Windows 95 Setup
program can convert only .GRP files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To retain Norton Desktop icons when you upgrade to Windows 95, convert the
Norton Desktop groups from .QAG files to .GRP files using the conversion utility
provided by Symantec. For information about using or obtaining this utility,
please contact Symantec.

After you convert .QAG files to .GRP files, use the Windows 95 GRPCONV.EXE tool
to convert the .GRP files to Windows 95 folders. For more information about
using the GRPCONV.EXE tool, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95. For more
information about resolving this issue, please contact Symantec.
