TITLE   :Lucida Math Type 1 Fonts Do Not Print Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document that uses the Lucida New Math Symbol Type 1 or the
Lucida New Math Extensions Type 1 font under Windows NT, the glyphs in the 80-9f
range are not converted correctly to TrueType fonts because the printed symbols
are different from the original Type 1 font symbols.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT font converter does not map characters correctly when a fonts
contain special symbols not usually found in regular fonts. The glyphs that
should have printed exist in the converted TrueType font, but the character map
table fails to point to them. Therefore, they are not printed correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
