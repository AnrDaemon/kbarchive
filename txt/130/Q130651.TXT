TITLE   :PC-NFS and Client for Microsoft Networks Cannot Connect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet msnets win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows 95 computer running SunSoft's PC-NFS version 5.x and the Microsoft
Client for Microsoft Networks may not be able to see shared resources on a
PC-NFS server or an SMB server running the NetBEUI protocol.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a conflict between the NDISHLP.SYS driver used by
VREDIR and the PCNFS.SYS driver supplied by SunSoft for their PC-NFS client. The
conflict causes network packets to be forwarded incorrectly, so no packets are
broadcast on the network.

This problem affects only certain PCMCIA and Cabletron network adapters. The
following network adapters are known to exhibit this behavior:

 - Xircom PCMCIA network adapters

 - IBM Ethernet PCMCIA network adapters

 - Cabletron Ethernet network adapters


STATUS
======

We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
