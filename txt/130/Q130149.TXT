SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a Microsoft Word 7.x for Windows document in Microsoft Word 97 in
the Word 6.0/95 format, you may receive the following error message:

   There is not enough memory or disk space to convert this document.

CAUSE
=====

The List Separator on the Number tab of Regional Settings (Control Panel) is set
to a semicolon. When the list separator is a semicolon, the Microsoft Word 97
converter does not save the document correctly.

NOTE: The semicolon is most often used as a list separator in International
versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 2
(SR-2).

To temporarily work around this problem, use something other than a semicolon for
the list separator within the Regional Settings. To do this, follow these
steps:

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please consult your product
documentation to complete these steps.

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Regional Settings (in Microsoft Windows 2000, double-click
   Regional Options) and then click the Number tab.

3. Change the List Separator to something other than a semicolon. For example,
   change the separator to a comma.

4. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 2 (SR-2).
