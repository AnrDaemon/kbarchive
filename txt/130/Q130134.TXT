The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to copy the Seneca Town to the Windows Clipboard using the 500
Nations menu options, the Huron Village appears instead of the Seneca Town.

WORKAROUND
==========

An alternate method exists to capture the correct picture and paste the picture
into Microsoft Paintbrush. In Paintbrush, the image can be cropped, sized,
printed, or imported into other programs.

With Seneca Town on your screen, copy the entire screen to the Clipboard by
pressing and holding down the ALT key while you press and release the PRINT
SCREEN key (ALT+PRINT SCREEN).


To paste the entire captured image from the Clipboard into Paintbrush, do the
following:

1. Start Microsoft Paintbrush, usually located in the Accessories program group.

2. From the Options menu, choose Image Attributes. Select Default and choose OK.

3. From the View menu, choose Zoom Out.

4. From the Edit menu, choose Paste. A grid appears.

5. From the Edit menu, choose Paste again. The picture reappears under the grid.

6. From the View menu, choose View Picture to verify that the entire image has
   been pasted. Click the picture anywhere to return to the previous view.

7. From the View menu, choose Zoom In.

The entire image is pasted into the Paintbrush work area.

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in 500 Nations. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
