TITLE   :How to Install OS/2 1.3x System Management Server Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup smshowto

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft System Management Server does not properly install files on OS/2 1.3x
clients. When the client files are not correctly installed, the OS/2 client is
not properly inventoried.

CAUSE
=====

System Management Server uses the SMSLS.CMD file to install files to OS/2 client
computers. SMSLS.CMD determines whether a file named MDOS is located in the
client's %COMSPEC% directory. If the file is not present, the client files are
not installed.

NOTE: The MDOS file is shipped with the IBM Windows for OS/2 product. The
%COMSPEC% directory is defined by the %COMSPEC% system variable on the client
computer. To determine %COMSPEC% directory, type "SET" (without the quotation
marks) at a command prompt.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the MDOS file is not present, create a MDOS file of 0 bytes length and place
it in the %COMSPEC% directory. This will allow Systems Management Server to
install the client files correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in System Management Server 1.0.
This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version 1.1.
