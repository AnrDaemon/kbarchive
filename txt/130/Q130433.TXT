SYMPTOMS
========

You can add a secondary time zone by choosing Options on the Tools menu and
clicking the Time Zone tab. This will allow you to view your schedule as someone
in another time zone would.

When you add a secondary time zone, the default is Pacific Time. It will not
default to the Primary Time Zone setting.

CAUSE
=====

Defaulting to Pacific Time is by design.

Additional query words: schedule plus 7.00
