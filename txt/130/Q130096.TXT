======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, under
certain conditions, you may receive the following error message when you log
into the postoffice:

   This account is not a valid user of this message file

CAUSE
=====

The criteria contained in the Mail Message File (MMF) does not match your
information on the postoffice. When this message is seen, it indicates that you
are being properly validated by the postoffice, and the information returned
from the postoffice does not match what is in the MMF.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Move the original .MMF to a new location.

2. Log in, and create a new .MMF.

3. From the File menu, choose Import. Point to the original .MMF that you moved.
   It will then ask you for the .MMF password, at which point you type in the
   original password to unlock the .MMF file. You can then import the old
   information into the new MMF.

4. Use the MS-DOS client to log into the postoffice, and change the user's
   password to the old password (the .MMFs password).

5. Log in to Mail using the Windows client. The password can now be changed from
   the Windows client without problems.
