TITLE   :Frame Corruption in Retransmitted IPX Packet
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT IPX/SPX Compatible Transport protocol (NWLink),
frame corruption may occur. This results in a lost connection between a client
and a server. A network trace reveals that the IPX packet is corrupt (which is
why the client does not receive the data). This problem can occur on both
Ethernet and Token Ring networks.

The following conditions must exist for the problem to occur:

 - The Windows NT server is running NWLink IPX.

 - The client sends a request to Windows NT server and the server responds.

 - The original frame gets lost on the network.

A slow WAN may be more prone to encounter this problem because they often drop
frames. The problem only occurs during frame re-transmission.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51 or the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows
NT version 3.50.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5 and in Windows NT 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
