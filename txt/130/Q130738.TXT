TITLE   :Persistent NetWare Connections Unavailable After Upgrading
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51, persistent NetWare connections are
not available in File Manager. When you run NET USE from an MS-DOS Command
Prompt, the NetWare connections appear as Unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

When you use Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW) or Client Service for NetWare
(CSNW) in Windows NT version 3.5, the provider name for the NetWare network is
NetWare Network. In Windows NT version 3.51, the NetWare network provider name
has changed to NetWare Or Compatible Network. The provider name is stored in the
user profile which precludes us from making the needed changes to allow the
connections to carry over to the new version.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, remove the previous persistent connections and
re-establish the connections again in Windows NT version 3.51.
