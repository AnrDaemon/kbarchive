The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Golf 2.0 for Windows, you may receive the following
error message:

   Crucial Files Missing

CAUSE
=====

This message occurs because the player profile setting does not recognize any
extended keyboard characters or any foreign keyboard characters.

Setup allows use of extended characters (for example foreign accent marks) during
initial setup, but after setup they cause the above error message because player
profile doesn't recognize extended characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, you must obtain a new set of Golf disks, delete your
Golf directory, and reinstall the program without using extended characters in
the name fields. For more information about how to perform these tasks in
Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

To obtain new or updated Microsoft products, call the Microsoft Sales Information

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Golf version 2.0 for Windows.
