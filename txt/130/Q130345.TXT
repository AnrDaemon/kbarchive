-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro introduces several database properties available to databases.
These properties include comments and stored procedures. This article describes
how to determine database properties from a Visual FoxPro program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DISPLAY DATABASE and LIST DATABASE commands can view several database
properties at once. These commands can direct output to the console, to a
printer, or to a text file. The example in this article retrieves individual
components of a database.

Comment
-------

A database comment can be obtained by using the DBGETPROP() function. The
following example shows how to return the comment of a database by using
DBGETPROP():

      cResult=DBGETPROP('mydata', 'DATABASE', 'Comment')

The parameters are:

 - mydata is the table name.

 - DATABASE specifies that the property is a database property.

 - Comment is the property desired.

Version
-------

The version number of a database can be obtained by using DBGETPROP() function.
The following example shows how to return the version number of a database by
using DBGETPROP():

      cResult=DBGETPROP('mydata', 'DATABASE', 'Version')

The parameters are:

 - mydata is the table name.

 - DATABASE specifies that the property is a database property.

 - Version is the property desired.

Path
----

The path to the database can be obtained by using the DBC() function. The
following example shows how to return the path of a database by using DBC():

      SET DATABASE TO alldata        &&Assumes a database named "alldata"
      cResult=DBC()

Stored Procedures
-----------------

Stored procedures contained within a database can be obtained by using the
DISPLAY PROCEDURES or COPY PROCEDURES command. There is no way to store the
contents of stored procedures in a memory variable. DISPLAY and COPY PROCEDURES
can both be used to copy stored procedures to a text file or to the printer. The
following example uses COPY PROCEDURES to copy the stored procedures to a file
named STORCODE.TXT:

      OPEN DATABASE alldata
      COPY PROCEDURES TO storcode.txt

Tables
------

A list of tables contained within a database can be obtained by using the DISPLAY
TABLES or LIST TABLES command to display the list to the console, a printer, or
a text file. Here's an example:

      OPEN DATABASE alldata
      LIST TABLES TO FILE tblfile.txt NOCONSOLE

Views
-----

A list of views contained within a database can be obtained by using the DISPLAY
VIEWS or LIST VIEWS command to display the list to the console, a printer, or a
text file. Here's an example:

      OPEN DATABASE alldata
      LIST VIEWS TO FILE viewfile.txt NOCONSOLE

Named Connections
-----------------

A list of named connections contained within a database can be obtained by using
the DISPLAY CONNECTIONS or LIST CONNECTIONS command to display the list to the
console, a printer, or a text file. Here's an example:

      OPEN DATABASE alldata
      LIST CONNECTIONS TO FILE connfile.txt NOCONSOLE
