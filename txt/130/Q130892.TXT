TITLE   :File Auditing Error in Windows NT 3.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting file auditing fails in Windows NT when you:

1. Run User Manager and turn on auditing.

2. Create a directory on a Windows NT file system (NTFS) partition.

3. Create four or more subdirectories underneath the original directory.

4. Select the third directory and deny access to everyone.

5. Select the original directory and choose Auditing from the Security menu.

6. Select Replace Auditing on Subdirectories, select Replace Auditing on
   Existing Files, and select any events to audit.

7. Choose the Add button and then add Administrator.

8. Choose OK to begin auditing the directories.

9. You choose Yes when the "Access denied. Do you wish to continue?" error
   message appears.

If you select any directory past the third directory to see if auditing has been
turned on, you see that it has not.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in ACLEDIT.DLL that causes auditing to STOP when access is
denied while setting auditing on directories.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually choose the directories to be audited.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server version 3.5. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT Workstation
and Windows NT Server version 3.51.
