TITLE   :NetBIOS Parameter Ignored in Windows NT Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows NT Mail (MSMAIL32.EXE) ignores NetBIOS notification of new
mail delivery.

The Windows NT 3.5 Resource Guide Volume 1 incorrectly states, on page 579, that
Windows NT Mail will use NetBIOS notification for new mail delivery if you add
the following registry entry:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail\NetBIOS

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NetBIOS parameter allows a sending station to send a directed datagram (a
NetBIOS notification) to another station. The datagram arrives at the
destination computer to tell Microsoft Mail that a new mail message was sent to
the computer. The Mail program on the destination computer can then check the
workgroup postoffice for the new mail message, thereby bypassing the
PollingInterval registry entry.

The 16-bit Windows for Workgroups mail client (MAIL.EXE) supports NetBIOS
notification of new mail delivery; the 32-bit Windows NT mail client
(MSMAIL32.EXE) does not.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem either:

 - Use the 16-bit mail client that ships with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
   version 3.2. This mail client supports NetBIOS notification of new mail
   delivery

   -or-

 - Force Microsoft Mail to check for new messages more frequently by lowering
   the PollingInterval registry entry.

See page 581, Volume 1 of the Windows NT Resource Guide for additional
information.
