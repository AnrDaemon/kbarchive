The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5

SUMMARY
=======

While Visual FoxPro has the ability to import a number of different file
formats, it is not possible to import a Microsoft Access database directly into
Visual FoxPro. You must use ODBC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The structure of a Microsoft Access database is substantially different from
something like a text file or an Excel spreadsheet. The .MDB file of a Microsoft
Access database is a container that holds the tables, forms, and reports for use
by Microsoft Access. The manner in which the data is stored is somewhat the same
as the way it is stored in an SQL Server database where you must first access
the database itself to gain access to the tables.

Because Visual FoxPro does not understand the format and structure of the
Microsoft Access database, you cannot import data directly from a Microsoft
Access database by using the Import Wizard.

To import the data, you need to use ODBC to pull data from the Microsoft Access
tables. To learn how to use ODBC with Microsoft Access tables, please see the
"Access data, using in Visual FoxPro" topic in the Visual FoxPro Help file.
