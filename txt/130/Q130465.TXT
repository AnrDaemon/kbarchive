The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b

SUMMARY
=======

When a connection is made to a SQL Server data source, the database in use will
be:

 - The one specified in the data source.

   -or-

 - The default database as defined on the server - if there isn't one specified
   in the data source,

The database in use can be changed by using ODBC and executing a USE command
within the SQLEXEC() function. Or if you're using FoxPro version 2.x for
Windows, you can use the DBEXEC() function.

The initial database in use can be specified in the data source by going into the
setup of the data source, clicking the Options button, and typing in the name of
the database in the "Database Name" area.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assuming a connection exists to a SQL Server data source, the database in use
can be changed by executing the following function:

      success = SQLEXEC(handle,"USE <desired database name>")

This cannot be used reliably with Remote Views created from saved Connections
because there is no reliable way to determine the connection handle obtained
from the DataSource or a saved Connection. To connect to a DataSource and obtain
a handle number, use the SQLConnect()function in Visual FoxPro or the
DBConnect() function in FoxPro version 2.x for Windows.
