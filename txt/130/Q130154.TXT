PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,4.0,4.0a,4.0c,7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbole kbdta

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft Project for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you insert a Microsoft Project Gantt chart into PowerPoint, beginning and
ending columns or rows may be missing. If you resize the object or try inserting
the same object again, the results are the same.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Project can only copy to the Clipboard the information in the current
window. Therefore, if more than one screen of information is selected, only the
information on the screen at the time the Copy command is executed is copied to
the Clipboard.

WORKAROUND
==========

Reduce the total size of the Gantt chart by reducing the text size. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Project, click Text Styles on the Format menu.

2. On the Item To Change list, click All.

3. Click a smaller font size. Click OK.

Reduce the font size until the entire project is visible at once. Now if you copy
and paste the Gantt chart into a PowerPoint slide, it appears in its entirety.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
