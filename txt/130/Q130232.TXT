TITLE   :WINS Response to Group Name Query is Limited Broadcast Address

SYMPTOMS
========

If a NetBIOS application registers a group name with Windows Internet Naming
Service (WINS), it receives a positive response. However, WINS does not store a
list of addresses registering a group name. It responds to a name query on a
group name with the limited broadcast address (255.255.255.255). This may make
it impossible for a client application to discover a server application on the
network if it uses group names and is separated by a router.

CAUSE
=====

WINS was designed to perform this way, with one exception; NetBIOS names ending
in [1C]. Windows NT Domain Controllers register the <domain>[1C] name with
WINS, and a list of addresses is returned if a name query on a domain name is
sent.
