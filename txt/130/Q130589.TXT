SYMPTOMS
========

When you rename a directory on a Microsoft Windows NT server or work- station
from a Windows 95 client, you may receive the following error message:

   Error Renaming File

   Cannot rename <directory name>: Access is denied. Make sure the disk is
   not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.

-or-

   Cannot rename <directory name>: There has been a sharing violation. The
   source or destination file may be in use.

The directory is correctly renamed even though you receive this error message.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is generated if there is an open file in the directory you
are trying to rename. The server is holding on to the open file's handle, in
case the file needs to be opened again shortly. You receive an error message
because the file appears to be in use.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
