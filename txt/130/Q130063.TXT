SUMMARY
=======

EM_SETPASSWORDCHAR is enabled to use with DBCS characters. It displays two
PASSWORD characters when one DBCS character is entered. For example, when the
user enters one DBCS character, it displays two PASSWORD characters; if the user
enters two DBCS characters, it displays four PASSWORD characters.

This means that one DBCS character needs two WM_CHAR when using EM_PASSWORDCHAR.

However, if the user uses the IME (IME is activated status) for input DBCS
characters as personal PASSWORD strings, IME's interim-Windows are displayed
normally. IME is using the interim-Windows to convert HIRAGANA into KANJI for
the input of DBCS strings. When the IME is in this status, IME is hooking all
the messages from keyboard drivers (WM_CHAR and WM_SYSKEYxxx).
