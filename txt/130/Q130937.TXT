The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1

SUMMARY
=======

The administrator of an Systems Management Server managed network may want to
install the inventory agent service for Windows NT on Windows NT Workstations.
Systems Management Server does not provide a means to do this, and it is not a
supported feature at this time. The following steps may be used to accomplish
this. They are provided as is and are not supported by Microsoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. On Windows NT Workstation, create an SMS\HELPER.SRV\X86.BIN directory. This
   directory name is arbitrary, but it helps to be consistent with the currently
   supported methodology for domain controllers running the inventory agent
   service. The X86.BIN directory should be named appropriately for the proper
   architecture (X86.BIN, ALPHA.BIN, MIPS.BIN.)

2. From the appropriate directory on an existing Systems Management Server logon
   server, copy the INVWIN32.EXE program file into the directory created in step
   1 above.

3. From the PSSTOOLS directory on the Systems Management Server distribution CD,
   run INSTSRV.EXE. Install the service using this tool, answering the following
   questions as presented by the tool:

    - Service Name
    - User account
    - Password
    - Machine name
    - Path
    - Start Mode

4. Each time the service is started, it must include an argument containing the
   path to the logon server it will report inventory to. This is in the format
   of "/L:\\<SMSLogonServer>\SMS_SHR\" and may need to be "escaped" in
   some cases. For example, using the SMS Service Manager, the argument must
   look like /L:\\\\<SMSLogonServer>\\SMS_SHR\\. Option 4 in INSTSRV can
   be used to start the service, Control Panel <Services>, in addition to
   the Systems Management Server Service Manager.
