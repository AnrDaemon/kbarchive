The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print to a PostScript printer on the network, either of the
following problems may occur:

 - Nothing is printed.

 - You receive a general protection (GP) fault error message similar to the
   following error message:

   SPOOL32 caused a general protection fault in module ADOBEPS.DRV

CAUSE
=====

These problems can occur if you are using the Adobe PostScript printer driver
version 2.1.1. This printer driver cannot print over a network.

The Adobe PostScript printer driver version 2.1.1 appends a colon (:) to the end
of the network path before it calls OpenJob(). The colon causes the network path
to the print spooler to be invalid.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Update to a Windows 95 PostScript printer driver.

 - Print to a file, then copy the file to the network printer port. For
   information about how to do so, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
