TITLE   :DHCP Requests Not Returned by TokenRing Routers
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running Windows for Workgroups and TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups, and computers running Windows NT and TCP/IP may fail to obtain DHCP
addresses in a routed TokenRing environment. Routers functioning as a 1542 BootP
relay agents in a TokenRing environment forward the request to the DHCP server,
however when the server replies back to the client, routers (including the
Proteon CNX500 router), may fail to forward the packet due to the htype field in
the packet. Many routers do not check the htype field and forward packets
allowing the workstation to receive the servers response.

CAUSE
=====

The Hardware Type (htype) is filled out incorrectly by the client. The type
should be 6 (IEEE 802 Networks), by RFC. However, protocol analyzer traces will
show (htype) = 1 (0x1) 10 MB Ethernet even on a workstation configured with a
TokenRing network adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain and install the fix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and
TCPIP-32 for Windows for Workgroups versions 3.11 and 3.11a. This problem was
corrected in Windows NT 3.51 as well as TCPIP-32 for WFW 3.11b included on the
Windows NT 3.51 compact disc.
