TITLE   :PRB: Movable Property in Effect at Design Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Movable Property of a form is set to False (.F.) in design mode, the
form cannot be moved from its current location.

CAUSE
=====

While you are creating a form with the Form Designer, the form is considered
"live." This means that visual and behavioral changes are reflected immediately
in the design mode of the form as well as during run time.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add all the controls for the form first before setting the properties that will
control the behavior of the form.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps illustrate the effects of setting the Movable property for
the form in design mode.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Set the Movable property to .F..

3. Try to move the form while in design mode.
