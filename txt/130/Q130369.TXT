-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows 95, you may experience problems with the visibility of
certain screen elements (such as selected commands on a menu).

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 inherits the color scheme from the previous version of Windows.
However, the default menu color is changed to gray (instead of white). If the
previous color scheme uses gray as the color for selected menu items, there is
no difference in appearance between selected and non-selected items on a menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this situation, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the desktop and then click Properties on
   the menu that appears.

2. Click the Appearance tab.

3. Click a scheme in the Color Scheme box, or click Selected Items in the Item
   box and then click another color.

4. Click OK.
