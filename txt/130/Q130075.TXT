TITLE   :TEMP Environment Variable Overwritten in Command Prompt
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The TEMP environment variable is set to a series of Xs in an MS-DOS virtual
machine (or command prompt).

CAUSE
=====

If the MS-DOS TEMP environment variable is set to a directory that does not
exist, Windows 95 automatically overwrites the variable with a series of Xs.


RESOLUTION
==========

To make sure that the TEMP environment variable is valid, use any one of the
following methods:

 - Remove the SET TEMP statement from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

 - Create the directory that the TEMP environment variable points to.

 - Change the SET TEMP statement to point to a directory that exists.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
