The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK), version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Win32s version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Because of the variety of computer manufacturers (NEC, Fujitsu, IBMJ, and so on)
in Japan, sometimes Windows-based applications need to know which OEM (original
equipment manufacturer) manufactured the computer that is running the
application. This article explains how.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no documented way to detect the manufacturer of the computer that is
currently running an application. However, a Windows-based application can
detect the type of OEM Windows by using the return value of the
GetKeyboardType() function.

If an application uses the GetKeyboardType API, it can get OEM ID by specifying
"1" (keyboard subtype) as argument of the function. Each OEM ID is listed here:

   OEM Windows       OEM ID
   ------------------------------
   Microsoft         00H (DOS/V)
   all AX            01H
   EPSON             04H
   Fujitsu           05H
   IBMJ              07H
   Matsushita        0AH
   NEC               0DH
   Toshiba           12H

Application programs can use these OEM IDs to distinguish the type of OEM
Windows. Note, however, that this method is not documented, so Microsoft may not
support it in the future version of Windows.

As a rule, application developers should write hardware-independent code,
especially when making Windows-based applications. If they need to make a
hardware-dependent application, they must prepare the separated program file for
each different hardware architecture.
