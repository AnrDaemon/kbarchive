TITLE   :Windows NT 3.5 SNMP Agent Responds to Incorrect Communities
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNMP managers can get information from Windows NT 3.5 SNMP agents only if the
community name of the SNMP manager matches the community name of the SNMP agent,
or if the community name of the SNMP manager is empty (no community name).
However, if an SNMP agent matches the first part of the name sent from the SNMP
manager, the SNMP agent incorrectly accepts the SNMP request.

For example, if the community name of the agent and manager are public and
public12345 respectively, the SNMP agent incorrectly accepts and responds to the
SNMP request.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0.
