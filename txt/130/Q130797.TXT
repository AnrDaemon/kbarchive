SUMMARY
=======

When you have both the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks and the Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks installed, you cannot specify different default
logon names for the two servers you want to log on to. The logon name that is
used for the primary network client is always used as the default logon name for
the secondary network client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you have both the Microsoft Networks and the NetWare Networks clients
installed, the number of logon dialog boxes you are presented with depends on
the organization of your logon passwords. If your Windows 95, Windows NT, and
NetWare passwords are the same, you are presented with only one logon dialog box
when you start Windows 95. If your Windows 95 and Windows NT passwords are the
same, but your NetWare password is different, you are presented with two logon
dialog boxes.

You cannot avoid multiple logon dialog boxes if any two of your logon names are
different. Because there is no way to specify different default logon names for
the Microsoft Networks and the NetWare Networks clients, you must manually
change the logon name for the secondary network client in the logon dialog box
for that client.
