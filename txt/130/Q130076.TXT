TITLE   :Briefcase Cannot Contain More Than 1.44 MB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you move a Briefcase that is larger than 1.44 MB to floppy disks, the files
that are copied to the second and subsequent disks are not maintained as
belonging to the Briefcase on the first disk. The files on the first disk can be
synchronized later, but the files on the second and subsequent disks cannot.

CAUSE
=====

There is not enough space on the first disk to store the Briefcase database.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Reduce the amount of files in the Briefcase so that the total size of all the
   files is no greater than 1.44 MB.

 - Store the files in multiple Briefcases. The total size of the files in each
   Briefcase should not exceed 1.44 MB.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
