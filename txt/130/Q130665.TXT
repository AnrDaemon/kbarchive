TITLE   :PRB: "<arrayname> is not an array" Error When Creating Array
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Commands and functions that create arrays fail if the array name is identical to
a variable name. This error message is displayed:

   '<arrayname>' is not an array.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use either of the following workarounds:

 - Dimension the array prior to referencing it. If a variable with the same name
   already exists, dimensioning the array will overwrite the variable

-or-

 - Eliminate the possibility of a conflict with a variable name by using naming
   conventions. For example preface all arrays with la (local array) and all
   variables with lv (local variable).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
