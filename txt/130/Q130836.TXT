SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Windows NT domain environment, it is not possible to view a
list of all currently validated users logged into a domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can run Server Manager and choose Show Domain Members Only from the View
Menu to view a list of computers running Windows NT that are members of the
selected domain. This is a list of computer accounts and is not an indication if
the computer is running or has been validated by its primary domain.

If Show Domain Members is not selected, browsing information is incorporated into
the list of computers. Domain member computers that are active will have a
non-gray computer icon along with the version number of Windows NT. Windows For
Workgroup computers that are using the domain name for their workgroup name will
also be added to the list when they are active, and removed from the list when
they are inactive. This does not indicate if the computer has been validated by
the domain.
