-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks attachments that are sent from simple Messaging
Application Program Interface (MAPI) applications should retain the three letter
file name extension as described in the Microsoft Windows 3.x registry database.
If the three letter file name extension is not maintained, the application will
not be launched correctly by accessing the icon associated with the object in
the Microsoft Mail for Windows. Examples of these extensions include .DOC (Word
documents), .WKS (Excel worksheet), and .WRI (Write document).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the three letter file name extension is not maintained in the code for the
MapiFile.FileName field (for Microsoft Visual Basic) in the MapiFile structure,
the following error will be returned from the Windows client:

   No application is associated with the attached file FILENAME.EXT.
   Use the File Manager to create an association.

This error will occur even if Mail appears to display the application's icon that
the file belongs to correctly. This information will appear correctly because
the information for the icon object is in the system attachment WINMAIL.DAT.
However, Mail does not use WINMAIL.DAT to launch the application associated with
the file. Instead, Mail uses the standard associations found in the Windows 3.x
registry database.

NOTE: MapiFileDesc is the equivalence of MapiFile in C.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.20 file extension
