SUMMARY
=======

When writing an installation script for a Windows-based application, an entry to
the StartUp program group should be added. However, international retail
versions of Windows use different group names. For example, the German retail
version of Windows calls its startup program group AutoStart, so merely looking
for a program group by name will not work in other languages. This article gives
you a language-independent way to update the startup group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The program manager checks for the startup group name by first checking the
PROGMAN.INI file for the entry "Startup=" entry. (The user can specify their own
startup group using this entry.) If it doesn't find this entry, it searches the
title bars of all child windows for text matching the name of the startup group
as defined in the Program Manager resource script file. In other words, there is
no tag on a program group that marks it as the startup group. It is decided
solely on the name of the group, and the name changes for each language version
of Windows.

You can use the same approach in your application. All you need to know are the
translations for "Start Up" for the languages you are interested in. Then use
code similar to this:

       #if language == GERMAN
         startup="Autostart"
      #elif language ==  ENGLISH
         startup="Start Up"
      #elif .........
