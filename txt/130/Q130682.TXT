SUMMARY
=======

In the current release of Systems Management Server, you must hand-tailor the
Windows for Workgroups setup script file (SETUP.SHH) for each type of network
card and protocol configuration used on network clients. A separate SETUP.SHH
has to be created for each configuration.

To ensure that the correct setup script file is used, the administrator must
first query for all computers with a specified network card configured a
specific way (common I/O address, IRQ setting, memory window location) and copy
these computers to a machine group. The package must be created and the file
SETUP.SHH must be replaced on each distribution server in order for the
automated setup routine to configure Windows for Workgroups correctly on the
target computers. Computers with net card configurations that do not meet the
general standards used within an organization cannot be upgraded easily.
