TITLE   :Changes Made in Control Panel System for BOOT.INI Are Ignored
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.10 3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Windows NT on a partition other than the first partition of the
hard disk, one of the following may occur:

 - The Startup Operating System list and timer in Control Panel System are
   blank.

   -or-

 - Changes made in the Control Panel System for the Startup Operating System and
   timer information are ignored when you restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

Control Panel System modifies the BOOT.INI file on the first partition of the
hard disk, even though a BOOT.INI file exists on the active partition. If a
BOOT.INI file does not exist on the first partition, the Startup Operating
System list and timer information in Control Panel System are blank.

WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this problem, do one of the following:

 - Modify the BOOT.INI file located on the active partition of the hard disk
   using a text editor.

   -or-

 - Make changes to the Startup Operating System and timer information in Control
   Panel System, and then copy the BOOT.INI file located in the first partition
   to the active partition of the hard disk.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
