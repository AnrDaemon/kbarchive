SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to install SourceSafe on a client workstation when
the data is on a network drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With SourceSafe for Windows installed on a network server, do the following on
the Windows workstation:

1. Create a directory structure on the local machine that looks like this:

   SS
   SS\USER
   SS\TEMP

2. Copy the *.EXE, *.DLL, and *.HLP files from the server's SS directory to the
   local SS directory.

3. Map the server where SourceSafe is installed to a named drive letter, such as
   Z:, making sure that the Reconnect at logon box is checked. This can be done
   using File Manager.

4. In the user's AUTOEXEC.BAT file, add this line:

   SET SSDIR=Z:\<Path to the \SS dir>

5. Edit the USERS.TXT file to change this line:

   USER_NAME=\USERS\USER_NAME\SS.INI

   to this line:

   USER_NAME=<local drive>\SS\USER\SS.INI

6. Copy the SS.INI file from the \SS\USERS\USER_NAME\ to the local \SS\USER
   directory.

7. Edit the SS\USER\SS.INI file and add the following line:

   TEMP_PATH=<local drive>:\SS\TEMP
