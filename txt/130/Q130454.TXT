======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro uses a different font (Microsoft Sans Serif) in the MS-DOS style
help file. The previous version (2.6) of FoxPro used FoxFont for the help file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FoxFont caused serious problems in localized versions. Some of the higher ASCII
number characters used in FoxFont are special symbols that map to other symbols
in the international code pages.

MS Sans Serif is the Visual FoxPro version 3.0 system font. All dialogs, wizards,
and other interface elements use MS Sans Serif. A design decision was made to
use MS Sans Serif for .DBF style Help. International code pages map well to MS
Sans Serif, so the ASCII character issue was resolved.
