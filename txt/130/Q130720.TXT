TITLE   :MS-DOS-Based Programs Do Not Use Entire Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an MS-DOS-based program in Windows 95, the program may use only the
upper two-thirds of the screen.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you are using a Cirrus Logic 6440 display adapter and
the number of lines on the screen has been changed to more than 25.

RESOLUTION
==========

Please contact Cirrus Logic for information about resolving this problem.

STATUS
======

Cirrus Logic has confirmed this to be a problem in the Cirrus Logic 6440 display
adapter BIOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you increase the number of lines on the screen to more than 25 (for example,
by using the MODE CON:LINES=43 command), the Cirrus Logic 6440 display adapter
uses only the upper two-thirds of the screen for MS-DOS- based programs.
Changing the number of lines on the screen back to 25 does not correct the
problem.
