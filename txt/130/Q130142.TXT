1. Create a directory structure that looks like this:

   \SS
   \SS\USER
   \SS\TEMP

2. Copy the SSNT.EXE and SSNT.HLP files from the server's \SS\WINNT directory.

3. Map the server where SourceSafe is installed to a named drive letter, such as
   Z:, making sure that the Reconnect at logon box is checked.

4. In the Windows NT Control Panel/System section, add the following environment
   variable:

   Variable: SSDIR Value: Z:\<path to \SS>

   USER_NAME=\USERS\USER_NAME\SS.INI

   USER_NAME=<local drive>\SS\USER\SS.INI

6. Copy the SS.INI file from the \SS\USERS\USER_NAME\ to the local \SS\USER
   directory.

7. Edit the \SS\USER\SS.INI file, and add this line:

   TEMP_PATH=\SS\TEMP
