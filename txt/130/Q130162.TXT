The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft FoxPro versions 2.5 and 2.6 for Windows provide the ADDICON.APP
application to associate icons to distributable .EXE files. However, ADDICON.APP
does not ship with Visual FoxPro version 3.0. The functionality of adding icons
to distributable .EXE files is built into the Visual FoxPro Project Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

To add an icon to a Visual FoxPro distributable .EXE file:

1. Open an existing project or create a new one.

2. From the Project menu, choose Project Info.

3. Within the Project Information dialog box, select the Attach Icon to .EXE
   check box.

4. Locate the icon file (.ICO) to attach to the executable file.

NOTE: Icon files (.ICO) may be created by using the Microsoft Image Editor
(IMAGEDIT.EXE), which ships the Professional Edition of Visual FoxPro version
3.0.
