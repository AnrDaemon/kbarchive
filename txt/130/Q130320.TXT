PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a,3.0,3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the following error
message may appear when you try to run the MOVEUSER.EXE utility to move a user
from one postoffice to another:

   Moving user '<UserName>' failed.

CAUSE
=====

A possible cause of this error is a missing or renamed MAILDATA\CAL\HEXID.CAL
file for the UserID being moved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, have the user launch Schedule+ to create the
MAILDATA\CAL\HEXID.CAL file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SCHEDULE.KEY file will reserve a hexid number for the user if the user has
received a meeting request from another user, even if the user has never
launched Schedule+ to create the HEXID.CAL file. MoveUser will read the
SCHEDULE.KEY searching for the UserID being moved and determine the user's hexid
number. If the HEXID.CAL for the user is not found, the error will occur.

The MOVEUSER utility is provided with MVUSR.EXE on the Microsoft Software Library
(MSL).
