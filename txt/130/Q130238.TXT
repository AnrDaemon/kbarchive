KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add a macro-substituted memory variable in the Expression
Builder, you receive a "Syntax Error."

CAUSE
=====

Macro substitution is used with command syntax. It is not permitted in the User
Interface.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use EVALUATE() or a named expression that is expressed as "(<variable
name>)".

See the FoxPro "Language Reference" or Help file for more information on how to
use the EVALUATE function, named expressions, or macro substitution.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

1. In the Command window type the following two lines of code:

      cVarName = "Hello"
      cFilter = 'cVarName'

2. Type the following line of code:

      GETEXPR TO cX

3. In the Expression Builder, type &cFilter, and click OK or Verify.
