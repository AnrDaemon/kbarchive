======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an application that uses Remote Registry Services (such as
System Monitor) and you try to connect to a computer that does not exist on the
network, it may take several minutes before you receive a response indicating
that the remote computer cannot be located or connected to.

CAUSE
=====

This situation can occur because Domain Name Service (DNS) resolution is using
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to send name-resolution packets to the DNS server,
which is unreachable. When this occurs, the resolver times out repeatedly,
taking approximately one minute per attempt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation, remove the TCP/IP protocol from the network
adapter or the dial-up adapter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation can occur if you have the following configuration:

 - A physical LAN connection.

 - Dial-Up Networking is installed.

 - The TCP/IP protocol is installed and is bound to both the network adapter and
   the Dial-Up Networking adapter.

 - The system is configured for Remote Registry Services.
