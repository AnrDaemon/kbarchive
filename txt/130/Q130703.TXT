SUMMARY
=======

MAPILogon is a function available with the Simple Messaging Application Program
Interface (MAPI), included with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. MAPILogon is
used to validate and create (or increment) the session handle associated with
any Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Schedule+, Microsoft Electronic Forms, or Simple
MAPI application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MAPILogon, once successfully returned, cannot be called again from the same
thread of execution, for example, to force the download of new messages during a
session. This means that an application making a call to MAPILogon, will not be
able to successfully call it again from the same application. If you attempt to
make a second call to MAPILogon, you will get the following error:

   Error 8, MAPI_E_TOO_MANY_SESSIONS

Before you make a second call to MAPILogon, the caller must first call MAPILogout
to release the session handle being held by the application.

Additional query words: 3.20 MAPILogon
