TITLE   :Route Command Directs Output to Stderr
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the ROUTE command, attempts to re-direct stdout fail. In addition,
"ROUTE /? | MORE" fails to pause after each page.

CAUSE
=====

The ROUTE command is writing output to stderr instead of stdout.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

Because stderr is defined as "2", the following command will work correctly:

   route /? 2>myfile.txt

This instructs the route command to redirect stderr to the file MYFILE.TXT. The
file may then be viewed with Notepad or any other text editor.
