The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Solar System for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Whatsits in Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System to
play games, the program may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may be caused by one of the following:

 - You use the Microsoft Natural Keyboard with the Keyboard Sounds function
   turned on (enabled).
 - You have a problem with your video display driver.

WORKAROUNDS
-----------

Use one of the following two methods to work around the problem.

Problems using the Microsoft Natural Keyboard
---------------------------------------------

If you are using the Microsoft Natural Keyboard with the software supplied, make
sure you turn off (disable) the Keyboard Sounds function. Please follow the
steps below:

1. Open Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Keyboard icon.

3. Select Sounds Off on the Options tab.

Video Driver Problems
---------------------

Make sure your video driver is a current version.

If you are using a video chipset compatible with standard Super VGA drivers,
change your display driver to Super VGA 640x480, 256 colors.

NOTE: Before you make changes to your display driver, always make a copy of the
SYSTEM.INI file, located in the WINDOWS directory. For more information about
how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or
online Help.

For a list of video cards that are compatible with SVGA, please see the following
article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q90734 Changes to Windows Driver Library - Displays

NOTE: Even if your video card is not listed, it still may be compatible with the
Microsoft Super VGA series of drivers.
