When you install Windows NT on a computer that has more than one PCI
adapter, you need to determine which adapter will be the boot host adapter.
The boot host adapter must be the lowest PCI device number. The PCI device
number is determined by the physical slot number that the device is placed
in. For example, a adapter placed in slot one would have a lower PCI device
number than an adapter placed in slot two.
