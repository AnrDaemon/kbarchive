SUMMARY
=======

While the Grid object allows the creation of a number of special effects by
using the Dynamic grid properties, the Grid object itself does not support any
special effects properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information is based on the "SpecialEffect properties" topic in
the Visual FoxPro Help menu.

SpecialEffect properties apply to check box, ComboBox, CommandGroup, Container
Object, Control Object, EditBox, list box, OptionButton, OptionGroup, PageFrame,
Shape, Spinner, and text box objects. It is available at design time and run
time.

The syntax is:

      [Form.]Control.SpecialEffect = Expr

For a PageFrame control, the settings for the SpecialEffect property are:

Expr   Description
0      Raised (Default for controls and objects except Container Object)
1      Sunken
2      Flat (Default for the Container Object only)

NOTE: For a PageFrame control, SpecialEffect is available only if the Tabs
Property is set to false (.F.). Also, the BorderColor property for a PageFrame
applies only when Expr is set to 2 (Flat).

For all other controls, the settings for the SpecialEffect property are:

Expr   Description
0      3D
1      Plain

NOTE: If the Height property is set to a value too small, the 3D setting has no
effect.
