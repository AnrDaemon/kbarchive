SUMMARY
=======

Using a single function, SYS(2018), Visual FoxPro can return the file, field, or
variable name as a parameter for the error messages listed here. Error messages
that have optional error message parameters may not always return a parameter
through SYS(2018). This article describes what is returned from error message
parameters by SYS(2018) depending on which error SYS(2018) is returning.
