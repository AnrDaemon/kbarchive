TITLE   :PRB: Unable to Save Project State Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.0,2.1,4.0

KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC200 kbVC210 kbVC400 kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The development environment was tested with projects that included up to 100
source files. While it is possible to create and successfully use larger
projects in Visual C++, you may encounter problems related to performance or
undocumented errors. Performance problems can often be minimized by increasing
the size of your RAM or swap file.

One known, undocumented error is:

   <Project Name>.VCP
   Unable to save project-specific state information.
   Generic Error

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this error, simplify the project or decrease it in size. In
general, breaking the project up into modules, based on functionality, is the
best way to work around this problem. This can be accomplished through the use
of static or dynamically linked libraries.

There is no defined source file or VCP file limit, because projects are a complex
combination of many interrelated variables.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
