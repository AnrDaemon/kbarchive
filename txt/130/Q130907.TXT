SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to enter Japanese characters using a standard U.S.
keyboard on a localized Japanese version of Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enter Japanese characters using a standard U.S. keyboard on a localized
Japanese version of Windows NT, you must use an Input Method Editor (IME).

IME provides several different methods of entering Hiragana, Hurigana, Katakana,
Kanji, and Romaji characters using Microsoft IME, WX2, VJ2, and ATOK7. The
Microsoft IME input method is used by default. To change the default input
method, run Microsoft IME from the Program Manager "Nihon go jin ka" group.

To invoke IME, you must use the key combination ALT+~ or ALT+` to launch 4
applications (located in the lower right hand corner on your desktop). These
applications provide several Japanese characters you can enter into your
document. To disable IME, you must use the same key combination of ALT+ ~ or
ALT+ ` again.
