TITLE   :PRB: "This operation not supported for Class Member Object"
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the CLONEOBJECT() method is used to duplicate a member of a class, the
error "This operation not supported for Class Member Object" is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The object is a contained member of an instance of a visual class stored in a
class library (.VCX file). Visual FoxPro does not support cloning of contained
member objects. The CLONEOBJECT() method is designed to copy information that is
contained at the object level.

WORKAROUND
==========

If, when designing a wizard or a builder, you plan on duplicating a control at
form design time, define a class for this specific control and place an instance
of this class on the form.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Select the View Class button from the Form Controls toolbar. Select Add, and
   add the Buttons VCX located in the SAMPLES\CONTROLS directory.

3. Select the VCR control, and place it on the form. Select the CmdTop button in
   the Object dropdown.

4. In the Command window, type:

   a. "=ASELOBJ(acmdTop)" (without the quotation marks)
      *Places information about the selected control in the acmdtop array

   b. "acmdTop(1).Cloneobject('cmdtop2') && Generates an error" (without
      the quotation marks)
