TITLE   :PPT: Some PowerPoint Buttons Not Available in Office Binder
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0,97; Win95:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 presentation in an Office
for Windows 95, version 7.0 binder, the presentation design status box as well
as the New Slide and Slide Layout buttons are not available. These buttons are
normally found at the bottom of the PowerPoint screen.

CAUSE
=====

This interface is by design. Office 7.0 binders are OLE clients designed to
provide a common interface and storage area for project- specific data. Binders
are not designed to provide absolute, full functionality in each of the server
applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

All the buttons that are not visible in the Binder have menu equivalents, so no
functionality is lost.
