SUMMARY
=======

Due to the limited amount of memory available to applications in certain
situations on MS-DOS-based clients, the Systems Management Server Audit tool has
been enhanced to allow the administrator to control the number of packages read
at one time from the AUDIT.CFG rule file. This extra control is needed because
the audit can fail due to low memory when the administrator tries to inventory
450 or more packages per pass.

The administrator can change the total number of packages to be audited by
editing AUDIT.RUL to remove the unwanted entries and then recompiling AUDIT.CFG.
To change the number of packages read by AUDIT16 in a single pass of the disk,
edit AUDIT.BAT and add the /Innn switch (where nnn is from 100-450).

By default, AUDIT16 will read 400 packages at a time from AUDIT.CFG, perform a
scan, and then read another 400 packages until the end of AUDIT.CFG is reached
and the audit is complete. The value of 400 is adequate in nearly all
situations.
