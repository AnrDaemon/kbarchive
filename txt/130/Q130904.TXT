TITLE   :32-bit DLL Call From MSMAIL32 to MAPILogon Fails
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.2; winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage SMapiCMC kbSMAPICMC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When making a dynamic link library call to MAPILogon from a 32-bit application
directly to MAPI32.DLL, the call will fail from a custom command or a custom
message in the Windows NT Mail client. The failure occurs in a MAPI error 2
(MAPI_E_FAILURE) which implies a general failure.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the extension DLL is called while the Mail32 internal
lock is on. When the DLL attempts to call out to MAPI, MAPI waits for the
internal lock to be released and hangs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
