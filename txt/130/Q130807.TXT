TITLE   :BUG: READ w/ Numeric Literal Subscript Causes Access Violation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Exporting an array in a COMMON block from a dynamic-link library (DLL) and
attempting to read a member of the array by using a numeric literal as a
subscript in the READ statement may generate an access violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here are two ways to work around this problem:

 - Use INTEGER variables instead of numeric literals as subscripts when
   accessing COMMON arrays.

-or-

 - Read exported COMMON data into local allocatable arrays. Then assign these
   arrays to the arrays in the exported COMMON block.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error occurs only with READ statements. It does not occur with WRITE
statements or when reading COMMON variables.

Sample Code to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------------

   C  The code for the DLL
   C  Compile options needed: /LD
   C
          COMMON /TheBlock[DLLEXPORT]/ CommonBlockIntegerArray(3)
          INTEGER*4 CommonBlockIntegerArray
             CommonBlockIntegerArray(1) = 1
             CommonBlockIntegerArray(2) = 2
             CommonBlockIntegerArray(3) = 3
          END
   C
   C  The code for the EXE.
   C  Compile options needed: none
   C  Linker options needed: include the import library for the DLL
   C
   C  Define the common block for sharing.
   C
         COMMON /TheBlock[DLLIMPORT]/ CommonBlockIntegerArray(3)
         INTEGER*4 CommonBlockIntegerArray
   C
   C  Some local variables.
   C
         INTEGER*4 intTemp
         CHARACTER*3 someText
   C
   C  The main program.
   C
         someText = '11'
         intTemp = 1
   C
   C  If the subscript is an integer variable, there is no problem.
   C
         READ (someText, '(A3)') CommonBlockIntegerArray(intTemp)
   C
   C  The array subscript is a numeric literal, an access violation occurs.
   C
         READ (someText, '(A3)') CommonBlockIntegerArray(1)
         END
