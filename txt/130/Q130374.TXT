SYMPTOMS
========

When you save or print a Windows NT Diagnostics (WINMSD.EXE) report that
includes Hardware information, there may be two or more lines for System BIOS
Version. The first line usually contains correct information, however the rest
of the System BIOS Version lines have erroneous information. For example:

             Microsoft Diagnostics Report For <Computer Name>
