TITLE   :Windows Applications Fail When Using LMHosts File with NetBIOS
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Client Windows-based applications may be unable to connect to server
applications over routers using TCP/IP, even though LMHOSTS entries exist for
the servers. For example, you may be able to use the NET USE command to connect
to a remote machine from the MS-DOS Command Prompt, but cannot connect from file
manager.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 for Windows for
Workgroups, version 3.11a. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the #PRE flag for each entry in LMHOSTS to
ensure they are preloaded into the NetBIOS name cache.
