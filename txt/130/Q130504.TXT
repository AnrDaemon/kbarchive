TITLE   :PRB: Connection Dialog Box Doesn't Show Data Source Choices
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to create a remote view or when using the Connection Designer
functions, you may get a connection dialog box with no available data source
choices. Even though you have ODBC installed and have available data sources in
the ODBC Control Panel in Windows, Visual FoxPro does not seem to recognize the
data sources.

CAUSE
=====

The computer is running Windows 95 or Windows NT but has only 16-bit data
sources installed. Both of these platforms require 32-bit data sources.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use the installed data sources, you must install the 32-bit ODBC components
by reinstalling the ODBC components using Setup or the ODBC Driver 2 Pack.

For information about Windows 95 ODBC drivers, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q128376 ODBC on Windows 95

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
