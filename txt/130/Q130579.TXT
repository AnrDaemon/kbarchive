TITLE   :PRB: UserId and Password Viewable in Database Container
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The userid and password for an ODBC connection are stored in the database
container (.DBC) and are visible to the user if a connection is created for the
database. If previously created data sources are used in an ODBC view rather
than an ODBC connection, the userid and password are not viewable in the .DBC.

CAUSE
=====

When a view or connection is established in Visual FoxPro, you have the option
of specifying the userid and password at that time. If you enter them, they are
saved in the DBC, so they can be seen by using the DISPLAY DATABASE command or
by using the DBC as a table.

RESOLUTION
==========

To maintain security, do not specify the password when setting up the connection
or view. Rely on ODBC to request it. Then the DBC will contain only the
Datasource name.

When creating an executable file, you can explicitly include the DBC in the
project. In this case, the user is not able to display the connection
information. To make this modification, choose Include from the Project menu
with the DBC selected in the project.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. The reasoning for this design is that if you want to
save the password in the DBC, you probably want the convenience of never needing
to type in a password.
