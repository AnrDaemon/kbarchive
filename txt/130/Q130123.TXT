TITLE   :PRB: Can't Find Transporter (TRANSPORT.PRG) in Visual FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

TRANSPORT.PRG no longer exists in FoxPro's home directory and the _TRANSPORT
system memory variable now contains an empty string.

RESOLUTION
==========

The transporter (TRANSPORT.PRG) is now included in the CONVERT.APP application
and a new system variable (_CONVERTER) has been added to Visual FoxPro to point
to CONVERT.APP.

In other words, the transporter code is now built into the converter. When a
transported object's version is prior to version 3.0, CONVERT.APP calls the
TRANSPORT module in CONVERT.APP. This module converts the object first to a
FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows object, and then converts it to a Visual FoxPro
version 3.0 object.

CONVERT.APP is located in the Visual FoxPro home directory. The CONVERT.APP
source code and TRANSPORT.PRG can be found in the \TOOLS\CONVERT subdirectory of
the home directory of the Professional version of Visual FoxPro.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: VFoxWin 3.00
