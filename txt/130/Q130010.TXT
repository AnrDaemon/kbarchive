The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOM
-------

After you install Windows NT Server Tools on your computer running Windows
3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and reboot the computer, File Manager
does not display the expected Security menu and toolbar icon with the
Windows NT Server managing tools.

NOTE: Windows NT Server Tools are available on the Windows NT Server CD in
the CLIENTS\SRVTOOLS\WINDOWS directory.

CAUSE
=====

Windows cannot find the necessary tools because the installation does not
automatically modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. Instead it saves the
necessary changes in the following two files in the directory where the tools
are installed:

   NEW-VARS.BAT
   NEW-CONF.SYS

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this situation:

1. Back up your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.

2. Use a text editor to modify the original AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files to
   include the information in NEW-VARS.BAT and NEW-CONF.SYS files, respectively.

3. Reboot your computer running Windows or Windows for Workgroups for the
   changes to take effect.
