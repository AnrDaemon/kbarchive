The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When a group of files from a directory is selected to be restored, Windows NT
Backup restores only some of them. Backup does not display an error message and
no errors are logged into the log file.

When the directory is selected to be restored, all files are restored. When a
single file is selected from a group of files that were in an earlier case
selected, but not restored, the file is not restored. When a single file is
selected from a group of files that were selected and restored, it is restored.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5.
