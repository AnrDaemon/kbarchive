TITLE   :Removing Everyone On Root Dir. Leaves Limited Virtual Memory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you remove the Everyone group from the root directory permissions of a
Windows NT file system (NTFS) formatted partition that contains the PAGEFILE.SYS
file, the following error message appears when you log on:

   Limited Virtual Memory
   Your system is running without a properly sized paging file.
   Please use the virtual memory option of the System applet in the
   Control Panel to create a paging file, or to increase the initial
   size of your paging file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, add the Everyone group with Full Control permission to
the NTFS partition that contains the PAGEFILE.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not recommend removing the Everyone group from the root directory
permissions of a Windows NT file system (NTFS) formatted partition. By default,
the root directory of a drive is an administrative share in Windows NT.
Therefore, it is not necessary to remove the Everyone group from the root
directory to increase security or prevent certain users on a network to gain
access to your root directory.
