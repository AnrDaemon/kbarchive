-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you export tasks from Microsoft Schedule+ to the Timex Data Link watch,
task priorities 1 through 9 have a higher priority than task priorities A
through Z.

For example:

If you export only those tasks with a priority greater than or equal to C, tasks
1 through 9, as well as A through C, will be exported to the watch.

1. Create three tasks with differing priorities, say 2, C, and D.

2. On the File menu, choose Export. Then choose Timex Watch.

3. Clear all the boxes except Tasks, then choose Next.

4. Select Tasks with a priority greater than or equal to C.

5. Click Finish.

The result is that two tasks with priorities of 2 and C will be exported.
