TITLE   :MS-DOS-Based Application Hangs on Beep Under Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an MS-DOS-based application in full screen mode under Windows NT on
an Intel-based computer, the application may stop responding (hang) when it
tries to print ASCII \007 (CHR$ 7, ^G). The application runs fine in a window.

This problem occurred on several computer models from Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI) and
on an Intel L486 Professional Workstation. All machines were using Phoenix BIOS
1.x and an ET4000W32p-based graphics adapters.

CAUSE
=====

In full screen mode, Windows NT allows the video BIOS to handle screen output
for enhanced MS-DOS compatibility. Some video BIOS hand off this request to the
system BIOS. The Phoenix BIOS version 1.x tries to generate the beep using
hardware that has not been virtualized by Windows NT.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Run the application in a window.

   -or-

 - Replace the graphics adapter with one which handles CHR$7.


If you are using a Siemens-Nixdorf computer, you can contact your dealer or the
manufacturer for an updated system BIOS.
