The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In FoxPro version 2.x, you can't issue a browse and have the entire row selected
when a user clicks. In Visual FoxPro, however, you can create a grid, and have
the entire row selected when a user clicks. This article shows you how.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: You can also use this technique to make the current record in the grid
remain highlighted after the focus is set to another object on the form.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form by using the Form Designer.

2. Bring up the Data Environment for the form by choosing Data Environment from
   the View menu. Select Add to add the customer table located in the
   C:\VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP\DATA directory into the data environment. Drag the
   customer table from the data environment, and drop it onto the form to create
   a grid object.

3. Place the following code in the grid's INIT event:

   

      PUBLIC grno
      grno = RECNO()
      THIS.setall("Dynamicbackcolor", ;
           "IIF(RECNO()=grno,RGB(64,128,128),RGB(255,255,255))","Column")

4. Place the following code in the grid's AfterRowColChange event:

   

      LPARAMETERS nColIndex
      grno = RECNO()
      THIS.Refresh()

5. Run the form, and click different rows. You will see the selected row's
   backcolor is in dark green color.
