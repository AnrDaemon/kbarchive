TITLE   :PC Adm: Err Msg: Notice 9 Error File Not Accessible
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add an external postoffice definition using the Mail Administrator
program (ADMIN.EXE), you may get one of the following messages:

   Notice 9
   Error file not accessible
   Check server connection
   Press Enter to continue

   -or-

   Notice 51
   Error File not accessible
   Check Server connection
   Press enter to continue

CAUSE
=====

The Notice 9 error occurs when the ADMIN.EXE program is unable to access the
following two error message files, which are usually located in the GLB
subdirectory of the postoffice database:

   ERRORADM.GLB
   ERRORDYN.GLB

The Notice 51 error occurs when you try to go into Admin-Queue, and the following
files are missing from the \GLB directory:

   ENGMAI.GLB
   ENGMON.GLB
   ERRORADM.GLB
   ERRORDYN.GLB

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: The following is the resolution for both of the above error messages.

Check the GLB subdirectory for the existence of these files. If they do not
exist, the administrator can replace these files in one of the following ways:

 - Find another postoffice in the Mail system that contains these files and copy
   them from that postoffice to the GLB subdirectory of the problem postoffice.

 - Use the complete set of Setup disks for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC
   Networks, and install a complete temporary postoffice on a local workstation
   hard drive. Be careful to install the complete client software (for both
   MS-DOS and Windows) as well. The temporary postoffice will contain the
   missing files in the GLB subdirectory. Copy the files to the problem
   postoffice's GLB subdirectory.
