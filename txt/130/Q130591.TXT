======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.52 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the CancelToClose member function of the CPropertyPage
class states that this function changes the text of the Cancel button to read
Close. This is incorrect.

The implementation of the CPropertyPage::CancelToClose() function actually does
the following two things:

 - Disables the property sheet's Cancel button.

 - Changes the text of the property sheet's OK button to read Close.

This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0.
