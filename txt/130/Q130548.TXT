SYMPTOMS
========

A tentative appointment does not show in the Date Navigator or in the Planner.

CAUSE
=====

When an appointment is scheduled as tentative, it appears as normal in the
Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views. It will not show in the Date Navigator as a
bold date. Also, it will not show in the Planner view as scheduled time.

This is by product design.
