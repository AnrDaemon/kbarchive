SUMMARY
=======

To start a Wizard from code in the Command window or in a program, use the
_WIZARD system variable. This system variable contains the full path and
filename of the currently assigned wizard application. By default, this is set
to the C:\VFP\WIZARD.APP wizard application that ships with Visual FoxPro. To
launch the full list of available wizards, use this command:

      DO (_WIZARD)

To call a specific type of wizard, pass a parameter to WIZARD.APP such as:

      DO (_WIZARD) WITH 'FORM'

This invokes the Auto Form Wizard if you have a table open. Or you can call a
type of wizard such as:

      DO (_WIZARD) WITH 'QUERY'

This opens the Wizard Selection dialog box with only the Query type of wizards
listed.

The WIZARD.DBF free table located in the C:\VFP\WIZARDS directory contains the
names, descriptions, types, parameters, and other information for all the
wizards included with Visual FoxPro. The Type field in the WIZARD.DBF table
contains the string or name used as the parameter to passed to WIZARD.APP.

To directly call the Form Designer wizard, and by pass the dialog boxes, use the
following:

       DO (_WIZARD) WITH 'Form', 'Form', 'Form'
