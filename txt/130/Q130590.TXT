======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the SNA Server Win3x client (WNAP.EXE) or Win3x client setup,
after having installed NetLauncher by CompuServe, CompuServe's Internet Dialer
(CID.EXE) will load and attempt to connect to the Internet.

CAUSE
=====

CompuServe has introduced a new utility to allow users to connect to the
Internet using their CIS account. This utility, Netlauncher, replaces the
WINSOCK.DLL file located in your <winroot> directory with it's own
version. This version of WINSOCK.DLL contains a hook in it which will launch the
CompuServe Internet Dialer to establish the PPP connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve WINSOCK.DLL problems, CompuServe technical support recommends the
following:

1. Create a batch file that copies over whichever version of WINSOCK.DLL you
   want to use into the \WINDOWS directory.

2. Move NetLauncher's WINSOCK.DLL into both the \CSERVE\CID and \CSERVE\MOSAIC
   directories.

3. Rename the old Windows windsock file (it will be named WINSOCK.000) back to
   its original name, WINSOCK.DLL.

NOTE: You will need to reboot your computer every time you start a sockets
application that requires the WINSOCK.DLL that is not loaded.


NetLauncher is manufactured by CompuServe, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this products' performance or
reliability.
