If you have multimedia Works and Encarta or Bookshelf installed on your
computer, you are able to start Encarta or Bookshelf from Works by using the
Find Information option on the Edit menu.

After you start the program this way, you can do a Topics search, or a Topic
Titles Only search. These searches are treated differently by Encarta and
Bookshelf.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information discusses search methods for use with Encarta and
Bookshelf.

Searching with Encarta 1994 or 1995
-----------------------------------

The Topic Titles Only search looks for a matching title. If it finds an exact
match, it displays the article. If not, it puts the highlighted word from Works
in the text box of the Encarta Pinpointer (1995) or the Contents dialog box
(1994) and lists article titles starting with the closest match.

The Topics search lists all Encarta articles with the selected word anywhere
within the body of the article.

NOTE: When you do a Topics search in Encarta 1995, it may appear that the search
wasn't performed. However, if you click the Word button in Pinpointer, the word
appears.

Searching with Bookshelf 1993, 1994 or 1995
-------------------------------------------

The Topic Titles Only option searches all article titles, listing all titles
beginning with the desired word or closest match, and displays the article with
the closest match.

The Topics search searches all books and lists all articles with the selected
word anywhere within the body of the article, and displays the first article
listed.
