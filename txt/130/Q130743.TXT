TITLE   :Setup Does Not Detect IBM Token Ring 16/4 on IBM Aptiva
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 95 on an IBM Aptiva computer, the IBM Token Ring 16/4
network adapter in the computer may not be detected. If the network adapter is
not detected, it does not function after you install Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if your IBM Aptiva computer contains a Sound Blaster
sound card that is configured to use a base I/O address of 220. A Sound Blaster
card using this base address prevents Windows 95 from detecting the IBM Token
Ring network adapter.


RESOLUTION
==========

To allow Windows 95 to detect and use the IBM Token Ring network adapter, change
the base I/O address that the Sound Blaster card uses to an address other than
220. For information about how to do so, please refer to the Sound Blaster
documentation or contact the hardware manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can also occur with other IBM computer models, including the 350-
and 750-series desktop computers. These computers contain a VIBRA 16 CT2800
sound card, with the same problem as described above.
