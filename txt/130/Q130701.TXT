-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail for Windows mail spooler performs a latency check before
processing a message. A latency check is done by checking to see if there are
any other active processes. This latency check is intended to prevent the mail
spooler background processing from interfering unduly with applications running
in the foreground.

This feature allow users to send mail and then immediately begin working on other
tasks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For those users who do not require the mail spooler to wait until idle time is
detected and wish mail messages to be sent immediately, the ForceScanInterval
entry may be added to the MSMAIL.INI file located in the [Microsoft Mail]
section.

For the immediate sending of mail, the following entry should be added:

   ForceScanInterval=1

With ForceScanInterval set to the value 1, the mail spooler will demand
processing time after 1 second has passed. This is contrary to waiting longer
periods to detect idle time.

The default value for ForceScanInterval is 5 minutes.

NOTE: All users with this option set will experience moments of computer non
responsiveness as the mail spooler immediately processes every message sent.
