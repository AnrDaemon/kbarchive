SUMMARY
=======

Hangeul (Korean) Windows version 3.1 supports the Wansung code set only. However
Hangeul Windows 95 will support the XWansung code set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Two different Hangeul character standards exist in Korea. One is Wansung, and
the other is Johap. The Korean government issued a Korean standard code set
(KSC5601-1987), which is Wansung code set. Hangeul Windows version 3.1 supports
this character set only.

Later, the Korean government amended and added to the standard and issued a new
one (KSC5601-1992), which contains both Wansung and Johap code sets.

Hangeul Windows version 3.1 and Hangeul Windows 95 will not support the
KSC5601-1992 standard. Instead, Hangeul Windows 95 will support the XWansung
(Microsoft Extended Wansung) standard, which is an extended version of the
KSC5601-1987 standard.

The XWansung Code system contains some Johab characters (not all the Johap
codes). Johab characters were added into the vacant Range of old Wansung Code of
Hangeul Windows version 3.1. Here are the details on the XWansung code set:

Number of characters:

     Exisitng Wansung    = 8,836
     Additional Assigned = 8,822 (Johab)
     Additional Reserved = 4,770
     ------------------------------
     Total characters    = 22,428

Leading byte range:    0x81-0xFE
Trailing byte range:   0x41-5A,0x61-0x7A,0x81-0xFE

Additional query words: 1.20 3.10 4.00 3.50 Hangul Chohap kbinf
