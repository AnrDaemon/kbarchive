The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can not use the IdleTime parameter with Dispatch if you are running the Mail
External program (EXTERNAL.EXE) as an idle process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run External as an idle process of Dispatch, Dispatch will
automatically pass the IdleProcessMaxPeriod (-TU) parameter to External, which
will display as the BreakRelative (-BR) command. Therefore, you cannot use the
IdleTime (-N) parameter of Dispatch. If you do try to use the IdleTime
parameter, you will get unpredictable results.

For additional information, please see version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks "Administrator's Guide" page 296.
