The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks administrator removes a postoffice from
the system using the Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE), the postoffice and its
corresponding addresses are not automatically deleted from the Global Address
List (GAL).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Version 3.2, 3.2a, or 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks process of Directory
Synchronization (Dir-Sync) allows for automatic creation and inclusion of new
postoffices. Therefore, it adds new postoffices and its users into the GAL
automatically.

If you remove a postoffice and its users from the GAL, it is not an automated
process. If an administrator removes a postoffice from the system using
ADMIN.EXE, and removes it from the Dir-Sync server, the postoffice and its user
addresses will still be in the GALs of each external postoffice.

The GAL on each postoffice is composed of the individual address list (.USR file)
for each externally defined postoffice in the system. When the Rebuild portion
of Dir-Sync runs, it creates the GAL and references the .USR file from each
postoffice. The external definition (the .USR file) for that removed postoffice
still exists on every postoffice in the network. The only way to update the GAL,
is to run Admin, External- Admin, Delete from each postoffice, then complete an
entire Dir-Sync cycle.
