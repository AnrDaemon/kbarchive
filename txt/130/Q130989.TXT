======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The PROTECTED keyword of the DEFINE CLASS command can be used to protect the
Properties, methods, and objects in a class definition. You may want to use the
PROTECTED keyword to protect an array.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To protect an array property, use the keywords PROTECTED and DIMENSION on
separate lines. For example, the following code would prevent the array from
being changed outside of the CLASS:

      PROTECTED myarray[2]
      DIMENSION myarray[2]

The following code appears to work, but the array isn't protected:

      PROTECTED DIMENSION myarray[2]

REFERENCES

For more information about the PROTECTED clause, search the Visual FoxPro Help
menu.
