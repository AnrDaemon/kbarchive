The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an APPC application does not properly issue TP_ENDED for each matching
TP_STARTED and RECEIVE_ALLOCATE call, the SNA Server client software
eventually runs out of TP control blocks, causing the following error to be
returned on a subsequent RECEIVE_ALLOCATE and TP_STARTED calls:

   

   primary_rc = AP_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR (0xF011)

When writing an invokable APPC transaction program (TP), that issues
RECEIVE_ALLOCATE to accept a new conversation, each successful
RECEIVE_ALLOCATE call returns with a unique transaction program id (tp_id)
as well as a conversation id (conv_id). The conversation is eventually
terminated by the TP or the partner TP by issuing a DEALLOCATE call.
However, the program must still issue TP_ENDED to free up the tp_id as
well, or a TP control block will remain in use on the SNA Server client.
This may eventually cause the SNA Server client to run out of these control
blocks, causing the APPC interface to return AP_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR in
response to a RECEIVE_ALLOCATE call.

NOTE: If the AP_UNEXPECTED_DOS_ERROR is occurring for some other reason,
the SNA Server software may have encountered an error from an underlying
operating system call. Internal SNA Server client traces and APPC API
traces should be generated and passed to SNA Server support personnel to
troubleshoot this type of problem.
