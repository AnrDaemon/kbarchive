======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Windows 95 to use user profiles, some settings are maintained
individually for each user who logs on to the computer (for example, Start menu
settings and desktop settings). However, each user does not get an individual
SendTo folder. By default, the global SendTo folder is used for all users.

CAUSE
=====

There is no setting in the user interface (UI) to maintain separate SendTo
folders for each user.


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

To use a separate SendTo folder for each user who logs on to the computer, follow
these steps:

1. Create a SendTo folder in each user's personal folder. For example, for a
   user named User1, create a SendTo folder in the Windows\ Profiles\User1
   folder.

2. Use Registry Editor to modify the SENDTO value in the following registry key
   for each user to point to the SendTo folder you created for each user:

      HKEY_USERS\USERNAME\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\ 
      EXPLORER\SHELL FOLDERS

3. Create a SENDTO string in the following registry key for each user and set it
   to the SendTo folder you created for each user:

      HKEY_USERS\USERNAME\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\ 
      EXPLORER\USER FOLDERS

4. Create shortcuts in the SendTo folders that will appear when the users click
   objects with the right mouse button and then click Send To.

5. Restart the computer.

To add locations to the global SendTo folder for all users, add shortcuts to the
default SendTo folder (typically C:\Windows\SendTo).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
