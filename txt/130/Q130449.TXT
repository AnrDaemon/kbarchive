may be displayed:

This error message can also be caused by insufficient disk space on the server
hosting the postoffice (PO).

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a new INQUEUE.KEY and INQUEUE.MBG file.

To create a new INQUEUE.KEY file
--------------------------------

   debug INQUEUE.KEY
   -rcx
   CX 0000
   :230
   -f100,32f,0
   -w
   -q

To create a new INQUEUE.MBG file
--------------------------------

   M:\MBG> type nul > INQUEUE.MBG
