TITLE   :"Not Recognized" Error Using PKZIP.EXE with Ampersand (&) Switch

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

When you use PKZIP.EXE with the ampersand (&) switch to span multiple floppy
disks, the following error message appears:

   The name specified is not recognized as an internal or external command,
   operable program or batch file.

CAUSE
=====

The ampersand switch is not interpreted by the Command Prompt (CMD.EXE) because
it is a reserved command character, used to separate multiple commands on one
line. Therefore, the characters following the ampersand are interpreted as a bad
name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the carrot character (^), above the "6" key,
which allows you to input command characters as text. For example, to compress
the C:\DATA directory over multiple floppy disks on the A drive, you would use
the following command:

   PKZIP A:\DATA.ZIP C:\DATA\*.* -^&

Alternatively, you can surround the ampersand character with quotes such as
follows:

   PKZIP A:\DATA.ZIP C:\DATA\*.* "-&"

PKZIP is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
