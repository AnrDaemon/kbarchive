SUMMARY
=======

System Management Server uses a SQL Login Id to manage the its database on a SQL
Server. Systems Management Server uses the SQL Server System Administrator (SA)
account by default. The following procedure outlines how to change the SQL Login
Id.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Use the SQL Server Administrator Utility to login to the SQL Server 4.21a (or
   later) containing the Systems Management Server database. Login with an SA
   account.

2. Open up the System Logins Window. If the Login Id you intend to use already
   exits on the SQL server proceed with Step 5.

3. Choose Manage/Add Login...

4. Specify the Login ID and password in the appropriate fields and choose OK.

5. Open the Query Window.

6. In the Query Window, type the following information:

   use SMS
   go
   sp_changedbowner "login id", true
   go

7. Execute the Query.

8. Run the System Management Server setup utility on the Primary Site Server.

9. Choose continue, then choose Operations.

10. Choose SMS Database.

11. Change the Login ID and password.

12. Choose OK.

The Setup program will restart the Systems Management Server services. Once this
has completed the setup program can be exited.

NOTE: The Login ID that you give to Systems Management Server should not be a
user of the database prior to executing Step 6. If the Login ID is a user of the
database, drop the Login ID from the database before proceeding with Step 6.
