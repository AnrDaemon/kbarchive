The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a Novell network server with the Microsoft client for NetWare
networks, you may not be able to view the details of the login script by
clicking the Details button.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the login script is so short that it has already
finished executing by the time you click the Details button.

RESOLUTION
==========

The login script processor in Windows 95 normally runs login scripts without
displaying any output from the commands that are run to the screen. Clicking the
Details button opens a window that displays the output from the commands that
are run in the login script. When the login script is finished, the window
closes.

To keep the window open on the screen, place a Pause command at the end of your
login script. The Pause command forces the execution of the login script to halt
until you press a key. It also forces the login script processor to open a
window displaying the script file output.
