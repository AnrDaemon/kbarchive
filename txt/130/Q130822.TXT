The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SUMMARY
=======

The File and Print Sharing for NetWare Networks network service (NWSERVER.VXD)
that is included with Windows 95 supports double-byte character set (DBCS)
naming of NCP servers. However, while the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
(NWREDIR.VXD) also supports DBCS server names, the Novell NetWare VLM client
does not.

Therefore, to connect to a Windows 95 computer that is running the File and Print
Sharing for NetWare Networks network service and has a DBCS server name, you
must be using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Double-byte character sets include character sets such as Japanese and Kanji
that use 16 bits to store each character. Single-byte character sets (such as
the English character set) use only 8 bits to store each character.
