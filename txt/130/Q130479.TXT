TITLE   :FTP OnNet PPP Connection to Windows NT 3.5 RAS Server Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run FTP OnNet 1.1 under Windows for Workgroups 3.11 as a dial-in PPP
client and connect to a Windows NT 3.5 Remote Access Service (RAS) server, the
connection fails during the PPP negotiation phase.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, enable the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and
Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) on the PPP client. To do
this, edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file on the client computer and add the following:

   ppp16550 -K

NOTE: The letter K must be in uppercase. The FTP OnNet PPP client software uses
PPP16550 to enable the PPP client functionality.

OnNet is manufactured by FTP, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
