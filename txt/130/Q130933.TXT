Administrators are granted a licensed connection to a server running in the
Per Server mode even though the new connection will exceed the number of
available licenses on that server. This is to ensure that administrators
can access servers at all times.

NOTE: If a normal user is connected to the server and they close their
connection, another connection will not be issued until a legal license is
freed.

Additional query words: prodnt License Manager
