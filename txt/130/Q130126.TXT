KEYWORDS:kbenv kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The System Info... dialog that comes up when you choose About Microsoft Visual
FoxPro... from the Help menu may report incorrect MS-DOS or Windows versions,
depending on the operating system in use. A table in the "More Information"
section of this article details the results.


WORKAROUND
==========

The OS() function gives a more accurate description of the operating system
under Windows NT. The results are as follows if you use the OS() function
instead of the Help menu:

                              Current Operating System
                 --------------------------------------------------
                  Windows/           Windows/          Windows NT
                  WFW 3.1            WFW 3.11          version 3.5

   OS()           Correct            Correct
                  MS-DOS Version     MS-DOS Version    Windows NT 3.50

   OS(1)          Windows 3.10       Windows 3.10      Windows NT 3.50


Under Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, the program WINVER.EXE can be used to
return the current Windows version. WINVER will report version 3.11 if executed
from an MS-DOS prompt, but will report 3.10 if executed from within Windows
through Program Manager or File Manager.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
