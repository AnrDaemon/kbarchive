SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the properties for a Novell NetWare server, the number of
connections reported may vary with the NetWare Client software you are using and
the NetWare version that is installed on the server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks consumes
one attachment while it retrieves information from the server. The NETX client
does not consume this attachment while retrieving information. The number of
connections reported reflects the number of attachments, not the number of
logged-in connections.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NetWare version 2.x servers count attachments. This number includes the number
of authenticated users.

NetWare versions 3.x and 4.x count only authenticated users, and do not count the
extra attachment to retrieve information.

Therefore, if you connect to a NetWare 2.x server with the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks, 2 connections are reported. If you connect to the same server
with the NETX client instead, one connection is reported.
