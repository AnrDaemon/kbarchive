SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to display only those records that meet a
given criteria in a grid on a form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To display only those records that meet a given criteria, use one of the
following three methods described below.

Method One
----------

1. If you want to restrict the output to records where status='Y', select the
   table being displayed in the grid.

2. Next, use the SET FILTER TO <expression> command, as in this example:

         SELECT <TableName>
         SET FILTER TO status = 'Y'

Method Two
----------

1. Create a query that selects the required records, and save the query.

2. Set the grid's RecordSourceType property to 3 - Query and the RecordSource
   property to the .QPR file for your query.

Method Three
------------

Use a parameterized view. To create a parameterized view, choose View Parameters
from the Query menu in the View Designer, or use the CREATE SQL VIEW command
with a "?" symbol and a parameter name, as in this example:

      CREATE SQL VIEW customer_data;
         AS SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer.country = ?cCountry

This example includes all records where the Country field in the Customer table
match the value in the cCountry memory variable. If cCountry did not exist at
the time the form was created, a dialog box would appear asking for the value of
cCountry. To use a parameterized query as the source of data for the grid, set
the RecordSource property to 1 - Alias and the RecordSource property to the name
of the view.
