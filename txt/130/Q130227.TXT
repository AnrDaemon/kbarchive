When you configure the import list for directory replication, you have the
option to add more than one domain to the From List. If each of these
domains are replicating to the same directory, such as the default
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS directory, only one of those
domain's files are stored in the directory.

The server imports files from the first domain and then imports files from
the second domain. When it sees that there are files in the import
directory that don't match what is coming from the second domain, it
removes those files. Those files were from the first domain, so now the
first domain's files are no longer in this server's import directory.

Windows NT behaves this way by design. An import computer can import from
many domains and computers, but a given subdirectory can only be imported
from one exporter. In particular, no two of the exporters may contain a
REPL\EXPORT\SCRIPTS directory.
