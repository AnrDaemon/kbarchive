TITLE   :PC NTMMTA: Cannot Browse Service Accounts on NT Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a service in Service Manager, and if you press the Browse button
on the Service Account line, the Add Users and Groups dialog box will not
appear. The Create Service screen border will blink (change colors), and nothing
else will happen.

CAUSE
=====

The browse button will not allow browsing of a server account database. If the
computer is logged into a domain, then browsing will display users in the domain
account database. If it is part of a workgroup, the account needs to be entered
manually.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enter a user from the server account database, type in the service account.
For example, in the Create Service dialog box, the Service Account option would
be WORKSTATION\USERNAME.
