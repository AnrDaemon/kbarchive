TITLE   :PRB: DAO References Not Enabled When Porting an Older VB App
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A reference to any database object or method in a Visual Basic program generates
the error:

   User-defined type not defined

This error often occurs when loading your first Visual Basic version 3.0 program
into Visual Basic version 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

When you load your first Visual Basic version 3.0 project, a dialog box asks
you:

   Would you like Visual Basic to add this library reference now?

If you selected the "No for All Older Projects" button, an entry was made in your
VB.INI file that says AutoReferenceDAO=1. If you remove this line, you will see
the dialog box again and be able to add needed Visual Basic 3.0 project
references automatically.

RESOLUTION
==========

For the current project, choose References from the Tools menu, and select the
Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.0 Compatiblity Library check box. This enables compatibility
with the older syntax found in Visual Basic version 3.0 programs. Microsoft
reccommends that you upgrade the syntax in your programs to the new DAO 3.0
syntax used in Visual Basic version 4.0, replacing the DAO 2.5/3.0 with the DAO
3.0.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
