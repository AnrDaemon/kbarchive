TITLE   :PRB: dBASE Functions Give "File <name> Does not exist" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing the following valid dBASE IV functions in Visual FoxPro causes the error
"File <name> does not exist" instead of the error message "Function not
implemented":

      CALL()
      CATALOG()
      CERROR()
      DGEN()
      ISMARKED()
      LKSYS()
      RUN()

NOTE: dBASE IV is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.

CAUSE
=====

These functions are not valid Visual FoxPro functions.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are no equivalent Visual FoxPro commands for CATALOG(), CERROR(),
ISMARKED(), LKSYS(), and DGEN().

Use the Visual FoxPro RUN command in place of the dBASE RUN() function and the
Visual FoxPro CALL command in place of the dBASE CALL() function.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Issue any of the functions listed above in the Command window. For example:

      ? ISMARKED()

If this was a supported function, FoxPro would give a different error.

NOTE: ? CATALOG() will open the Catalog Manager in FoxPro version 2.6. Visual
FoxPro does not support the Catalog Manager.
