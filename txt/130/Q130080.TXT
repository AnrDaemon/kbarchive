======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you compose a new message or delete a message in Microsoft Exchange in
Windows 95, you may receive one of the following error messages if the Post
Office exists on a Novell NetWare server:

   - File already created.

   - File in use.

   - Recipient's mailbag is busy or in use.

Or, when you are running the Microsoft Mail Admin tool, you may receive a message
stating that the FLAG.GLB or MASTER.GLB file is locked.

CAUSE
=====

These are network errors rather than Microsoft Exchange errors. The error
messages are caused by the failure of the network to close a file after the
application places its close file command. This problem can be due to a bad
packet, a faulty network adapter, poor cabling, or a switch or patch may be
necessary on the server.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Quit and restart Windows 95 to release the file.

 - Use the Novell patch to fix the file locking problem. Obtain the CROPNFX.NLM
   file from Novell. This file is dated 12/18/91 and has a size of 1040 bytes.

 - Troubleshoot the problem as a network problem.
