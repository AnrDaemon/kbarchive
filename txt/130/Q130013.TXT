TITLE   :IPX Addressing Format For Microsoft SNMP Agents
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you enter the trap destination IPX address for a client computer running
an SNMP management program, such as Hewlett-Packard (HP) OpenView, the following
error message appears when you restart Windows NT:

   Error 3

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the SNMP Service Configuration of the IPX address in
Windows NT is incorrect. The trap destination address for Microsoft SNMP must
use the "8.12" format for the network number and Media Access Control (MAC)
address. For example, HP OpenView may use a comma or a hyphen to for separation
between a network number and a MAC address, such as 00008022,0002C0-F7AABD. The
Windows NT SNMP agent does not recognize this address, thus cannot send any
traps to the computer using the SNMP management program.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, enter the IPX address for the trap destination in the
8.12 format. For example, the following format is valid:

   xxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyyyyyy

where xxxxxxxx is the network number and yyyyyyyyyyyy is the MAC address.
