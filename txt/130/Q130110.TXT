KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to access the DriveSpace volume on a compressed PCMCIA hard
disk, compressed floppy disk, or other compressed removable media. Windows
Explorer (or My Computer) may display only the host drive on a recently inserted
media device.

CAUSE
=====

DriveSpace does not automatically mount compressed removable media devices
unless a compression driver is loaded in memory. If there are no compressed
drives in your computer, the DriveSpace driver is not loaded until you run
DriveSpace.

RESOLUTION
==========

To mount the compressed volume on a removable media device, follow these steps:

1. Start DriveSpace.

2. Click the drive that contains the compressed volume.

3. On the Advanced menu, click Mount.
