-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the IPX/SPX compatible transport protocol (NWLink) in Windows NT or
Windows for Workgroups, it may not connect to a Microsoft SQL Server.


CAUSE
=====

When SQL Server starts listening on SPX, it registers itself with the bindery on
a NetWare server. Clients attempting to connect read from the bindery to make
the connection to the SQL Server computer. This process fails if no NetWare
server exists on the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the following format to connect to a SQL server:

      isql -Usa -P -S<MAC address>,<IPX port number>,<Network number>

NOTE: The default IPX port number for a SQL server is 33854. A network number is
not required if the SQL server is on the same segment.

Additional query words: prodnt 3.10 3.11 nwfp ncp
