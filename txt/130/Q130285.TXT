SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the MAILQ16.EXE utility that ships in the Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks Resource Kit.

MAILQ16.EXE is a Microsoft Windows-based program that allows a Microsoft Mail
Administrator to reset or rebuild any Microsoft Mail Mailbag (set of .KEY and
.MBG files).

MORE INFORMATION
================

MAILQ16.EXE allows a Microsoft Mail Administrator to reset or rebuild any of the
following types of mailbags:

 - A Mailbag belonging to any local user on the postoffice.

 - A Mailbag belonging to any external postoffice defined.

 - A Mailbag belonging to any gateway defined on the postoffice.

 - System Mailbag (SYSTEM.KEY and SYSTEM.MBG).

 - INQUEUE.

 - INQUEUE3.

When you reset a mailbag, it involves clearing out the .KEY file and resetting
all bytes to zero, and resetting the .MBG file to zero bytes in size. All mail
present in the mailbag will be lost.

When you rebuild a mailbag, it involves allowing the Administrator to view the
headers present in the mailbag. The Administrator can select which headers
should be restored. The program then creates a new mailbag and copies the
selected headers into the new mailbag. In case a header selected does not have
corresponding .MAI file, the program has the ability (if the option is set) to
generate a stub message in place of the missing .MAI file.


For further information on the program, please refer to the Help file
accompanying the program that explains the different options available in the
program.
