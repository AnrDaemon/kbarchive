KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT file servers may log error 2000 in the event log with the following
data:

   0000: 00040000 00540001 00000000 c00007d0
   0010: 00000000 c000000d 00000000 00000000
   0020: 00000000 00000000 00000bcd

CAUSE
=====

If a user application request is submitted illegally by a client application,
the server logs the failure. The server is failing a
SrvQueryBasicAndStandardInformation() call, with an "Invalid Parameter" status.
The following commands result in the same error:

   dir \\servername\ipc$
   dir \\servername\pipe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for Windows NT. For

Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

SRV.SYS has been modified so that these messages are no longer logged and the
smbs are discarded resulting in an application error.
