TITLE   :Windows NT 3.5: STOP 0x0000000a in NETBT.SYS When Memory is Low
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows NT 3.5 with TCP/IP installed on a network using the Windows
Internet Naming Service (WINS), a STOP 0x0000000a message appears.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT memory manager could not allocate a memory block of the requested
size and returned STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES to the calling function. This
occurs when your system runs low on available memory (physical memory and page
file memory). Instead of checking first whether the pointer to the requested
memory block is NULL, which it is in this case, the code continues to use that
pointer as if it was successfully initialized. This causes the STOP 0x0000000a
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, install more RAM on your computer or make more disk
space available for the Windows NT page file.

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51 or obtain the fix
mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
