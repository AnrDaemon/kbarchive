The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for MS-DOS, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, SourceSafe appears to place an incorrect date/time stamp on a
file after a GET, UPDATE, or CHECKOUT.

CAUSE
=====

This is a system-defined option that may be set accordingly.

RESOLUTION
==========

SourceSafe has three methods of placing a date/time stamp on a file. By default,
SourceSafe places the current system date/time stamp on the files. This may be
confusing or ill-suited for some users, because the time on the files does not
give a good representation of the recent file history.

SourceSafe provides the user with the ability to place a different date/time
stamp on the file if needed. The following is a listing of the date/time options
and how they affect SourceSafe:

   SetTime = Current (default)
             Places the current system time on SourceSafe files.

   SetTime = Mod (modification date)
             Places the file's modification date on each SourceSafe file.

   SetTime = Update
             Places the date/time that the file was updated in the
             SourceSafe database.

Both Mod and Update allow the user to see the age of a file at a glance. These
times may be preferred by some customers because they are a better
representation of when the file was last modified by a SourceSafe user.

These settings may be set on a global basis in the SRCSAFE.INI file or may be set
from within the SourceSafe GUI by selecting SETUP, COMMAND SETTINGS, and
selecting the SET FILE TIME option. In Visual SourceSafe version 4.0, use the
Tools, Options menu item, select the Local Files Tab, and Set Date/Time on Local
Files.
