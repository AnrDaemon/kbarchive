The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists COM port switches that are used in the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file for previous versions of Windows and how those switches can
be used in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following table lists the COM port switches, valid values for those
switches, and where the switches can be used in Windows 95:

   Switch           Value                Windows 95 Location
   --------------------------------------------------------
   COMxAutoAssign   Number or seconds    SYSTEM.INI
   COMxBase         I/O address          Registry
   ComxBuffer       number of characters SYSTEM.INI
   COMMDrv30        True or false        Registry
   COMxFIFO         True or false        SYSTEM.INI
   COMxIRQ          IRQ number           Registry
   COMIRQSharing    True or false        Registry
   COMxProtocol     XOFF or blank        SYSTEM.INI


If the Windows 95 location in the table above is SYSTEM.INI, you can use the
setting in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file in Windows 95. The
setting will affect only MS-DOS-based programs.

If the Windows 95 location in the table above is Registry, the setting can be
modified using the Windows 95 graphical user interface (GUI). The setting will
affect only Windows-based programs. If you place the setting in the SYSTEM.INI
file it will be ignored.
