SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Disk Administrator and attempt to create a striped set with parity,
you receive the following error message:

   DEVICE IS BUSY

RESOLUTION
==========

When you run Disk Administrator and attempt to create a striped set with parity,
be sure to allow enough time for the striped set to initialize. If a format of
the striped set is attempted before the striped set is initialized, the error
"DEVICE IS BUSY" is displayed and the format attempt is aborted.

NOTE: On a DEC Alpha with three 2 gigabyte drives, the striped set with parity
took approximately 80 minutes to initialize.
