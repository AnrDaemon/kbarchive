Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download MHSINP.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "mhsinp"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

   INPOST.EXE (73,211 bytes, dated 04-12-95, 10:32 P.M.)
   README.TXT (this file)

To update your INPOST.EXE file
------------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER after each line

   " copy <path>:\inpost.exe <destination> " (without the quotation
   marks)

where <path> is the drive and directory where you ran the self extracting
MHSINP.EXE file and <destination> is the drive and directory where your
INPOST.EXE file currently resides. For example, if you ran the self-extracting
file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your INPOST.EXE file is located in
the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

   " copy d:\test\inpost.exe c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)
