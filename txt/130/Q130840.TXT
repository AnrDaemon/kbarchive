-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Visual FoxPro allows you to append records from one remote view to
another as long as the source target databases do not contain general fields and
the field names in the source and target databases are identical.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code example shows how to append records from one remote view to
another. To demonstrate this code, create two remote views (source and target)
that contain fields of identical names. Copy the following code into an empty
program file (.PRG), and run it:

   SELECT view1  && view1 is the name of the view pointing to the source file
   SCAN
      SCATTER MEMVAR MEMO
      SELECT view2  && view2 is the name of the view pointing to the target
                    && file
      APPEND BLANK
      GATHER MEMVAR MEMO
      SELECT view1
   ENDSCAN

For information on how to create a remote view, please see the "Creating a Remote
View" topic under "Remote Views" in the Visual FoxPro Help file.
