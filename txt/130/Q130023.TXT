SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the RasDial() function incorrectly states the possible
values for the members of one of the parameters, the RASDIALPARAMS structure.
The documentation states:

   If both the szUserName and the szPassword members are empty strings (""),
   Remote Access uses the username and password of the currently logged-on user
   for authentication.

This API explicitly requires the name and the password for a valid RAS account
even if the account belongs to the currently logged-on user. Specifying empty
strings for the username and password members of RASDIALPARAMS results in
authentication failure.

NOTE: This is only a problem in 16-bit Windows. The Win32 version of the
RasDial() function implements it as documented.
