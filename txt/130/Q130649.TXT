TITLE   :Writer/Artist: ErrMsg: There Isn't Enough Space to Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0,1.1,1.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Creative Writer or Fine Artist on your Macintosh,
you may receive one of the following error messages:

   There isn't enough free space on any of your disks to set up this program.
   Free up some disk space and run Setup again.

   -or-

   There isn't enough disk space on any of your disks to set up Fine Artist. To
   set up this program, you need 10 MB of free disk space. To free disk space,
   click Quit. From the desktop, backup or copy old documents to a floppy disk,
   and then remove those documents from your hard disk. Run Setup again.

   -or-

   There isn't enough space on any of your disks to install this program. You
   must have at least 6 megabytes free. Free some space and run Setup again.

CAUSE
=====

The error message is probably because you don't have enough space available on
your hard drive.

The error can also occur if there are quotation marks, certain keycap symbols or
cut-and-paste objects (symbols) in the name of the hard drive. When these
symbols are present, Setup can't identify the drive and the error message is
generated. Additionally, if the hard drive does not have a name, you receive
this error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to end the error message so you can complete Setup.
Initially, try the first solution. If you are not using symbols, or your problem
still occurs, try the second set of steps to increase your drive space.

If You Have Symbols in Your Hard Drive Name
-------------------------------------------

Setup cannot recognize the hard drive with symbols in the name. To remove these,
do the following:

1. Click the hard drive name field.

2. Wait a moment. When the name is selected, press the DEL key.

3. Type a new hard drive name, using only the keyboard letter keys.

For more information on changing the name of your hard drive, refer to your
Macintosh user's guide.

Increasing Space on Your Hard Drive
-----------------------------------

The following steps help determine you how much drive space you have available,
and tell how to gain the hard drive space required by Setup.

Find out how much space is available on your hard drive:

1. Double-click your hard drive.

2. From the View menu, choose By Icon.

3. The right side of the hard drive window now shows the amount of available
   hard drive space.

4. Check this amount against the minimum amount required by your program:
    - 8 MB for Creative Writer, version 1.0, on 3.5-inch disks.

    - 10 MB for Fine Artist, version 1.0, on 3.5-inch disks.

    - 6 MB for either Creative Writer or Fine Artist, version 1.1, on CD-ROM.

5. To increase hard drive space, copy unnecessary files and applications to a
   floppy disk, then delete those files and applications from the hard drive.

6. Again, check the amount of space available on your hard drive. When you have
   enough for the program you are installing, run Setup again.

For information about copying and deleting files on your Macintosh, see your
Macintosh printed documentation or online Help.
