SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Server Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Manager offers a
feature named Reconcile. Reconcile fixes inconsistent IP addresses. This option
can be chosen from the Active Leases dialog box in DHCP Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Inconsistency of IP addresses in DHCP service can occur when leases are recorded
in the Registry but are not reflected in the DHCP database. The Reconcile option
in the Active Leases dialog box does a consistency check on the DHCP database
and lists all inconsistent IP addresses in that scope.

To correct the inconsistency, choose this option and select all IP addresses that
need to be fixed. Reconcile either restores those IP addresses to the original
owner or creates a temporary reservation for those addresses. These reservations
will be valid for the lease time assigned to the scope. Once the lease time is
expired the addresses will be recovered for future use.
