======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print colored text or graphics to a black and white printer, all
non-white colors are printed as black. Even light gray text or graphics is
printed as black.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs when you print using the UNIDRV.DLL driver. The UNIDRV.DLL
driver maps all non-white colors to black when you print to a black and white
printer.

Note that some printers that do not use the UNIDRV.DLL driver print light gray to
a black and white printer.

If you are using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4-series printer with the
printer drivers included with Windows 95, you can work around this behavior by
using the Windows 3.1 printer driver from HP. This driver does not use the
UNIDRV.DLL driver.

Additional query words: grey gray scale font
