SUMMARY
=======

The mapping of SNADS DGNs is required at the gateway postoffice only.

Mapping is accomplished via the Administrator program, by selecting Gateways,
SNADS, Map, Mapping. Type the network name of the network to map, then type the
name of the postoffice to map. Type the DGN name, as defined on the SNADS
network, for the postoffice requiring mapping.

Mapping is required only in the following instances:

 - The postoffice name is more than 8 characters. For example

   Network = Microsoft, Postoffice = Washington

   could be mapped to Washingt or any DGN of 8 characters or less. That is:

   Microsoft/Washington maps to Washingt

 - The postoffice name is 8 characters or less, but it does not exactly match
   its DGN. For example:

   Network = Microsoft, Postoffice = Wash

   However, the DGN (as defined by SNADS) is Washst. That is:

   Microsoft/Wash maps to Washst

 - The postoffice name conflicts with an existing DGN. This could mean there are
   two postoffices with the same postoffice name but different network names.
   For example

   Network = Microsoft, Postoffice = Wash

   and there is an existing DGN named Wash. That is:

   Microsoft/Wash maps to Wash1

   Another example:

   Network1 = Microsoft, Network2 = Support, Postoffice(s) = Wash

   Microsoft/Wash maps to Wash1
   Support/Wash maps to Wash

1. The postoffice network name is different on a downstream postoffice than it
   is on the gateway postoffice. For example:

   Gateway Postoffice Network name = Microsoft,
   Gateway Postoffice name = Wash,
   Downstream Postoffice Network name = DNSmsft,
   Downstream Postoffice = DNS

   Microsoft/Wash will map to Wash by default
   DNSmsft/DNS maps to DNS
