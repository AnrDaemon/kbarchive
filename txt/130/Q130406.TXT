SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for the Form.Show method contains an error. Passing a 2 as the
parameter for the show method doesn't set a form or formset to a modeless state.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, there is no way to change a form or formset from a modal state to a
modeless state. You must set the Form.WindowType property to 0 - Modeless at
design time to create a modeless form. This property is read-only at runtime.

If a 1 is passed as a parameter to the Form.Show method, a modeless form can be
set to a modal state. Once the form or formset has been changed, however, it
cannot be reset back to a modeless state.
