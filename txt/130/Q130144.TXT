PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe

KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are trying to install SourceSafe version 3.1 for Windows on a Novell
server, where the workstation is using Virtual Loadable Module (VLM) version 1.1
software, an error message occurs during the installation process. You cannot
complete the installation. This error occurs even after any virus-protection
software is disabled. Different error messages will appear, depending on which
Novell server you are installing to.

One of the following error messages will occur:

   Cannot change properties of the file named: <path>\SSD.EXE


-or-

   Could not open the file named: <path>\SSD.EXE


When you are trying to cancel the installation, you may receive this error
message:

   Microsoft Test Driver (ds) Error Runtime Error: Undefined Error
   SETUP.INC(1005)

NOTE: These errors can also occur if you are not using VLM.EXE and the line READ
ONLY COMPATIBILITY=ON is in your NET.CFG file. If you change this line to READ
ONLY COMPATIBILITY=OFF, SourceSafe for Windows will install correctly.

CAUSE
=====

In version 1.1 of VLM.EXE, Novell changed the default value for READ ONLY
COMPATIBILITY from OFF to ON.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are getting a failed installation on a Novell server and the workstation
is using VLM version 1.1, do one of the following:

 - Modify the NET.CFG or SHELL.CFG file. Under the "Network DOS Requestor"
   section, add the following line:

         READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY = OFF

-or-

 - Install SourceSafe locally and then copy all the files to the appropriate
   network directory.

NOTE: These solutions apply only to Novell workstations using VLM.EXE version
1.1, which is loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or STARTNET.BAT file. You can determine
the version of VLM.EXE either by rebooting the workstation and watching for the
loading of the VLM software or by typing "VLM /D" (without the quotation marks)
at the command prompt. The /D option displays the diagnostic information
(including the version number) for the VLM software.
