The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a

SUMMARY
=======

All sounds you record in Creative Writer or Fine Artist are stored in a single
file: the ~MAX.SND file in Creative Writer and the ~MAG.SND file in Fine Artist.
The only way to delete sounds you have recorded is to delete the ~MAX.SND or
~MAG.SND file.

NOTE: This deletes all the sounds you have recorded; there is no way to
selectively remove a sound.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using Windows, use the following steps to remove your recorded
sounds:

1. Locate the ~MAX.SND file (for Creative Writer) or ~MAG.SND file (for Fine
   Artist). The file locations are as shown below

      <drive>:\MSKIDS\USERS\YOURNAME\~MAX.SND
      <drive>:\MSKIDS\USERS\YOURNAME\~MAG.SND

   where <drive> is the letter of your hard drive.

   For information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
   printed documentation or online Help.

2. From the File menu, choose Delete to remove the .SND file.

If you are using a Macintosh, use the following steps to remove your recorded
sounds:

1. Double-click your hard drive, open the Mskids folder, and open the Users
   folder.

2. Inside the Users folder, open the folder with your nickname, and select the
   ~MAX.SND file (for Creative Writer) or ~MAG.SND file (for Fine Artist).

3. Drag the .SND file to the Trash. From the Special menu, choose Empty Trash.

By following these steps, you have removed any sounds that you recorded in
Creative Writer and/or Fine Artist.
