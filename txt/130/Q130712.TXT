TITLE   :PRB: Win32s Errors During Visual FoxPro Installation
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Visual FoxPro version 3.0, you may see the following message:

   Win32s error
   Improper installation
   Win32s requires w32s.386 in order to run
   Reinstall win32s

CAUSE
=====

This is not a Win32s problem. It is related to a missing Device=*vmcpd line in
the 386Enh section of the SYSTEM.INI file. This line provides a virtual device
driver for math coprocessors.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add this line:

   Device=*vmcpd

to the 386ENH section of the SYSTEM.INI file, and re-run setup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A virtual device driver (VxD) is a 32-bit, protected-mode, dynamic-link library
that manages a system resource, such as a hardware device or installed software
so that more than one application can use the resource at the same time. Virtual
devices work in conjunction with Windows to process interrupts and carry out I/O
operations for a given application without disrupting how other applications
run. A virtual device is required for any hardware device that has settable
operating modes or retains data over any period of time. In other words, if the
state of the hardware device can be disrupted by switching between multiple
applications, the device must have a corresponding virtual device. The virtual
device keeps track of the state of the device for each application and ensures
that the device is in the correct state whenever an application continues.
