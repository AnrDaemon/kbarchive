TITLE   :PC Ext: External Stops Mail with DrivesWan Option
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Mail External program (EXTERNAL.EXE) is run with the Netbios option, it
stops delivering mail after it receives a Netbios datagram (for a priority 5
mail message) from a postoffice (PO) that is connected using the DrivesWAN
option.

CAUSE
=====

The MTA (for example, EXTERNAL.EXE) configured to use the DrivesWAN option that
is connected to the PO where the high-priority message originated also receives
the datagram and tries to process it. However, External is not configured to
process the datagram, and the datagram enters an infinite loop.

The MTA connected to the PO using the DrivesWAN option also receives the datagram
and tries to process it. Because it not designed to process the datagram, it
enters into an infinite loop. As a result, the messages in the queue are not
processed until the Mail External program (EXTERNAL.EXE) on the MTA is
restarted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in EXTERNAL.EXE version 3.2.16.
This problem was corrected in EXTERNAL.EXE version 3.2.18. If you do not have
