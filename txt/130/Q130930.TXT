To create an FT boot floppy to boot the mirror drive attached to the
secondary channel/bus of a Multibus SCSI adapter, you must modify the
Arc path in the BOOT.INI file. For scsi(x)disk(y)rdisk(z)parition(a), the
variable (y) should be calculated as follows:

   y= [ (scsi bus/channel number) x (32) ] + (scsi id of the disk)

For example, the Adaptec AHA-2740T/2742T has two channels; SCSI Channel A
(bus 0) and SCSI Channel B (bus 1). Each channel can accommodate a SCSI bus
with up to seven devices. If the Windows NT mirror drive is located on the
first partition on a SCSI disk with the target ID of 4, and is connected to
SCSI Channel B (bus number 1) of an Adaptec AHA-2742T controller, the ARC
name in the BOOT.INI file would be:

   scsi(0)disk(36)rdisk(0)partition(1)
