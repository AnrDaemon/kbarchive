SUMMARY
=======

When an inventory agent produces an inventory, the Site Server checks for
changes and only pass through inventory data when a four-day timeout occurs,
unless the changes are found outside the Identification Group and Workstation
Status Group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This can result in a machine inventory that only has changed attributes for Last
Hardware Scan or Last Software Scan (indicating a routine scan time and no
changes to the actual inventory). However, this inventory will not be posted to
the database for four days.

This is by design and is intended to minimize the number of delta MIF
transactions. A delta MIF is normally generated by the Inventory Processor each
time it processes a machine inventory. It compares the last time a delta was
forwarded to Inventory Dataloader to its four-day timer, and may block redundant
deltas. For this reason, even if machine name, domain name, or any other item
contained in the Workstation Status or Identification groups have changed, it
takes four days for these changes to posted in the database (assuming a
logon/inventory is made each day.)

A machine may not appear to have its Last Hardware Scan or Last Software Scan
times up to date with the last time an inventory was actually taken. If you want
greater accuracy, and are willing to accept increased system overhead, modify
the following registry entry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components
      \SMS_INVENTORY_PROCESSOR\Inventory Update Reporting Interval (Days).

The default is 4 days, the minimum value is 1 day.
