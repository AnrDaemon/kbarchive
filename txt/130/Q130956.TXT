TITLE   :PRB: MFC DB Classes Don't Update NULL Field Values to Non-NULL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MFC Database classes that come with Visual C++ version 2.0 are used,
any field that has a NULL value cannot be updated to a non-NULL value
successfully.

After opening a recordset on a SQL Server table that has fields with NULL values,
the Edit() and Update() methods of the recordset fail to update the value of the
field to a non-NULL value. For example, the following code isn't able to do the
update:

      CMyRecordSet rs;
      rs.Open();
      rs.Edit();
      rs.m_Name="Test"; //m_Name allows NULLs and is NULL for current record
      rs.Update();

The Update() function doesn't return any error, but the m_Name value is still set
to NULL.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the MFC Database Classes that come with Visual C++ version 2.1 or above.
Otherwise, for the field to be updated, force the bNull flag of the
SetFieldNull() method to FALSE before calling the Update(). The following code
works:

      CMyRecordSet rs;
      rs.Open();
      rs.Edit();
      rs.m_Name="Test";  //m_Name allows NULLs and is NULL for current record
      rs.SetFieldNull(&rs.m_Name, FALSE);
      rs.Update();

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
