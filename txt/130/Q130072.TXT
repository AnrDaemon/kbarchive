======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Net Watcher shows all users who browse a Windows 95 computer as being connected
to all user-level-security shared folders, even if those users have not been
given access rights to any of the shared folders.

Note that this behavior occurs only if the Windows 95 computer has been
configured to use File and Print Sharing for NetWare Networks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

File and Print Sharing for NetWare Networks (NWSERVER) does not understand the
client's drive mappings and there is no NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) that can
obtain the list of directory handles for a random session. Also, even if an NCP
method existed, users can open a directory handle on an NCP share on which they
do not have any rights (although they cannot view the contents of the share).
Net Watcher shows these users as being connected to shares to which they have no
access rights.
