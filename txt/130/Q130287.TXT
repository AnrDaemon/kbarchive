SUMMARY
=======

When you install Microsoft Word for Windows NT, Word makes available to Windows
95 a spell-checking tool that you can access by clicking Options on the Tools
menu. By default, all the options for the spell-checking tool are disabled.

The options for spell-checking in Word for Windows NT are:

 - Always suggest replacements for misspelled words.

 - Always check spelling before sending.

You can select certain words for the spell-checking tool to ignore:

 - Words in uppercase letters.

 - Words with numbers.

 - The original text in a reply or forward.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange for Windows 95 does not include a spell-checking tool.
However, Microsoft Exchange can use any 32-bit spell-checking tool that is
correctly registered. Microsoft Exchange cannot use 16-bit spell-checking tools
unless they are written specifically for Microsoft Exchange.

The Microsoft Mail client also does not supply a spell-checking tool, but it can
use any correctly registered spell-checking tool.
