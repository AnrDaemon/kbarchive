TITLE   :PRB: Default Values Not Checked for Integrity by Visual FoxPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you provide a default value property for a field in a Visual FoxPro table,
Visual FoxPro does not check to see if the default value passes the field
validation rule.

RESOLUTION
==========

The developer should be sure that the default value property for a field does
not violate the field validation rules.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ensuring that field default values do not violate field validation rules is the
responsibility of the programmer.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new database and table.

2. Add a new field (named nfld1, type numeric, width 4).

3. As a Validation rule, type:

   " IIF(nfld1 > 100, .T., .F.) " (without the quotation marks)

4. As a Default Value, type:

   " 99 " (without the quotation marks)

5. Save the table structure, and append a new record to the table. An error
   occurs because the default value 99 violates the validation rule that nfld1
   must be greater than 100.
