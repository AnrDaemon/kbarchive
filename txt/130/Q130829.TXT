TITLE   :"Bad Command or Filename" Starting Program with DOSSHELL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run DOSSHELL in a Windows 95 MS-DOS command prompt session, you receive
the following error message when you try to start a program from DOSSHELL:

   Bad Command or Filename

CAUSE
=====

The version of COMMAND.COM included with Windows 95 is incompatible with
DOSSHELL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs because DOSSHELL calls the executable program file as a 9.3
filename, which COMMAND.COM truncates to an 8.3 filename and processes. The
version of COMMAND.COM that is included with Windows 95 cannot perform this
particular truncation.

This problem does not occur if you have configured your computer so that you can
boot a previous operating system and you boot your computer to this previous
operating system and run DOSSHELL.
