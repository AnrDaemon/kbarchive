TITLE   :System Management Server Setup Limits Path of Devices
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a primary site, Systems Management Server Setup limits the
length of the path for the location of the database and log devices. The text
field for the path does not scroll and the computer beeps when the limit is
reached. The total number of characters allowed for the path depends on the
width of the character used (and may be fewer than 40 characters).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create the database and log devices using the
Microsoft SQL Administrator utility. This method requires the user specifies
only the database device name and the log device name, rather than the full path
of the database and log devices.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in System Management Server version
1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version 1.1.
