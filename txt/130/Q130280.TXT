KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change your Domain password in the Control Panel Network tool, you may
receive the following error message:

   Network Driver Error 7210

Although you receive no confirmation, your Domain password is changed
successfully.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if no password list (<username>.PWL) file exists and
there is not an entry in the [Password Lists] section in the SYSTEM.INI file for
the user who is logged in. Windows for Workgroups changes the Domain password,
but generates the error message stated above when it tries to update the .PWL
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To create a .PWL file, quit Windows for Workgroups and then restart it. When you
are notified that there is no .PWL file, choose Yes to create a new one.

MORE INFORMATION
================


If you do have a .PWL file but it is missing or damaged, you receive the
following error message:

   The specified file could not be updated

Try increasing the values specified in the FILES= entry in the CONFIG.SYS file
and then restart your computer. When you log on to Windows for Workgroups, a new
password list will be created.
