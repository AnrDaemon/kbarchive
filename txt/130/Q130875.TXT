SUMMARY
=======

This article provides basic troubleshooting tips for configuring the Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) with Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Troubleshooting Tips and Techniques
-----------------------------------

1. Clean boot your computer by removing terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
   programs, and third party utilities from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
   configuration files. Remove or minimize the use of memory managers. Add back
   functionality until you discover the utility or combination of utilities that
   is creating undesirable effects.

2. Verify that the clients PROTCOL.INI and SYSTEM.INI files reflect your
   configuration. For more information:

    - See section 16: Network Settings in SYSTEM.INI of the README.TXT file in
      the Microsoft Network Client directory.

    - Check the online help available in SETUP.EXE. Use the F1 key to get
      clarification on a specific option.

    - Query in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for the name of your specific
      network interface card (NIC).

3. Force Microsoft Network Client to recreate the hidden DHCP configuration file
   (DHCP.PRM):

   a. Use the ATTRIB command to remove the hidden and read-only file attributes.

   b. Delete the file.

   c. Quit and restart Microsoft Network Client to allow the file to be
      recreated.

   The client automatically creates the DHCP.PRM (a hidden binary file) in the
   installation directory.

4. Verify the IP is functioning correctly by using PING, NET VIEW, NET CONFIG,
   and NET DIAG on the client.

   For more information see:

    - The on-line help available for each command by typing "/?" (without the
      quotation marks). For example:

   NET VIEW /?

      For PING help, type the command without any parameters.

    - The README.TXT file in the Microsoft Network Client directory. Check the
      table of contents for sections that pertain to your specific installation.

Troubleshooting Utilities
-------------------------

You can run IPCONFIG on the client computer to check the client's IP
configuration.

For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q94069 Microsoft TCP/IP Protocol Comparison and FAQ

   Q123285 IPCONFIG Displays Invalid Results

   Q130538 DHCP-Enabled MS-DOS Clients Do Not Resolve Host Names

You can run DHCPADMN on the Windows NT Server to check the DHCP Server
Configuration. Use the Scope Active Leases option to verify that leasing is
occurring. For more information see:

 - The Microsoft Windows NT Server TCP/IP manual, Chapter 4, Installing and
   Configuring DHCP Servers.

 - Q169289 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Basics

Troubleshooting Resources
-------------------------

 - Check the Microsoft Windows NT Server Comprehensive Index for information on
   Clients.

 - Review the Readme.txt file in the Microsoft Network Client installation
   directory.

 - Additional information may be available in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
   Query on the following words:

   DHCP and CLIENT and PRODTCP32 and 3.0
