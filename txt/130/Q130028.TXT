KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT Server Tools on a Windows for Workgroups version
3.11 computer and attempt to administer a Windows NT Server using any one of the
Server Tools, the following error message may appear:

   The remote procedure call failed and did not execute.

   Do you want to select another Domain to Administer?

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you must modify the Registry on the remote Windows NT
Server.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters

3. Find the following:

      Value Name:   SizReqBuf
      Data Type:    REG_DWORD

4. If the value exists, change the data to a number larger than the default data
   of 4356 (decimal).

   If the value does not exist:

   a. From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

   b. Enter the information above.

   c. For the data, enter a number larger than the default data.

5. Quit Registry Editor.

6. Either shutdown and restart Windows NT, or from a command prompt, type the
   following commands (pressing ENTER after each line):

   net stop server
   net start server
   net start netlogon (if the Netlogon service has not started)

You must also update your Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 client with the
files located in the \CLIENTS\WFW\UPDATE subdirectory on the Windows NT Server
version 3.5 CD-ROM as follows:

1. Close Windows for Workgroups

2. From MS-DOS, copy the following files to your Windows root directory (this is
   C:\WINDOWS by default):

      NET.EXE       450,262   09/04/94   08:07a

3. From MS-DOS, copy the following files to your Windows System directory (this
   is C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM by default):

      NDIS.386       27,846   09/04/94   08:07a
      NETAPI.DLL    109,120   09/04/94   08:07a
      NWNBLINK.386   37,964   09/04/94   08:07a
      VNETSUP.386    14,647   09/04/94   08:07a
      VREDIR.386     85,746   09/04/94   08:07a
