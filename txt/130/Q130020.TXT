PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0

KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a message, attachments in the message appear with the icon from
the application from the sender's computer. This is true whether or not the
receiver has the application installed on the workstation.

For example, if a message is sent to you with a Microsoft Excel attachment, and
you do not have Microsoft Excel installed on your machine, the icon in the
message will display as an Microsoft Excel icon.

CAUSE
=====

This is expected behavior.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The recipient will see the icon that the sender has associated with the file.
Normally, the icons will display in the recipient messages according to the
parent applications on the sender computer. However, if the sender associates an
.XLS file with Microsoft Word for Windows, then forwards the file, the recipient
may see a Word for Windows icon in the message.


Additional query words: picture incorrect
