TITLE   :PRB: Double-click in File Manager Starts Wrong FoxPro Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an .APP file is started from a program icon or by double-clicking in File
Manager, Visual FoxPro is invoked instead of FoxPro for Windows and Visual
FoxPro fails.

When a FoxPro version 2.x .APP file is invoked from Visual FoxPro, Visual FoxPro
fails and displays this error message:

   Object file "<Drive:\Pathname\file.app" was compiled in a previous version
   of FoxPro.

When you click OK, you remain in the Visual FoxPro interactive development
environment.

CAUSE
=====

When Visual FoxPro is installed, the .APP file extension is automatically
associated with Visual FoxPro, not FoxPro for Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use any one of the following three possible solutions. The first applies to
Windows NT, and the second and third apply to any Windows platform.

 - Using REGEDT32 in Windows NT, revise the software hive entry of
   HKEY_Local_Machine under Software, Classes, APP from the value of
   Visual.FoxPro.Application.3 to MSFoxPro. Be careful when using the Registry
   Editor.

-or-

 - In the File Manager, select any FoxPro version 2.x .APP file. Then choose
   Associate from the File menu. In the Associate dialog box, associate the
   files with the .APP extension to Microsoft FoxPro for Windows. Click the OK
   button, and the registry will be automatically updated. Attempting to change
   the association in any other fashion causes a general protection (GP) fault
   in the File Manager.

-or-

 - Revise your application icons to have a fully-qualified path that invokes
   your application. A sample command line for an application might be something
   like this:

   C:\FPW26\FOXPROW.EXE INVOICES.APP

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
