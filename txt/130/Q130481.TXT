PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers that use CMD Technology's PCI0640x IDE controller chip to control
devices on both IDE channels may stop responding (hang) or experience data loss
when running Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 without CMD Technology's Windows NT 3.5
driver. This problem does not occur on computers with only one IDE channel.

The CMD PCI-0640x IDE controller chip set can be identified on the motherboard by
looking for a LSI chip that has the CMD logo and labeled PCI- 0640x x=A,B,... It
is near the connectors used to attach the IDE drives.

The following computers contain this chip:

   AMI Atlas PCI
   AST Bravo MS-T P/75
   Asus tek 90mhz
   AT&T Globalyst 360, 380, 620, and 630
   Dell Optiplex 90
   Dell Optiplex XMT 5120
   Digital (DEC) Starion 700i
   DEC (Digital) Venturis 466
   HP vectra VL series 3
   Micron P5-90
   Micron P5-100
   NEC Image P90


RESOLUTION
==========

Substitute CMD Technology's Windows NT 3.5 driver for the Enhanced IDE driver
supplied with Windows NT. CMD's Windows NT 3.5 driver may be downloaded from CMD
Technology's bulletin board system. The BBS number is (714) 454-1134. Look for
the file 640XNT35.ZIP. Users also may obtain the driver from their reseller.

Microsoft has modified the Windows NT version 3.51 file, ATAPI.SYS, to correct
this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. A fix to this problem for version 3.51 is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft
does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
