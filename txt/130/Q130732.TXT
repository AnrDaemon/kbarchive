SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a data source to access Microsoft Excel
files by using ODBC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the data source setup dialog box, specify the version of the Microsoft Excel
file that you want to connect. If it is a Microsoft Excel version 5.0 file, you
also need to specify the name of the workbook. The workbook in Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 files is analogous to the Visual FoxPro database, and the Microsoft
Excel worksheet is analogous to the Visual FoxPro table.

If you specify a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or 3.0 file, you must also specify
the directory where the file is located. In this case, the directory is
analogous to the Visual FoxPro database, and the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
are analogous to the Visual FoxPro table.
