TITLE   :Problems Using Saved Colors with 256-Color Bitmap
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Microsoft Paint, you cannot use a palette that you saved with
the Save Colors command to edit a 256-color bitmap. If you load the saved
palette with the Get Colors command, choose a color from the saved palette, then
use that color to edit the 256-color bitmap, the color that appears is different
than the color you chose.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Note that the Get Colors command may be unavailable on the Options menu in Paint
if you are using a 256-color palette. This occurs because the 256- color palette
is fixed and cannot accommodate new colors. If your system supports more than
256 colors, follow these steps to enable the Get Colors command:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.

2. Click the Settings tab.

3. In the Color Palette box, click a setting with more than 256 colors.

   NOTE: If your system does not support more than 256 colors, you will not be
   able to select a higher setting.

4. Click OK.

After you make this change, you may still experience the symptoms described in
this article.
