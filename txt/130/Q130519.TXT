KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 cannot communicate with a Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) 3.11- based
computer configured to use Microsoft Windows Network (version 3.11), Novell
NetWare (Workstation Shell 3.x), and IPX Support Driver (Monolithic) with
NetBIOS support.

CAUSE
=====

By default, Windows 95 does not enable NetBIOS support for the IPX/SPX protocol.
Therefore, Windows 95 uses direct hosting for the IPX/SPX protocol, preventing
communication with a WFWG 3.11-based computer configured for monolithic IPX
(which cannot use direct hosting).

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

To disable direct hosting in Windows 95, add a new string value named DirectHost
to the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Vxd\VNETSUP

Set the value for the DirectHost string value to 0.

To enable NetBIOS support for the IPX/SPX protocol on a Windows 95-based computer
so that it can communicate with WFWG 3.11-based computers using monolithic IPX,
follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. On the Configuration tab, click IPX/SPX-Compatible Protocol, and then click
   Properties.

3. On the NetBIOS tab, click the "I want to enable NetBIOS over IPX/SPX" check
   box to select it.

4. Click OK, and then click OK.

5. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.
