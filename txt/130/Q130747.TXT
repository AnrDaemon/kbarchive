PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Windows Products
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose the Task Manager button to close applications during the
installation of the Microsoft Windows Sound System, your computer beeps and does
not open the Task Manager program specified in the [BOOT] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows Sound System tries to open TASKMAN.EXE from the Windows directory
instead of using the TASKMAN= line in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
to locate the Task Manager program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the TASKMAN.EXE file is present in the Windows directory, or
press CTRL+ESC to load the task manager specified in the SYSTEM.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install the Windows Sound System, Setup prompts you to close all other
applications before continuing. Setup displays a Task Manager button so that you
can use Task Manager to close the other applications. However, choosing this
button does not open the task manager specified in the SYSTEM.INI file. Instead,
Setup tries to load the TASKMAN.EXE file from the Windows directory. If this
file is not present, your computer beeps and Task Manager is not loaded.
