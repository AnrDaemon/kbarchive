SUMMARY
=======

The following information concerning the use of Flight Simulator Version 4.00 in
multi-player mode is taken from the README.DOC file:

Multi-Player Information:
-------------------------

If you are not using a Hayes-compatible modem, select Option 1 (ON-LINE), then
deselect Option 1 prior to selecting Option 3 (Messages/Talk to Modem). Turning
Option 1 on and off has the effect of initializing the COM port buffer, and
should be done before you "Talk to Modem" without prior selection of "DIAL" or
"Wait for Ring" options.

If you are using a joystick, you may have problems running Multi-Player at a high
baud rate (19,200 baud or higher), particularly in sending and receiving
aircraft. If you are using a joystick, it is best to set your baud rate no
higher than 9,600.

In Multi-Player, a baud rate of 57,600 is supported, but is not recommended. Its
advantage is faster aircraft send/receive and messages, but it has no effect
upon the smoothness of the other player's flight and can degrade system
performance.

When sending messages, limit the length of the message to what is displayed in
the message box.

When using the Sailplane in Multi-Player, the ADF tracking feature is not
available due to the reduced Sailplane instrumentation.

Multi-Player supports two players, not "two or more" as noted on Page 132 of the
"Microsoft Flight Simulator" manual.
