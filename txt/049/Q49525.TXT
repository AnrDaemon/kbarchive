SUMMARY
=======

If you cannot stop the server or workstation services for the server local
console ("access denied" messages), this is because of the strengthening of
security in OS/2 LAN Manager versions 2.x over earlier releases.

If you are in user-mode security (security = user in LANMAN.INI), you should do
the following to stop the server or workstation:

1. Log off and immediately log on again, but this time use a user name that is
   defined as an account with ADMIN privileges for the machine on which you want
   to stop the server or workstation.

2. If you need information on how to define a new user name as an account name
   that has ADMIN privileges for the machine on which you want to stop the
   server or workstation.

If you are in share-mode security (security = share in LANMAN.INI), you should do
the following to stop the server or workstation:

1. Reboot the machine, and before the workstation or server is started, rename
   C:\LANMAN\ACCOUNTS\NET.ACC to C:\LANMAN\ACCOUNTS\NETACC.SAV.

2. If necessary, before rebooting the machine, edit STARTUP.CMD or other .CMD
   files that automatically start the workstation or server. You can press
   CTRL+C to halt execution of STARTUP.CMD if that is appropriate in your
   situation.
