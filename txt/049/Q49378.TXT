SUMMARY
=======

The CodeView debugger Search menu includes a Label command to search for a
label. Unlike the Find command, which searches in the source code for any
regular expression, the Label command searches the CodeView debugging
information for an assembly language label.

This search is not a text search and does not support regular expressions. To
find a label, specify the name of the label as the search string. In addition,
if the Case Sense option is selected in the Options menu, the label is found
only if the case of each letter matches exactly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, to find the code for the standard C stack-checking function
"_chkstk", choose Label from the Search menu, type "__chkstk" (without the
quotation marks), and press ENTER. CodeView switches the display to assembly
language mode, if it was not already, and positions the line with the label
__chkstk at the top of the window. Two underscores are required because C
prepends an underscore to every label (the original function name is
"_chkstk").

If the label is not available, or if you type it in incorrectly, CodeView returns
an "Unknown Symbol" error. For example, "_chkstk" "chkstk" "__chk" and
"__chkstks" each fail to match the example above. If Case Sense is on, an
attempt to find the label "__CHKSTK" also fails.
