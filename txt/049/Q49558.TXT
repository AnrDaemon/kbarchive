TITLE   :Err Msg: "Cannot Find FSHELPER File"

SUMMARY
=======

Question:

Why is the following error message displayed when I try to start OS/2 LAN Manager
version 2.x?

   SYS1718: The system cannot find the file "FSHELPER" specified in the DEVICE
   command on line 39 of the CONFIG.SYS file.
   Line 39 ignored.

Response:

This message is displayed because either the NETWKSTA.SYS line in your CONFIG.SYS
file starts with "DEVICE=" or you have multiple NETWKSTA.SYS lines in your
CONFIG.SYS file.

If you have only one line in your CONFIG.SYS file for NETWKSTA.SYS that starts
with "IFS=", this error message will not be displayed.

For example, your CONFIG.SYS file may contain two NETWKSTA.SYS lines similar to
the lines listed below:

   device=c:\lanman\netprog\netwksta.sys /i:c:\lanman
   ifs=c:\lanman\netprog\netwksta.sys /i:c:\lanman

If it does, change these lines to the following:

   rem device=c:\lanman\netprog\netwksta.sys /i:c:\lanman
   ifs=c:\lanman\netprog\netwksta.sys /i:c:\lanman

Or, the message may be displayed because your CONFIG.SYS file has one line for
NETWKSTA.SYS, such as the one listed below:

   device=c:\lanman\netprog\netwksta.sys /i:c:\lanman

If it does, change this line to the following:

   ifs=c:\lanman\netprog\netwksta.sys /i:c:\lanman

As always, you can use any combination of uppercase and lowercase characters in
the CONFIG.SYS entries.

The reason for starting the line with "IFS=" instead of "DEVICE=" is that
NETWKSTA.SYS in OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.x must be installed as an IFS
(Installable File System) instead of as a device driver. This is a change from
earlier releases of OS/2 LAN Manager, in which NETWKSTA.SYS is always installed
as a device driver.
