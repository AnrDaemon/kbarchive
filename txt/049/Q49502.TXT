PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, versions 1.01, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for OS/2, versions 1.01, 1.11, 1.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the NMAKE utility processes a makefile, even though no warnings occur and
the compiler appears to execute properly, no OBJ or EXE file is created. When
the MAKE utility processes the same makefile, the following messages appear on
the screen:

   warning U4000: Target does not exist.
   warning U4001: Dependent does not exist; Target not built.

NMAKE may generate the following

   warning D4021 : no action performed

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when extra characters appear at the end of a line in the
makefile.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the makefile to remove the unexpected trailing characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following makefile demonstrates this problem. To address this problem,
remove the semicolon from the end of the CL command.

Sample Makefile
---------------

file.obj: file.c    # Error: do not use semicolon with CL command
   CL /c /Lp file.c;

file.exe: file.obj  # OK: LINK command accepts semicolon
   LINK file;

Additional query words: 1.20 1.30 1.40
