SUMMARY
=======

In Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00, the spot plane doesn't recognize the
aircraft carrier.

If an airplane has landed on the deck of the aircraft carrier, the spot plane
does recognize the aircraft carrier if the spot plane is set to an altitude of
less than the aircraft altitude. The spot plane is looking at the bottom of the
airplane, from a position within the unseen aircraft carrier.

To set the spot plane altitude, press 2 for VIEWS menu, D for "SET UP SPOT
PLANE...", and 2 for "ALTITUDE:". At the prompt, enter a value that is greater
than the altitude of the aircraft (the altitude of the airplane is listed on the
altimeter). The spot plane can now see the airplane on the deck of the aircraft
carrier.
