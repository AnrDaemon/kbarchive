The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1

SUMMARY
=======

The macro example on Page Update-23 in the "Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.1:
Updates and Microsoft Editor" has an error in it. The macro in the example is
called RestRegs.

The current example reads as follows:

         RestRegs    MACRO
            numloc   instr  regpushed,"#"
               .
               .
               .
                     ENDM

The second line should read as follows:

            numloc  instr  regpushed,<#>

However, even with this correction made to the example this macro will not work
correctly on MASM version 5.1. This example does not work correctly on MASM
version 5.1 due to a problem with the SUBSTR directive when assigning a string a
substring of itself.

Additional query words: 5.10
