The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The TREE and XCOPY utilities cannot detect subdirectories that have any of the
following attributes: read-only, system, hidden, or archive.

In order for a subdirectory to be recognized by TREE or XCOPY, all of it's
attributes must be removed. The MS-DOS Attribute command (ATTRIB) can apply and
remove any of the four attributes for files and subdirectories.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With some subdirectories, it is more desirable to have them ignored by the TREE
and XCOPY commands. One example of this is the \DELETED subdirectory created by
the Microsoft MEP Editor to hold archived versions of edited files.

Please note that this limitation applies only to subdirectories that TREE or
XCOPY must search for, not subdirectories that are specified on the command
line.
