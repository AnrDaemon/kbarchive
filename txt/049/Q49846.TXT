SUMMARY
=======

When you select a propulsion-source of "none" during aircraft design in Flight
Simulator Version 4.00, the sailplane is the default configuration. You will
notice that some options that are not applicable to the sailplane can still be
changed (i.e., gear, fuel, capacity, and power).

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
