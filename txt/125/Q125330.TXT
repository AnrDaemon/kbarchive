TITLE   :CONN: Messages Stop Moving Between AppleTalk and PC Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER::1.0,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages stop moving through the Mail Connection gateway from Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks to Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. The messages begin to
queue up; however, the log file does not show new mail being picked up.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by a stuck or corrupted message in the Microsoft Mail
Data file on the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the stuck messages using the Mail Network Administrator. From the Admin
menu, choose Queued Mail. View the list by date and delete the oldest message.

NOTE: The "View by Date" option is only available with the Mail Network
Administrator included with version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks. If you are using Mail 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1b, or 3.1c, you may have to delete
all messages queued because the messages are sorted in the list by size only and
it is difficult to ascertain which message is the oldest.
