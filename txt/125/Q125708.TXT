======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a file in an application, you cannot give the file any extension
other than that application's default extension. For example, when you specify
the filename FILENAME.EXT for a file in Notepad, the file is saved as
FILENAME.EXT.TXT.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design for any application that uses the common dialog boxes
(such as the Save As dialog box). This behavior is generally desirable because
it lets you see the appropriate files for the application you are using when you
use the common Open dialog box to open files.

Note that if the extension you specify when you are saving a file is a registered
file type in Windows, an application that uses the common dialog boxes will not
append its default extension to the filename you specify. For example, you can
specify an .INI extension for a file that you save in Notepad because files with
an .INI extension are associated with the Notepad application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To save a file with an extension that is not registered as a file type in
Windows, place quotation marks around the filename. To save a file with the
filename FILENAME.EXT, enter

   "FILENAME.EXT" (with quotation marks)

in the Save As dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you save files with a particular extension frequently, you may want to create
a registered file type for that extension. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. On the View menu, click Options.

3. Click the File Types tab.

4. Click the New Type button.

5. Type a description and extension in the Description Of Type and Associated
   Extensions boxes.

6. Click the New button.

7. In the Action box, type the action to be performed by the application
   associated with the new file type. For example, type "open" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Action box.

8. In the Application Used To Perform Action box, type the complete path and
   filename of the application associated with the new file type.

9. Click the OK button. In the Add New File Type dialog box, click OK. In the
   Options dialog box, click OK.
