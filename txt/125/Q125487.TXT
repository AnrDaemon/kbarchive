SYMPTOMS
========

After dumping the Systems Management Server database and transaction log to a
dump device and then restoring it to a different database and log device, either
on the same SQL Server computer or a different one, the Systems Management
Server Administrator program cannot retrieve the list of machines in a domain
and the following errors appear in the Data Loader log file, Datalodr.log:

      CMachine::FindMachine - Searching for matching Identification group info

      CMachine::FindMachine - Query Execution failed

These errors also appear in the Hierarchy Manager log file, Hman.log:

      {818} ERROR SQL: General SQL Server error:
                       Check messages from the SQL Server.

      {825} INFO SQL:  Can't allocate space for object 'Syslogs' in database
                       'xxx' because the 'logsegment' segment is full. If you
                       ran out of space in Syslogs, dump the transaction log.
                       Otherwise, use ALTER DATABASE or sp_extendsegment to
                       increase the size of the segment.

(where xxx is the Systems Management Server database name)

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur because the Transaction Log for the Systems Management Server
database is full and SQL Server can no longer log transactions to it. When
Systems Management Server originally created the database it enables the
Truncate Log On Checkpoint option. When the database is dumped and then restored
to a new device, that option is not set by default, therefore, the Transaction
Log is never truncated and eventually fills up.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Dump the Transaction log using the No Log option.

2. Set the Truncate Log On Checkpoint option for the Systems Management Server
   database.

For more information, refer to the "Microsoft SQL Administrator User's Guide" and
the "Microsoft SQL Server Troubleshooting Guide."
