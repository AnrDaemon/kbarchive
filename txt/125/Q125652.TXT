KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbMaintMan smsmaintman

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a NetWare domain to a site, the data associated with the Network
Interface Card (NIC) ID attribute information for the NetWare server is
incorrect. This data is not the NIC address, as it is for Windows NT servers.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
