SUMMARY
=======

SMS Administrator can log its activities to a log file (a process known as
tracing). By default, tracing is turned on for SMS Administrator, but the log
file does not get created until SQL Server tracing is turned on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To turn on SQL Server tracing:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT or Microsoft SMS to
correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   subtree.

2. Go to the following subkey:

      \SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\SMS\TRACING

3. From the parameter list, select SqlEnabled.

4. From the Edit menu, choose DWORD.

5. In the Data field, change the value from 0 to 1 and then choose OK.

6. To verify that tracing is enabled for the SMS Administrator User Interface,
   go to the following HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key:

      \SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\SMS\TRACING\SMS_USER_INTERFACE

   The parameter Enabled should be set to 1.

7. Exit and restart SMS Administrator (SMS.EXE).

A UI.LOG file is created in the SMS\LOGS directory. The log file can be viewed
using SMS Tracer (SMSTRACE.EXE). For more information on using SMS Tracer, query
