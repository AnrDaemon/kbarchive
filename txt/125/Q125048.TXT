-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running Encarta 1995 under Microsoft Windows NT operating system
version 3.5, you may receive the following error message when you exit the
program:

   Application Error
   Encart95 caused an exception in the Win16 Subsystem

   Click on CLOSE to terminate the application
   Click on CANCEL to debug the application
   Click on IGNORE to continue, you should save your work in a new file.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you have selected the Run In Separate Memory Space option
for Encarta in the Properties dialog box in Program Manager.

If you choose Close or Ignore, Encarta is closed, but your system may be
unstable. If you choose Cancel, you receive the following message:

   The instruction at "0x00000023" referenced memory at 0x3bd90f06. The memory
   could not be "read".
   Click on OK to terminate the application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do not use Run In Separate Memory Space when you run
Encarta 1995.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Run In Separate Memory Space option is used only with Windows 3.1 (16- bit)
applications in Microsoft Windows NT. It is used to run a Windows 3.1
application in a separate memory space from other Windows 3.1 applications.

This option protects other Windows 3.1 applications if the application stops
responding (hangs), but it does use more memory. Use this option only if the
application you are running stops responding (hangs) regularly.
