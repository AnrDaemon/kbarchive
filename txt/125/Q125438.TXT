TITLE   :Network Icon in Control Panel Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click the Network icon in Control Panel, an hourglass appears
and immediately disappears, but the Network dialog box is not displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you have an old or damaged WFWNET.DRV file in either
the Windows directory or the Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. If there is a WFWNET.DRV file in the Windows directory, rename it to some
   other name (such as WFWNET.OLD).

2. If there is a WFWNET.DRV file in the Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory, rename it
   to some other name (such as WFWNET.OLD).

3. If your original Windows for Workgroups disks are 3.5-inch, 1.44 MB disks,
   insert disk 7 in the appropriate disk drive. If your disks are 5.25-inch, 1.2
   MB disks, insert disk 8 in the appropriate disk drive.

4. Type the following line at an MS-DOS command prompt

   expand <fdrive>:\wfwnet.dr_
   <hdrive>:\<windir>\system\wfwnet.drv

   where <fdrive> is the drive containing the original Windows for
   Workgroups disk, <hdrive> is the hard disk where Windows for Workgroups
   is installed, and <windir> is the directory in which Windows for
   Workgroups is installed. For example, if the original Windows for Workgroups
   disk is in drive A, and Windows for Workgroups is installed in the WINDOWS
   directory on drive C, type the following line

   expand a:\wfwnet.dr_ c:\windows\system\wfwnet.drv

   and then press ENTER.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WFWNET.DRV file supplies the network dialog boxes for Windows for
Workgroups. If this file is old or damaged, a Network dialog box will not be
displayed when you choose the Network icon in Control Panel. Network services
will not be affected.
