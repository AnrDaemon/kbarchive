TITLE   :Err Msg: Application Database Cannot Server, Share or Dir...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using Program Group Control (PGC) on a Systems Management Server client,
error message 11114 appears in the SMSLOG.TXT file:

   Application database cannot server, share or directory entries in SMS Profile

This error is ambiguous and does not explain what problem was encountered by PGC.

CAUSE
=====

Error 11114 actually indicates that PGC was unable to read a server, share, or
directory name from the SMS.INI file. This could be caused by a number of
problems like a corrupted file or mismatched [Server] and [Share] sections.

RESOLUTION
==========

The SMS administrator will need to examine the SMS.INI file to determine what
entry is causing the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
