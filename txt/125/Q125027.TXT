SUMMARY
=======

On page 25 of the FoxPro for Macintosh Distribution Kit "User's Guide," step 7
incorrectly refers to a non-existent screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In step 7, under the heading "Making Disk Images", the "User's Guide" states:

   To print a report about the current distribution disk set, choose the PRINT
   push button. To see information about the next distribution disk set, choose
   the CLOSE push button.

This reference is incorrect, as no such screen is ever presented at the
conclusion of the compression and disk image creation process.
