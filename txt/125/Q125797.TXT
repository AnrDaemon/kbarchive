TITLE   :Dell Computer Hangs with ATI Mach 64 ISA Display Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an ATI Mach 64 ISA display adapter in a Dell DE-series computer in
which the onboard VGA adapter has been disabled through the CMOS (not by using
the jumper), the computer may stop responding (hang) during Windows 95 Setup, or
during detection if the ATI adapter is installed after Windows 95 is installed.

This problem can also occur with a Dell Omniplex PCI-series computer. You can
correct this problem on these computers by upgrading the BIOS to revision A10.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 detection searches the ROM area of the computer's memory. The ATI
Mach 64 adapter uses the BFC00 address. During detection, Windows 95 receives
information from the onboard display adapter, causing Windows 95 to hang.


STATUS
======

Dell Computer Corporation is aware of this situation and is researching the
problem. We will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
