TITLE   :Cannot Reconnect With Same IP Address to SLIP Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Remote Access Service (RAS) utility, Remote Access, in Windows NT version
3.5 supports connections to servers that use Serial Line Internet Protocol
(SLIP). If a RAS client makes and breaks a connection to a SLIP server, it can
no longer use the same IP address to reconnect to the SLIP server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unlike PPP, you are unable to configure Windows NT 3.5 RAS to use a specific IP
address from the SLIP server being dialed. The SLIP server will assign the
Windows NT 3.5 RAS client an IP address. Therefore, the RAS client does not have
the capacity to reuse the previous IP address when it attempts to reconnect to
the SLIP server after the initial connection is broken.

Other design constraints involving RAS connections to SLIP servers include the
fact that a terminal interface window will always appear first during the logon
process to the SLIP server. There is no way to disable this feature.
Additionally, the RAS client will not disconnect from the SLIP server until the
SLIP server drops the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal. If the modem through
which RAS is making the SLIP connection does not drop the DCD signal, the RAS
client will not hang up.
