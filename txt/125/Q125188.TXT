TITLE   :Err Msg: CVF Has Been Deleted or Has Been Seriously Damaged
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, you receive the following error message
immediately after the "Starting MS-DOS" message:

   Error: CVF has been deleted or has been seriously damaged

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if you use Symantec's Norton Disk Doctor version
7.0 with the /Q (quick) option. Norton Disk Doctor version 7.0 is compatible
with DoubleSpace, but is not compatible with DriveSpace. If you run Norton Disk
Doctor version 7.0 without the /Q option it can find false problems with the
CVF.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use Norton Disk Doctor version 7.0 with MS-DOS 6.22 and DriveSpace. Using
EDIT.COM, edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and remark the NDD.EXE line. To remark the
line, change it to read:

      REM C:\NU\NDD.EXE /Q

You need a newer version of Norton Utilities in order to run Norton Disk Doctor
with DriveSpace.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to Symantec, Norton Utilities version 8 is compatible with DriveSpace
and will correct problems with the DriveSpace compression structure.


The Norton Utilities and Norton Disk Doctor are manufactured by Symantec
Corporation, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
