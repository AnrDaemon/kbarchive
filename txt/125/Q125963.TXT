TITLE   :IPCONFIG Shows Leftover DHCP Parameters On Non-DHCP Clients
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you configure your TCP/IP-32 client to use DHCP and then re-configure it not
to use DHCP, when you execute the command, "IPCONFIG /ALL", it will show old
(DHCP supplied) values for certain parameters. Although, the client will ignore
these values and use the local configuration, this may be confusing.

Parameters which may appear incorrectly in IPCONFIG include:

 - Primary WINS server

 - Secondary WINS server

 - Node Type

CAUSE
=====

IPCONFIG is looking at values in the hidden file, DHCP.BIN, which is not updated
when the client is switched from being DHCP-configured to manually configured.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the hidden file, DHCP.BIN, found in the
Windows directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32 and TCP/IP-32a. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
