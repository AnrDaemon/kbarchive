The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you use the Windows NT START command to run a program information file
(PIF) from Command Prompt or a batch file, the following error message
appears:

   The name specified is not recognized as in internal or external command,
   operable program or batch file.

The Windows NT Workstation 3.5 System Guide on page 336 (page 342 of the
Windows NT Server 3.5 System Guide) notes that you can start a PIF using
the following command line:

   start <myapp>

where <myapp> is the name of the PIF you wish to run. This only works if
the filename of the PIF is the same as the filename of the application
being called in the PIF. If the name of the PIF is different than the name
of the application being called from the PIF, you need to include the .PIF
extension, as in the following example:

   start myapp.pif

If you fail to include the .PIF extension, you will receive the error
message noted above.
