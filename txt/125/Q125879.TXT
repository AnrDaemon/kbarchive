SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Remote Access Services (RAS) with TCP/IP on a domain
controller or a stand-alone server and then restart your computer, the following
error messages may appear in your event log:

   Event ID: 2504
   Source: Server
   The server could not bind to the transport \device\NetBT_<adapter name>.
   The data is BE 04.


   Event ID: 2144
   Source: Workstation
   The computer name already exists on the network.

Several other events are triggered as a result of these, including Netlogon
failing to start.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if a statically mapped address on a WINS server exists on
the other side of a router.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the static mapping for the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
