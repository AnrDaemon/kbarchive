======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.52 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under the four conditions described in this article, the following compiler
error is generated:

   test.cpp(linenumber) : error C2443: operand size conflict

Here linenumber is the assembly instruction in TEST.CPP file that meets the
following conditions. This error occurs when the following four conditions are
met:

 - You're using inline assembly.

 - The size of the source operand on an assembly instruction is different from
   the size of the destination operand.

 - The source operand is a member of a structure.

 - The PTR operator is used to force the operand to the size required.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using C++, declare a reference variable initialized with the
structure member. Use the reference variable as the source operand in the
assembly instruction as shown in this sample code:

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: /Tp
   */ 

   truct Test
   {

    int  nInt;
   } test1;

   void main(void)
   {
   __asm  mov  bh, BYTE PTR test1.nInt  /* error occurs here */ 

   int & nTest = test1.nInt;   /*  these lines work  */ 

   __asm  mov  bh, BYTE PTR nTest   /*  these lines work  */ 
   }

If you are using C, use a local variable instead of a reference variable.

STATUS
======

This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, version 6.0.
