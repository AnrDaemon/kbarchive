TITLE   :How to Assign IPX Network Numbers to Multiple Network Cards
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

You cannot configure a Windows NT computer through the user interface to
access two different IPX networks on two different network adapters, each
with a different frame type. If you run Control Panel, choose Network,
select each adapter, and assign a network number, the same network number
is used for both network adapters. In order to provide the network number
for each network card, you must modify the Windows NT Registry.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NwlnkIpx\NetConfig\<network card>

   where <network card> is the network card you are configuring for a
   different IPX network.

3. Remove the entry: NetworkNumber

4. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value. Add the following:

   Value Name: NetworkNumber
   Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
   Data: <Network ID>

5. If necessary, repeat steps 2 through 4 for each network adapter.

6. Quit the Registry.

7. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
