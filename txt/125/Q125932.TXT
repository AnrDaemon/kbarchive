TITLE   :Windows NT Help Shows Incorrect Permission Switch for CACLS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows NT Help, if you select Command Reference Help (NTCMDS.HLP) and choose
CACLS, the /P switch lists the following permission (perm) options:

   n - None
   r - Read
   c - Change (write)
   a - All permissions

However, if you specify perm "a" with the CACLS command, the following error
message appears:

   The argument string passed to DosExecPgm is not correct.

CAUSE
=====

The Command Reference Help file references the permission options of the CACLS
command incorrectly.

WORKAROUND
==========

The perm options should show as the following:

   n - None
   r - Read
   c - Change (write)
   f - Full control

NOTE: The correct perm options can be viewed by typing the following at the
MS-DOS Command Prompt:

   CACLS /H

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
