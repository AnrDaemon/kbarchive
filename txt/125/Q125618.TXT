TITLE   :Problem with Display Warning when Using Non-US Language
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following message appears when you start the Display portion of Control
Panel after you change systems language settings and restart Windows NT:

   WARNING!

   There are no font selections available for your currently selected language
   setting. Font selections are only available for the English (Americain)
   language. Use the International option in Control Panel to change your
   language setting.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run the International portion of Control Panel and change the language
   setting to anything other than English (American).

2. Choose OK. Notice that there is no message indicating that a shutdown and
   restart must occur before changes can take place. You are simply returned to
   Control Panel.

3. Exit Control Panel.

4. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.

5. Run the Display portion of Control Panel and note the warning message
   referenced above. Notice that "American" is misspelled "Americain" in the
   warning message.

Summary of Problems in this Bug and Causes
------------------------------------------

1. Changes made to language settings don't take effect until the system is
   shutdown and restarted, but there is no message indicating this.

   Cause: The current release of Windows NT does not take this fact into account.

2. You can only use small fonts when selecting other English-based locales, such
   as English (Australian); otherwise, when you use large fonts you get the
   above warning message after changing locales.

   Cause: The current release of Windows NT contains only small font support for
   locales other than English (American).

3. "American" is misspelled (see step 5 above).

   Cause: Typographical error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
