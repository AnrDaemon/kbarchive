======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run MMFCLEAN.EXE, the system you are running it on can lock up or hang.
You will also receive the following error message:

   MMFCLEAN.EXE has stopped responding to the system.

CAUSE
=====

In the first step of the MMFCLEAN.EXE procedure, it creates a TEMP file
(~mmf.tmp), which is a copy of the MMF file that it is attempting to clean. If
the program is halted in any way, the TEMP MMF will not get deleted. Trying to
run MMFCLEAN.EXE again may cause the system to lock up or hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

The resolution is to delete the offending TEMP files from the MAILDATA\MMF
directory, and MMFCLEAN should work.

NOTE: Insufficient disk space on the postoffice can also cause the system to
lock-up or hang without warning or error message.
