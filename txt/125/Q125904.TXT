TITLE   :Client Data is Corrupted When Written to an NTFS Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Files created on an NTFS server volume by a network client may contain zeros
(NULs) in place of the data the client software intended to write. The client
software may not immediately detect that the data has been corrupted if the
client is using caching. Looking at the file from the server or from another
client will show that the file contains zeros.

This problem occurs very infrequently and requires extensive file creation to
reproduce. Only one corrupted file was encountered in one a test machine when
30,000 files were created during heavy disk activity.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a File Allocation Table (FAT) or a High
Performance File System (HPFS) partition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
