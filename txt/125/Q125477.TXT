TITLE   :Windows NT Workstation Broadcasts to LAN Manager 2.x Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You do not have the option in Windows NT Workstation to configure the
Server service in Network section of Control Panel. Therefore, you cannot
use Control Panel Network to select "Make Browser Broadcasts to LAN Manager
2.x Clients."

If you need your Windows NT Workstation's computer name to show up in
LAN Manager 2.x client browse lists, modify the Lmannounce value in the
Registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\Lmannounce

3. Select Lmannounce.

4. The default Lmannounce value is 0. Change it to 1 to enable browser
   broadcasts to LAN Manager 2.x clients.

5. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.

It may take 15 minutes or more (depending on the size and complexity of
your network) before all LAN Manager clients see the Windows NT workstation
in their browse lists.
