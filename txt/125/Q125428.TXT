SUMMARY
=======

To make backup copies of your original Microsoft Fine Artist or Creative Writer
for the Macintosh disks, you must use a third-party disk copying utility.

If you try to make backup copies of the original disks by copying the files from
the original disks to blank disks, you will not be able to run Setup from the
backup disks.


MORE INFORMATION
================

A utility called DiskCopy, available from your Apple dealer, can make backup
copies of the Fine Artist and Creative Writer disks. Please contact your Apple
dealer for more information about the DiskCopy utility.
