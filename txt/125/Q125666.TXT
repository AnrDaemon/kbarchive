TITLE   :Noncritical Error Opening RPLSVC.MDB for Remoteboot Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Remoteboot Service from the Windows NT Server version 3.5
CD, the following error message appears:

   Noncritical Error
   An error has occurred.
   Unable to open the file x:\i386\rplsvc.mdb

   A non-critical error has occurred. You may try the operation, ignore it, or
   exit the entire Setup operation.

This error occurs 58% through the installation process.

CAUSE
=====

There are three prompts during the installation procedure for the administrator
to enter paths for Remoteboot files. The third prompt requests the path for the
Remoteboot Client files; the default path is incorrect. Accepting the default
path results in the error referenced above.

To avoid the error message noted above, change the path to
<drive>:\CLIENTS\RPL (where <drive> is the drive with the Remoteboot
installation files).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Exit Setup

2. Reinstall the Remoteboot program.

3. When you are prompted to enter the path for the Remoteboot Client files, type
   the following

   <drive>:\Clients\Rpl

   where <drive> is CD-ROM drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
