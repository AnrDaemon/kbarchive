TITLE   :INVDOS Crashes AutoCAD Mouse/Tablet Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbInventory smsinv kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

While using Systems Management Server to inventory MS-DOS or Windows (16-bit)
systems that have AutoDesk's AutoCAD versions 10, 11, or 12 installed, INVDOS
will disable the CCMOUSE driver. CCMOUSE is used to emulate a mouse while using
a graphics tablet. The tablet becomes unusable. INVDOS will complete normally
and not report any errors.

CAUSE
=====

When INVDOS is run on systems using CCMOUSE, the mouse detection and
identification tests disable the tablet; the tablet/mouse cursor cannot be used.
The only recovery is to cold boot (power down) the computer and tablet, and use
AutoCAD setup to reconfigure the tablet.

NOTE: When INVDOS completes normally, any SMSSAFE.TMP file is deleted. Since this
file doesn't show that a hardware failure has occurred, the next time INVDOS is
run the same problem will occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create an SMSSAFE.TMP file that contains a "MouseInfo=CRASHED" line. The next
time INVDOS is run, it will find the MouseInfo line, and will not run the mouse
test. It will modify the SMS.INI file, "FailedHardwareCheck" to include the
mouse test. This will prevent INVDOS from attempting to run the mouse test on
that client from then on.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
