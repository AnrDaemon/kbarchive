SUMMARY
=======

When distributing a Systems Management Server shared application package to an
SMS Windows NT distribution server that is also running Services for Macintosh,
a Macintosh volume is created for the new share with the same name as the
Windows NT share. This occurs even though SMS has no attributes for the shared
package designating that the package supports Macintoshes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS can be used to distribute anything to a shared network directory, not just
shared applications for PC platforms. Because Macintoshes are a supported
platform, SMS creates a Macintosh Volume on any SMS Windows NT distribution
server that is also running Services for Macintosh.

This was designed so SMS can be used to distribute applications and data files
for Macintoshes even though SMS itself has no Program Group Control application
for the Macintosh platform. This allows SMS administrators to support multiple
platforms with one distribution point without creating multiple packages and
jobs.
