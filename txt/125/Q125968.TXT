MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the Microsoft Productivity Pack for Windows.

2. Choose the Tutorial button.

3. Choose the Working With Applications button.

4. Choose the Sharing Information Between Documents button.

5. Choose the Go To button and then choose the Next Section button. Note that
   Notepad opens in the background and displays the SPEECH.TXT file.

6. Choose the Go To button and then choose Next Section. Note that Cardfile
   opens in the background and displays the ADDRESS.CRD file, the Cleopatra-like
   image is in the foreground, and that Notepad is minimized to an icon. If you
   click the Notepad icon, you receive a message stating:

   Click the Next button [->] to go on, or click the Go To button to see the
   Go To menu.

When you choose the Next Section button in step 6, you expect Notepad and
Cardfile to be tiled in the background with the Cleopatra-like image in the
foreground. Two buttons, Go To and [->], should be available. When you choose
the [->] button, the tutorial should continue.
