TITLE   :How to Call SetCursorPos() API to Move Mouse Pointer in FoxPro

SUMMARY
=======

You can reposition the mouse pointer (cursor) by using the Windows API function
SetCursorPos(). This function is documented on page 833 of the Windows SDK
Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions manual.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SetCursorPos() function sets the position, in screen coordinates, of the
mouse pointer. Here's the function syntax:

      void SetCursorPos(x,y)

Here x and y are integers; x is the horizontal position and y is the vertical
position. The function is void, so it does not return any value.

Below are code examples for Visual FoxPro using the DECLARE command, and FoxPro
2.x using FOXTOOLS.FLL, that demonstrate how to move the mouse pointer to
position 20,20.

NOTE: For backward compatibility, Visual FoxPro still supports FOXTOOLS.FLL
(included in earlier FoxPro versions), the Visual FoxPro API library that allows
calls to 16-bit .DLL functions. However, in Visual FoxPro, the DECLARE command
is the preferred method for calling .DLL functions.

Visual FoxPro Example Using DECLARE
-----------------------------------

      DECLARE integer SetCursorPos in WIN32API integer, integer
      =SetCursorPos(20,20)
      CLEAR DLLS

FoxPro 2.x Example Using FOXTOOLS.FLL
-------------------------------------

      * Set library to FoxTools.FLL so we can call the Windows
      * API function.
      SET LIBRARY TO SYS(2004)+"foxtools.fll"

      * Register the SetCursorPos with having two integer inputs
      * and void return value.
      setcurpos=REGFN("SetCursorPos","II","")

      * Call the function and move the mouse to position 20,20.
      callsetc=CALLFN(setcurpos,20,20)

      * Release the FoxTools.FLL library.
      SET LIBRARY TO
