MORE INFORMATION

This behavior has been reported with the Diamond Stealth 64 display driver
version 1.06 and Diamond InControl Tools (version 1.21 or 1.30).

In Windows 95, the color depth can be changed by following these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the desktop and select Properties.

2. Click the Settings tab.

3. Select a different Color palette.

4. Click OK and restart Windows when prompted.

At color depths of 256, 64K or 16.7M, the Multimedia applications will run
correctly. Only the Setup program will fail when set to 16.7M colors.
