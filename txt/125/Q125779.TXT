SUMMARY
=======

In Visual C++ version 2.x, the default color for text modified by the
ClassWizard is black print on a white background; in Visual C++ version 4.0, the
default color is dark gray print on a white background. Visual C++ is aware of
the code that the ClassWizard modifies and can highlight these changes for you
using a different color. This makes the new modifications very obvious and easy
to find.

To set a new text color for ClassWizard-modified code using Visual C++ 2.x, do
the following:

 - Choose Options from the Tools menu.

 - Select the Colors Tab in the Options dialog box.

 - Select Wizard-Modified Code in the Set Colors For listbox.

 - Define the colors for text and background.

To set a new text color for ClassWizard-modified code using Visual C++ 4.x and
later versions, do the following:

 - Choose Options... from the Tools menu.

 - Select the Format Tab in the Options dialog box.

 - Select All Windows or Source Windows in the Category listbox.

 - Select Wizard Code in the Colors listbox.

 - Select the desired colors for text and background from the Foreground and
   Background drop-down list boxes, respectively.
