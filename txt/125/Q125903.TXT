-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy a file from a Windows for Workgroups client to an Windows NT file
system (NTFS) volume, and then run DIR to view the file details in a directory
listing, the wrong file size is reported.

This problem occurs when the file you copy is larger than 130,048 bytes (127
KB).

NOTE: The same problem occurs if you view the file in File Manager. The problem
does not occur if you copy the file using File Manager.

CAUSE
=====

NTFS does not update the directory entry until the file handle is closed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, force Windows NT to close the file handle. For
example, copy the file to NULL from the NTFS volume closes the file handle a
command line similar to the following:

   copy <filename>.<ext> NULL

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
