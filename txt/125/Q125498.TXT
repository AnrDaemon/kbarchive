SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS with Microsoft Windows:

 - The Microsoft Windows Print Manager network print queue status line
   displays:

   NETWORK ERROR

 - Print jobs do not appear in the network print queue.

 - Choosing Selected Net Queues from the Print Manager View menu results in the
   following error message:

   A general network error has occurred. Try Again.

   When you select OK, the print job dialog box appears.

CAUSE
=====


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around these problems:

1. Run Print Manager

2. From the Options menu choose Network Settings.

3. Disable Update Network Display.

   The queue status changes to IDLE. An incorrect message appears at the
   top of the screen telling you that the printer is printing regardless of
   the real status of the printer. However, print jobs should now appear in
   the queue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Network Client for
MS-DOS, version 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
