SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Inside Visual C++," second edition.

The following topic is covered:

 - Page 186: Piece of Code Missing

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the error or comment, there are sometimes
additional sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Page 186: Piece of Code Missing
-------------------------------

Line 9 of the code listing on page 186 is missing a member function call.

The existing line is:

      if (m_pDisplayMemDC == NULL) {

Correction:

The correct line should be:

      if (m_pDisplayMemDC->GetSafeHdc() == NULL) {

Comments:

If a program includes the incorrect version of this line of code, you will be
able to compile it, but it will not run correctly.

The source code provided with the CD-ROM in file EX10AVW.CPP contains the correct
code, and this example file can be compiled and executed without any problems.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
