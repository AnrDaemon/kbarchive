own as a local call. To configure MSN to dial an access number with an area code
the same as your own as a long distance call, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the MSN icon, and then click Connection Settings.

2. If you use Windows 98, click the Dial As Long Distance check box to select
   it. If you use Windows 95, click Dialing Properties, and then click the Dial
   As Long Distance Call check box to select it.

3. Click OK until you return to Windows.
