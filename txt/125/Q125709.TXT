TITLE   :/RATIO Switch Not Valid with DRVSPACE /CREATE Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:diskmem win95 kbDiskMemory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the /RATIO switch to set the estimated compression ratio (ECR) when
you are creating a new, empty compressed drive with the DRVSPACE /CREATE
command, the ratio value that you specify is ignored. The ECR for the new
compressed drive defaults to 2.0:1.

CAUSE
=====

The /RATIO switch is not valid when used with the DRVSPACE /CREATE command.


WORKAROUND
==========

Set the ECR for the new compressed drive after the drive has been created. To
set the ECR for the drive, use the DRVSPACE /RATIO command, or run DriveSpace
from inside Windows 95.

The syntax for the DRVSPACE /RATIO command is

   DRVSPACE /RATIO=n.n <drive>

where n.n is the new ratio you want to use and <drive> is the drive letter
of the compressed drive.

To change the ECR from inside Windows 95 DriveSpace, perform the following
steps:

1. Click the compressed drive whose ratio you want to change

2. On the Advanced menu, click Change Ratio

3. Drag the slider to the desired value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create or resize a compressed drive, DriveSpace defaults to a ratio of
2.0:1. The default ECR is always used by DriveSpace when you use the DRVSPACE
/CREATE command.

REFERENCES
==========

For a complete description of the command-line parameters for DriveSpace, see
the Microsoft Windows 95 "Resource Kit," Appendix A, "Command-Line Command
Summary," or run the MS-DOS 6.22 Help by typing

   " help drvspace " (without the quotation marks)

from the DOS directory at an MS-DOS prompt.
