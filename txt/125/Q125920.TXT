-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When importing PROFS gateway templates in to a Mail for PC Networks postoffice,
if you include the T option within the import file (a text file containing user
updates A=Add, M=Modify, D=Delete, or R=Replace), this will create a new
template and remove all old template information.

As a result, the template information for existing users will be lost. If the
intent is to put in new template information for all users, this method is good
to use.

However, if the intent is to add or modify a few individual users, use the A or M
transaction followed by the template data for the user. Do not include the
entire T transaction that indicates creation of a new template.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A T record in the text file means Create the Following Template file when import
is executed. For example:

   T PROFS:VMGate/Node

   Location:~20~20~A~~ Department:~20~20~A~~ System Name:~20~20~A~~

An update import file generally will contain A, M, D, or R types of records for
external postoffices and gateways. A T record is used if a full-refresh (delete
existing information and re-add) is needed to an existing node or when
introducing new nodes.

For PROFS users, user and template information is stored at the Node level. For
each node, information exists in three files:

1. <hexid>.usr (for users)

2. <hexid>.inf (for template information)

3. <hexid>.tpl (for the template)


Additional query words: 3.20 3.20a
