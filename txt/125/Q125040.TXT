-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run Windows for Workgroups Network Setup, you receive the
following error message:

   Setup cannot find or update your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files on drive
   C. If you started your system from a floppy disk, make sure it is not
   write-protected. Insert the disk in drive A and choose the Retry button.

   To place the new version of these files in your Windows directory instead of
   on the floppy disk, choose the Cancel button.

When you choose the Cancel button, you may receive the following error message:

   Windows Setup cannot find or write to the drive where the CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT files are located. CONFIG.SYS will be saved as
   C:\WINDOWS\CONFIG.SYS.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages can occur if you have too many files in the root directory
of your hard disk. The maximum number of files and directories in the root
directory is 512.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this situation, move or delete some of the files in your hard disk's
root directory.
