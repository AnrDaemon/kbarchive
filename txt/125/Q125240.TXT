-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994 edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, 1995 Intro Edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Bookshelf for Windows, 1994 edition and in Bookshelf for Windows, 1995 Intro
Edition, when you attempt to query on the word "near" (without the quotation
marks) while the Find tab is selected, you receive the following error message:

   The search query or a subexpression within parentheses begins or ends with a
   search operator.

In Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 and Bookshelf '96-'97 for Windows, the error
message is:

   A part of the search query contains stop words or begins or ends with a
   search operator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, perform the search after you select the Contents tab or
enclose the word in quotes ("near").

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error is generated because the Find search query uses 'near' as a Boolean
operator in searches. Searching on this word alone is not a valid query.
