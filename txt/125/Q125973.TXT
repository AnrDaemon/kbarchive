KBFile: Updated files for use with Visual C++ 4
-----------------------------------------------

The example programs included with "Animation Techniques in Win32" were developed
for Microsoft Visual C++ versions 1.5 and 2.0. The samples will not compile
properly with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 or later.

Nigel Thompson has developed a set of update makefiles and modifications to allow
the samples to be compiled in Visual C++ 4.1. These files are contained in the
patch file ANIM32_4.EXE.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   ANIM32_4.EXE
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/MSPressPub/Update/2.0/W9XNT4/EN-US/ANIM32_4.EXE)
