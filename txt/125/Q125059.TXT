KEYWORDS:kbtool smsnetmon

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the version of Network Monitor that is shipped with Systems
Management Server version 1.0, the following error message appears:

   The expiration date on this product will be reached within 10 days. If the
   support situation has not been resolved, please contact your support
   representative for more information.

CAUSE
=====

Network Monitor is located in the NMWFW directory on the SMS version 1.0 CD.
Before Network Monitor was shipped with SMS, the program included a built-in
timer that would disable the use of the program after a certain number of days.
The code that displays the expiration message was included with this version of
Network Monitor, but the disabling feature was not.

RESOLUTION
==========

The error message can be ignored. Network Monitor will continue to work
normally.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.
