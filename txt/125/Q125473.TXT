A pass count in a breakpoint allows you to stop on the nth time a
breakpoint condition is met. The integrated debugger in Visual C++ 2.0
includes this feature, but it was not documented or exposed.

To enable this feature, use the /BPPASSC:yes switch on the MSVC command
line. This enables the pass count and exposes a Pass Count control in the
breakpoint dialog.

To set this type of breakpoint, fill in the fields in the breakpoint
dialog as follows:

   Location: .25
   Expression: x==34
   Pass Count: 1022

NOTE: The Pass Count is the number of times to skip, so a count of 1022
will stop execution on the 1023rd time.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10
