TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Tentative Appointments Do Not Show in Planner
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the assistant of a user views the planner of the user, it does not show
tentative appointments the user may have scheduled. However, if the assistant
attempts to book a meeting for the same time as a tentative meeting, the
assistant will receive a warning:

   User already has an appointment booked at this time.
   Do you want to book this overlapping appointment anyway?

This message contradicts the free/busy times in the planner.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Microsoft
Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: schedule plus 1.00
