======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Pressing the ESC key when focus is in a multiline edit control does not cause
the Property Sheet to close (OnCancel) even if it has an IDCANCEL button. This
problem may also exhibit itself when the focus is on other child controls that
return the DLGC_WANTALLKEYS or the DLGC_WANTMESSAGE value in response to a
WM_GETDLGCODE message.

CAUSE
=====

The framework's code for handling the ESC key does not translate the ESC key if
the child window (control) wants to handle it. A multiline edit control, which
requests all messages in response to a WM_GETDLGCODE message, sends a WM_CLOSE
message to its parent window (the CPropertyPage in this case) when the ESC key
is received. However, the WM_CLOSE message is not handled in a CPropertyPage.
Therefore it is ignored and is never received by the CPropertySheet.

RESOLUTION
==========

To take care of this behavior, provide an OnClose() handler for your
CPropertyPage derived class, and post the WM_CLOSE message to the parent window
(the CPropertySheet). Add the WM_CLOSE message handler to your CPropertyPage
derived class using ClassWizard. Then implement it as follows:

   void CMyPropertyPage::OnClose()
       {
       GetParent()->PostMessage(WM_CLOSE);
       CPropertyPage::OnClose();
       }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.10
for Windows NT.
