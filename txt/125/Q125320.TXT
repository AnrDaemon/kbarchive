version 3.5 computers. If you want to view network information of a remote
computer, type the computer name in universal naming conversion (UNC) format
next to Network Info For and press the Tab key.

The information you can view depends on your user permissions on the remote
computer. Guest access allows you to view general network information (such as
the computer name and current user name) and protocols information.
Administrator access allows you to also view network settings and statistics.
