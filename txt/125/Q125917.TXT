TITLE   :PC DirSync: Err Msg: Error 156 Invalid Dirsync Password

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the T2 phase of directory synchronization (Dir-Sync), when SRVMAIN -r
runs, the error

   Error 156 Invalid Dirsync password from PCM:Network/Postoffice

may be displayed even though the password for that postoffice is correct. If you
change the Dir-Sync requester password for this postoffice to NULL using the
ADMIN.EXE program, it does not correct the problem.

In ADMIN.EXE, changing the requester password to NULL through Config, Dir-Sync,
Server, Requester, Modify updates the SRVCONF.GLB on the Dir-Sync server. This
is supposed to bypass the password check.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs because the password received from the requestor is compared
incorrectly against another postoffice (PO) record in SRVCONF.GLB under two
conditions.

1. When the postoffice name in SRVCONF.GLB is similar to or a part of the one
   from the requestor.

2. When the order of registration in the SRVCONF.GLB is such that the record for
   the PO with the shorter name is after the record for the postoffice that is
   sending the T1 message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2a,
included with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in
SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2.12.
