PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a Windows 95 server that is using user-level access
control from a Windows for Workgroups client you receive the following error
message:

   Error 5
   Access Denied

This error message occurs even if you enter a correct domain, user name, and
password when you try to log on.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the following two conditions are met:

 - The Windows 95 server uses user-level access control.

 - The domain (also known as the pass-through domain) the server uses to
   validate clients is different from the client's domain.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:

 - Use share-level access control on the server instead of user-level access
   control.

 - Upgrade the client to a Windows 95 client.

 - Change the client's logon domain to match the server's.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur if you obtain the list of users and groups from a
Novell NetWare server.
