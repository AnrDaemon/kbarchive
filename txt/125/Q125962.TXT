TITLE   :TCP/IP-32 Using DHCP: Can't Override Default Gateway
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::3.11,3.11a,3.11b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, versions 3.11, 3.11a, 3.11b 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If "Enable Automatic DHCP configuration" is selected when configuring a
TCP/IP-32 client, three fields at the bottom of the screen still allow values to
be entered. Any values added to these fields should over-ride the associated
DHCP parameters. However:

 - If the DHCP server provides an "Option 003 Router" address to the client, the
   over-ride doesn't work properly.

 - If the DHCP server does not provide an "Option 003 Router" address to the
   client, and the default gateway field is filled out on the client, there will
   be no default gateway.

CAUSE
=====

TCP/IP-32 is ignoring the DefaultGateway parameter in SYSTEM.INI when DHCP is
enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following route command may be executed on the client:

   route add 0.0.0.0 MASK 0.0.0.0 <router_address>

where <router_address> is the IP address of the default gateway.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP-32, TCP/IP-32a and
TCP/IP-32b. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
