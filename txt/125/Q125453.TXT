SUMMARY
=======

A destination site account is required when you create a Systems Management
Server site address. This article explains what destination site account rights
are required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When one SMS site needs to communicate with another, it does so by writing files
to the destination site's SMS_SITE share DESPOOL.BOX\RECEIVE sub- directory. The
account used to write to this share must have at least CHANGE rights to this
share and directory. For NetWare and other network operating systems (NOSs),
CHANGE rights equates to CREATE/DELETE and READ/WRITE.

Cross site addressing can be setup with connection accounts that do not have
administrator rights on the destination system. This helps eliminate security
concerns when using administrative accounts or configuring trust relationships.

To accomplish this, at each site, create an address that contains the full
domain\username for the account created at the destination site. (This does not
require a trust relationship.) This allows the LAN_SENDER to do the equivalent
of a NET USE \\<server>\SMS_SITE /USER:domain\username command when
connecting to another site.

For example, given the following two sites:

Site:         BPC              VMT
Server:       \\CNSSMS         \\VEMONT
Domain:       PSS-BP           VERMDOMAIN
User account: PSS-BP\SMSSITE   VERMDOMAIN\SMSCONN

At the BPC site, create the address for the VMT site that contains the
VERMDOMAIN\SMSCONN account. At the VMT site, create an address for the BPC site
with the PSS-BP\SMSSITE account.
