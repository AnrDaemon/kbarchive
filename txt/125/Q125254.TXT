The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to Open Other's Appt. Book... in Schedule+ for Windows with the
proper access privileges already set, the user gets the following message:

   The schedule file could not be opened. You may not have the necessary access
   privileges or the file is unavailable.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. From the Options menu, choose Set Access Privileges.

2. From the Set Access Privileges dialog box and in the Users: box, set the
   Default user to None and remove any additional users from the Users list.

3. Click the OK button.

4. From the File menu, choose Exit and Sign Out.

   NOTE: This step is important as it writes the changes to the user's .CAL file.

5. Sign back in to Schedule+ as the same user.

6. Repeat Step 1.

7. From the Users: box, select the Set Access Privileges dialog box and set the
   default or any additional users to the READ privilege or higher. The READ
   privilege is the minimum privilege required when you open another user's
   appointment books.

   NOTE: If any users have the same access privileges as the default user, they
   will not show up in the Users: box.

8. Repeat Steps 3 and 4.

   The user is now ready to Open Other's Appt. Book....

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs when minor corruption affects the user's .CAL file. By
resetting all the access privileges to None and Exiting and Signing Out this
saves the changes to the user's .CAL file.
