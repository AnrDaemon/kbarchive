OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your Creative Writer document contains pictures created with the Rebus tool,
the pictures may not print on an ImageWriter printer. All the text prints,
leaving gaps where the pictures should appear.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are using Macintosh Operating System 7.5, you can install QuickDraw GX,
and the QuickDraw GX ImageWriter driver, which prints the Rebus objects
correctly on the ImageWriter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs if you are using Creative Writer version 1.1 on CD-ROM. This
problem does not occur with Creative Writer 1.0, which is available on disk.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer version 1.1 for
the Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

If you select the Transformer tool, the Rebus tool is the Apple, located between
the Secret Agent and Text Wrap Tools.
