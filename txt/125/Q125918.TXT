OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the T2 phase of directory synchronization (Dir-Sync), when SRVMAIN -r
runs on OS/2 or in the OS/2 subsystem on Microsoft Windows NT, a Trap 000D error
may occur.

CAUSE
=====

SRVMAIN.EXE produces a Trap 000D error when it tries to process a corrupt
attachment sent with the status message from a requestor. The DSSERVER.LOG on
the requestor is the file that gets sent as an attachment to the Dir-Sync
server, and this file contains corruption.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2a of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in SRVMAIN version
3.2.12.
