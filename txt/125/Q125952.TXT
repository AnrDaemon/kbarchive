-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Security menu in File Manager (under Windows or Windows for Workgroups) is
not available after you install the 16-bit Windows NT Server Tools from the
Windows NT Server 3.5 CD. This problem occurs when File Manager cannot find all
of the necessary DLLs to load the Security menu extensions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reenable the Security menu, check the following:

1. During the installation of the Windows NT Server Tools, you can choose
   whether or not to install File Manager extensions. If you did not install
   them, run Windows NT Server Tools Setup again and make sure you specify to
   install File Manager extensions.

2. Make sure the directory where the Windows NT Server Tools are installed
   (SRVTOOLS by default) is in your PATH system environment variable. If not,
   append the name of the correct directory to the PATH statement in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

   NOTE: At the conclusion of Windows NT Server Tools Setup, you are prompted to
   view the NEW-CONF.SYS and NEW-VARS.BAT files and modify your CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Windows NT Server Tools Setup does not modify CONFIG.SYS
   or AUTOEXEC.BAT for you.

3. Make sure the following line is in the [AddOns] section of WINFILE.INI:

   acleditor=<x:\srvtools>\acledt16.dll

   where <x:\srvtools> is the directory in which the Windows NT Server
   Tools were installed.
