PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG# Addon_Bugs: 10577 (2.00.1912)

SYMPTOMS
========

When SQLSetParam is used to insert image/text data where the total size (such
as, the cbcoldef argument for SQLSetParam) is between 64K and 128K, you may
receive the following SQLState 01004 message from the SQL Server driver:

   Data Truncated.

NOTE: This message is received on SQLExecDirect, SQLExecute, or SQLPutData,
depending on whether data-at-execution parameter was used or not.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the ODBC version 2.0 function SQLBindParameter instead of SQLSetParam. This
problem only occurs when SQLSetParam is used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the SQL Server driver version
2.00.1912. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
