TITLE   :PRB: Unable to Open Files That Have Certain Extensions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Files saved with the following extensions cannot be opened as text files in the
Visual Workbench:

   .RES
   .CUR
   .BMP
   .EXE

CAUSE
=====

Visual Workbench is used with other products that reserve these extensions for
specific purposes. It would normally launch tools to handle these files.
However, these tools are not available in the FORTRAN PowerStation product.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the files using a different extension.

STATUS
======

Although this original behavior was by design, it was modified in Microsoft
Fortran PowerStation 32, version 4.0. The 4.0 version of Developer Studio allows
you to open these files and displays their components and component attributes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FORTRAN PowerStation 32 version 1.0 gives the following message when trying to
open these files as a text file:

   The file is a binary file and cannot be read.
