SYMPTOMS
========

When you run RASPHONE.EXE (Remote Access Phone Book) and start the Remote Access
Service in RASADMIN.EXE (Remote Access Administrator's utility), the following
error messages may appear (in the respective versions of Windows NT):

Windows NT version 3.1
----------------------

RASPHONE.EXE:

   The dynamic link library RASAPI32.DLL could not be found in the specified
   path <system and user defined path list>

RASADMIN.EXE:

RASPHONE.EXE:

   An application error log is being generated

RASPHONE.EXE

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x00000000

The error message for RASADMIN.EXE is the same as for Windows NT version 3.1.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if Remote Access Service (RAS) is not installed. When you
install Windows NT, RASPHONE.EXE and RASADMIN.EXE are installed and placed in
the %systemroot%\SYSTEM32 subdirectory. The program items are not present, but
you can run these programs from File Manager.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the Remote Access Service. To install this
service, do the following:

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

2. In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the Add Software button.

3. In the Add Network Software dialog box, select Remote Access Service, and
   then choose the Continue button.

4. Specify the location of the source files.

5. After the Remote Access Service is installed, restart Windows NT.
