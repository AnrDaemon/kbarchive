TITLE   :Voice Pilot Err Msg: "Cannot Access the File at This Time..."
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Windows Products

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to activate a program item in your personal group using a Switch To
macro created with the Voice Pilot feature of the Windows Sound System, the
following error message may be displayed:

   Cannot access the file at this time. Make sure the file is not in use by
   another program, and is a valid program file.

CAUSE
=====

The Command Line field of the program item you are trying to start does not
contain a valid program filename (program files have names with .EXE, .COM,
.BAT, or .PIF extensions).

RESOLUTION
==========

To activate a non-program file (such as a document file) using the Switch To
command, follow these steps:

1. In Program Manager, select the item that you want to activate from your
   personal group.

2. From the File menu, choose Properties.

3. Edit the Command Line field so that the program file associated with the item
   precedes the item's name. For example, to activate the README.TXT file with
   the Notepad program, the Command Line field would read:

      NOTEPAD.EXE README.TXT

MORE INFORMATION
================

You use the Switch To command to start applications or switch to running
applications. When Voice Pilot encounters this command, it loads the program
items that are located in the Program Manager group with the same name as the
current user into the active words list. You can then verbally select the
program item you want to activate or switch to. This program group, known as
your personal group, is created automatically when a new user is created, and it
is maintained in Program Manager.
