KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a DCA IRMA 3 DFT adapter, the following Event Viewer error is
written to the log:

   

   Event ID: 252
   Description:
      Error during initialization, rc = 13

   Explanation:
      An error was returned from a Windows NT function during an attempt
      to initialize the DFT connection.

   Action:
      See your Windows NT documentation for information on return codes.
      Check the return code. Check that the device name of the DFT driver
      specified in the link service dialog matches the name specified in
      the Registry.

Also, starting SNADFTLU.EXE from the <snaroot>\SYSTEM\HWSETUP\DCADFT
directory causes the following error message to appear:

   The procedure entry point sepfpass could not be located in the dynamic
   link library SNATRC.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

There is an old copy of DCADFT.DLL in the SNA\SYSTEM directory, and an old copy
of SNADFTLU.EXE in the SNA\SYSTEM\HWSETUP\DCADFT directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename DCADFT.DLL to DCADFT.OLD. Copy the IBMDFT.DLL file in the SNA\SYSTEM
directory to DCADFT.DLL. Also, copy SNADFTLU.EXE from the
<snaroot>\SYSTEM\HWSETUP\IBMDFT directory to
<snaroot>\SYSTEM\HWSETUP\DCADFT.
