======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The source code for the C/C++ run-time library for Visual C++ version 2.0 is
available to customers for informational and debugging purposes in a
self-extracting file named VC20CTRA.EXE. This release is for the Alpha platform
only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: How to Extract the Source Code from VC20CTRA.EXE
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once you obtain VC20CRTA.EXE, run it using the -D option to extract the source
code and set up the correct directory structure:

   VC20CRTA.EXE -D

You need to use the -D option because VC20CRTA.EXE contains several hundred
files. The -D option sets up the directory structure for the sources. If you do
not use the -D option, you will run into problems attempting to build libraries
from the source.

You need approximately four megabytes of disk space to hold VC20CRTA.EXE and all
the files it contains. You'll need over 20 megabytes of disk space to rebuild
the run-time libraries from the source code. For more details on building the
sources, as well as other notes, please refer to the README.TXT file included
with the release.

How to Obtain VC20CTRA.EXE
