-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may be logged to the DIRSYNC.LOG file. NOTE: This
error is addressed to the Admin account mailbox.

   Warning[154] Non-delivery report
   User mail received addressed to the following unknown
   addresses: NETWORK/POSTOFFICE/admin

CAUSE
=====

This is an informational message. The requestor received a directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) message that is not addressed to it and is not from a
$SYSTEM (Dir-Sync) mailbox. The directory server may receive a Dir- Sync message
that is not addressed to a $SYSTEM mailbox. This message is redirected to the
administrator. The Admin account is used in Dir-Sync by default to receive these
status messages.

In the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE), this option is configured in Config,
Dir-Sync, Server, Options, Administrator. If the default administrator account
(Admin) is deleted, then this option will be blank. Thus, it will cause the
error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run ADMIN.EXE from MS-DOS, go to Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Options,
Administrator and choose a user for the Administrator account.
