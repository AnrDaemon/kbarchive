-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you
receive a message larger than 32K, the following message appears:

   The message is too large to fit into memory
   all at once. Some of it will not be displayed.

When you close the message, you will be prompted to save changes. If you choose
Yes, the message will be truncated. Also, if there are references to attachments
in the message, they may be lost if they fall beyond the 32K boundary.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows Mail client has a maximum display size of 32K. MS-DOS Mail clients
and Mail gateways can send messages that exceed this limit.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent truncation of the message, choose No when prompted to save changes.
To read the entire message, choose Save As from the File menu to save the
message to your hard disk drive. You can then open the saved message in a text
editor and view its entire text.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you make any changes to a message, you are prompted to save your changes when
you close the message:

   Do you want to save changes to <message subject> in '<current
   folder>'?

Choosing Yes will truncate large messages. The next time you open the message,
you won't see the warning message. You will no longer be able to print or save
the entire message.
