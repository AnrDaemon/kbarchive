Windows NT 3.5 provides the ability to reduce the priority of the Print
Spooler so other processes with higher priorities are able to execute
first.

Use the following procedure to change the default priority value of the
Windows NT Print Spooler.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor.

2. Select the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print

3. Select the PriorityClass value.

4. From the Edit menu, choose DWord.

5. Enter a value from 0 to 9.

To set the default priority value, enter 0 (zero). The default priority is
7 on Windows NT Workstation and 9 on Windows NT Server.

A value from 1 to 9 represents the priority of the spooler, with 9 being
the highest priority.
