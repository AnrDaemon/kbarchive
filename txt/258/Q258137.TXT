SYMPTOMS
========

When you use MetaEdit 2.0 to create or modify a binary value, the second
hexadecimal character of the byte overwrites the first hexadecimal character of
the byte.

For example, in the "Edit Metabase Data" dialog box for a binary value, if you
type "1A" (without the quotation marks) in the "Data" text box, and then click
OK, the value of "AA" is actually saved (instead of "1A").

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install MetaEdit 2.1.
