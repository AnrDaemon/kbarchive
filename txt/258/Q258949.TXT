TITLE   :MMS Compass Compatibility with WinSock 2.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Zoomit Compass and Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) Compass are not
compatible with WinSock 2.0 on a Microsoft Windows 95 computer. Compass accepts
the logon credentials and the server selection which makes it appear to function
correctly. However, after an attempt to connect with the server, Compass closes
without warning.

CAUSE
=====

Compass is only compatible with Microsoft Windows 98 or later and Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 or later.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you remove WinSock 2.0 and reinstall WinSock 1.1, Compass functions
correctly.

To Determine If WinSock 2.0 Is Installed
----------------------------------------

For additional information about how to determine if WinSock 2.0 is installed on
your computer, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q177719 How to Identify WinSock 2.0 Run-Time Components for Windows 95

To Reinstall WinSock 1.1
------------------------

When Ws2setup.exe runs the first time, it copies Ws2bakup.bat and the WinSock 1.1
files to %windir%\ws2bakup. So, to return to your original WinSock 1.1
configuration, open and run the Ws2bakup.bat file, which is located in the
following location:

   C:\\WS2BAKUP\ws2bakup.bat

Caution: When you run Ws2bakup.bat on Windows 95, sharing violations can occur
because some system files cannot be restored while a newer version is running.
If sharing violations do occur, you need to run Ws2bakup.bat again, this time in
MS-DOS mode.

To Run Ws2bakup.bat in MS-DOS Mode
----------------------------------

1. Click Start, and then click Shut Down.

2. Click "Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode", and then click OK.

3. After the restart, type "C:\\WS2BAKUP\WS2BAKUP" (without the quotation marks)
   at the command prompt, and then press ENTER.

   Errors messages appear for the programs that cannot run outside of Windows,
   but you should not be concerned because these programs already executed
   properly if you first ran Ws2bakup.bat from inside Windows 95.

4. When this process is finished, restart the computer, and WinSock 1.1 will be
   installed.
