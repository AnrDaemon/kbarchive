-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the troubleshooting shortcuts that are installed by
Allegiance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Allegiance, several troubleshooting shortcuts are installed in
the Allegiance folder. The default location of the Allegiance folder is:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Allegiance

You can use these troubleshooting shortcuts to troubleshoot problems that you may
encounter when you play the game.

Run Allegiance in Safe Mode
---------------------------

Start Allegiance with this shortcut if you are unable to start Allegiance
successfully, or if the program quits unexpectedly during play.

When you play Allegiance in Safe mode, the game movie and sound are turned off,
and the game runs in Software mode, which automatically turns off all high-end
Heads-Up Display (HUD) graphics in the game.

Run Allegiance in Software Mode
-------------------------------

Start Allegiance with this shortcut if any of the following conditions are true:

 - The video adapter installed in your computer does not support 3D
   acceleration.

 - You are experiencing problems with your 3D accelerator.

 - Allegiance has quit unexpectedly, and you are attempting to isolate 3D
   acceleration as the cause.

NOTE: Software mode automatically turns off all high-end HUD graphics in the
game.

Run Allegiance in Window Mode
-----------------------------

Start Allegiance with this shortcut to play Allegiance in a window on the
desktop. In Window mode, you can manage other programs that are open on the
desktop.

NOTE: To use Window mode, the video adapter installed in your computer must
support Window mode. In addition, Window mode usually causes Allegiance to run
slower than in full-screen mode.

Run Allegiance with Checkfiles
------------------------------

Start Allegiance with this shortcut to auto-update Allegiance, a process that
ensures that all of your Allegiance files are up-to-date when you connect to
Zone.com.

Only run Allegiance in this mode if for some reason you think that your game is
not being correctly auto-updated, because Checkfiles mode increases the time it
takes to navigate to the Games List.

Run Allegiance with No Movies
-----------------------------

Start Allegiance with this shortcut to skip the introductory movie. This command
is useful if you experience any problems running the movie.

Run Allegiance with No Sound
----------------------------

Start Allegiance with this shortcut to play Allegiance without any sound. This
command is useful if you experience problems running the game with your sound
card enabled.
