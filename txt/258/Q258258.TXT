TITLE   :XADM: Exchange 5.5 SP3 Mailbox Manager conflicts with Site Serve
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open Mailbox Manager properties and click the Server Selections tab,
the following error message may be displayed:

   LDAP: Protocol error

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Microsoft Site Server is installed on the computer
from the Microsoft Windows NT Option Pack. Site Server installs the Microsoft
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service and causes a conflict with
Mailbox Manager, which uses LDAP to query the directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use the following steps:

1. If you are not using Site Server, either stop and set the LDAP Service to
   manual in Control Panel Services or uninstall Site Server.

2. If you are using the Site Server LDAP service, you need to change the LDAP
   Port number in Exchange Server. To do this, use the following steps:

   a. Start Exchange Server Administrator.

   b. Click Site Container, click Configuration, and then click Protocols.

3. When the LDAP Directory Site Defaults properties page is displayed, change
   the port number to a different number (for example, 390).

   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

4. Click the Authentication tab.

5. Make sure the Windows NT Challenge/Response check box is selected. No other
   options are required to be selected.

6. Stop the Directory service, and then restart the Exchange Server services for
   the new port number to take effect.

7. Ensure Mailbox Manager is working and no error messages are displayed.
