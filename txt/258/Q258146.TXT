The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The OLE Automation for Visual SourceSafe does not expose the pinning
functionality directly. This article provides two functions that you can use to
pin and unpin a file from a Microsoft Visual Basic program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following function pins a file:

   Sub PinFile(objItem As VSSItem, version As Variant)
       Dim objOldItem As VSSItem
       Dim objProject As VSSItem
       
       Set objOldItem = objItem.version(version)
       Set objProject = objItem.Parent
       
       objProject.Share objOldItem, "", 0
           
       Set objOldItem = Nothing
       Set objProject = Nothing
   End Sub

The following function unpins a file:

   Sub UnpinFile(objItem As VSSItem)
       Dim objOldItem As VSSItem
       Dim objProject As VSSItem
       Dim version As Variant
       
       version = 0
       Set objOldItem = objItem.version(version)
       Set objProject = objItem.Parent
       
       objProject.Share objOldItem, "", 0
       
       Set objOldItem = Nothing
       Set objProject = Nothing
       Set version = Nothing
   End Sub
