SYMPTOMS
========

You can open a TN3270 display session that has an associated printer, even
though the associated printer is in use. It is possible to close a TN3270
display session and not close the associated printer session. When this happens,
a user can request and receive a new TN3270 display session that has an
associated printer, even though the associated printer is not available.

TN3270 display session is available before it returns the display LU to the
TN3270 server.
