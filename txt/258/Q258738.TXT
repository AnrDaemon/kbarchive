SUMMARY
=======

You may need to move distribution lists (DLs) from one Recipients container to
another. This article provides the steps that are required to move a
distribution list from one Recipients container to another in the same site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To move a DL to a different container:

1. Click the container that includes the DL that you want to move.

2. On the Tools menu, click Directory Export.

3. Click the file that you want to export the information to.

   NOTE: If no file exists, type a name to create a new file.

4. Make sure that the container that the DL currently resides in is displayed in
   the Container box.

5. Under Export Objects, click only Distribution Lists.

   NOTE: All of the other settings can be left at the default settings.

6. Click Export.

7. When the export is complete, delete the DL from the original Recipients
   container.

   NOTE: If you are moving many DLs and do not want to manually delete them:

   a. Open the .csv file that you created by using Microsoft Excel or a text
      editor such as Notepad.

   b. Add a field called "Mode" in the header of the .csv file, following the
      Obj-Class field.

   c. In each row, type "Delete" (without the quotation marks) in the Mode
      field.

   d. Save the .csv file, and then import it into the Recipients container that
      currently holds the DLs that you want to delete. This deletes all of the
      DLs that are specified in the .csv file.

8. Open the .csv file that you created by using Excel or a text editor such as
   Notepad.

9. Delete any rows other than the first row (which contains column headers) and
   the row that contains the DL that you want to move.

10. Save the .csv file.

11. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the container that you
   want to move the DL to.

12. On the Tools menu, click Directory Import.

13. Make sure that the destination container is displayed in the Container box.

14. Click "Always use selected container".

15. Click Import File, and then click the updated .csv file.

   NOTE: All of the other settings can be left at the default settings.

16. Click Import.

The DL is now displayed in the destination container.
