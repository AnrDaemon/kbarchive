TITLE   :FULL STOP Key on German Keyboard Layout Displays Comma Instead
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the German keyboard layout on a QWERTY keyboard, the FULL
STOP key located in the number pad section of the keyboard should be replaced by
a comma. However, pressing FULL STOP still displays FULL STOP. If you press the
COMMA key on the standard part of the keyboard, a correct comma is displayed.

The U.S. version of Windows 95 with the German keyboard layout exhibits the same
problem.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the keyboard driver used with the German layout. The
virtual key codes differ, but the scan codes do not.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
