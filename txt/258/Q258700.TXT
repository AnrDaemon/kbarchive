SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to use the mount command from a UNIX client to mount a shared
folder, the UNIX client may receive the following error message:

   Permission Denied

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the mount command, it is important to note that it is case
sensitive. If you use the wrong case, Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) version
2.0 returns "NFS3ERR_ACCES" for an invalid mount name request. When the UNIX
client receives this return, it generates the "Permission Denied" error
message.

For example, assume that the computer that is running SFU 2.0 is named SFUSERVER
and has a shared folder named Public. Using the following command does not work
because the folder name is "Public," not "public":

   mount -F nfs SFUSERVER:/public /mnt

The proper command to mount the share is

   mount -F nfs SFUSERVER:/Public /mnt
