PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Packages are created at a primary site and targeted to distribution points,
which include secondary sites of the primary. When packages are created, they
may not arrive and errors are noted in the Distmgr.log file.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you create a package, allow it to be staged on the distribution points
before you update the distribution points with the same package. If you are
currently experiencing this problem, update the distribution points a second
time. This allows the update to proceed normally and the package should arrive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs if the user updates the distribution point immediately
after the package creation.
