This article describes the availability of FAT32 file system support in Windows
95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FAT32 file system support for Windows 95 is available in Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) versions of Windows 95. If you purchased Windows 95 box
product (the full or upgrade version) from a retail store, you have a retail
version of Windows 95. Retail versions of Windows 95 cannot be upgraded to OEM
versions, and there is no separate download to enable FAT32 support in retail
versions of Windows 95. If you have an OEM version of Windows 95 that does not
have FAT32 support, contact your OEM.

To determine the version of Windows 95 you are running:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   System.

2. Click the General tab.

3. Locate the version number under the System heading, and then see the
   following table.

*If you have a version of Windows 95 that does not have FAT32 support, and you
want FAT32, Microsoft recommends that you upgrade to Windows 98 Second Edition.


If you are running an OEM version of Windows 95, the Product ID number under the
Registered To heading typically contains 20 digits. If digits 6, 7, and 8
contain the letters "OEM," your version of Windows 95 is an OEM version. For
example, the following sample Product ID number indicates an OEM installation:

   12345-OEM-6789098-76543

OEM Version Identification
--------------------------

Windows 95 may have been preinstalled on your computer. These installations are
referred to as OEM installations. An OEM Service Release (for example, OSR2) is
an updated version of a product for PC manufacturers (OEMs) to preinstall on new
PCs. This allows OEMs to install an integrated Windows 95 product that contains
the latest available individual updates and supports recent advances in hardware
that require core operating system support.

Additional OEM Information
--------------------------

 - In Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), 2.1 (OSR2.1), and 2.5 (OSR2.5),
   not all files have the version stamp that is listed in the table. In OSR2.1
   and OSR2.5, only files that were updated to provide support for the Win32
   Driver Model (WDM) and Universal Serial Bus (USB) may have this version
   stamp. The other files have the same version stamps as the corresponding OSR2
   files.

   You can view file version information by right-clicking a file in Windows
   Explorer, clicking Properties, and then clicking the Version tab. If there is
   no Version tab, there is no version information available for that file.

 - Updates to Windows 95 OSR2 generally have a version number of 4.00.1112 or
   later.

Additional Information
