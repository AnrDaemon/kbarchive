Disabling the AutoArchive and Personal Folder File Features
-----------------------------------------------------------

To disable the AutoArchive feature in Outlook:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Quit all programs.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   OK.

4. Locate one of the following keys in the registry, as applicable:

    - For Outlook 98:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Outlook\

    - For Outlook 2000:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Outlook\

5. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: DisablePst
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 1

6. Quit Registry Editor.

Outlook Options Impacted
------------------------

 - If you click Tools, click Options, and then click the Other tab, the
   AutoArchive section is hidden. You cannot set AutoArchive options.

 - The AutoArchive tab in each Folder Property dialog box is hidden.

 - All of the AutoArchive settings that were previously set are no longer
   enabled. For example, if you previously configured AutoArchive to move
   messages older than six months from your Sent Items folder to a personal
   folder file, this feature no longer functions.

 - On the File menu, the Archive command is hidden.

 - On the File menu, the "Open Personal Folders File (.pst)" command is hidden.

 - On the File menu, the "Import and Export" command no longer imports or
   exports to a .pst file. If you choose this command, the following message is
   displayed:

   PST (Personal Storage) usage is disabled on this computer.

NOTE: After you add the DisablePst registry key, users can still add the Personal
Folder service to their profiles.
