-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Baseball 2001 version 1.0, quit the program, and then
try to start the program again, you may receive a black screen.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions is true:

 - Your primary video adapter has 2 megabytes (MB) or less of video memory
   installed.

 - Your video driver is outdated.

 - Your video adapter does not support Microsoft DirectDraw.

 - The Hardware Acceleration setting on your computer is not set to Full.

 - An incorrect or duplicate monitor is installed on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Upgrade Your Video Adapter
--------------------------

To run Baseball 2001, your computer must have a video adapter with at least 2 MB
of video memory installed. If your video adapter does not have 2 MB of video
memory, install additional video memory, or upgrade to a video adapter that has
at least 2 MB of video memory.

To estimate the approximate amount of video memory that is installed on your
computer:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks).

3. Click OK.

4. Click the Display tab.

5. Under Device, verify the amount of memory that is listed next to "Approx.
   Total Memory".

   NOTE: If a video accelerator card is installed on your computer, a Display 1
   and a Display 2 tab are available. Click either tab to verify the approximate
   total memory.

6. Click Exit.

If the approximate total memory is more than 2 MB, and the behavior continues to
occur, contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to determine how to
resolve this issue.
