TITLE   :"Object Not Found" Error Message Accessing "The Known Universe"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
 - Zoomit VIA, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to the Compass client and try to access The Known Universe, you
may receive the following error message:

   Object Not Found

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed if the Known Universe or DSA object is missing
from the directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Known Universe and DSA objects are created by default upon initialization of
the directory. These objects are necessary for the metadirectory server to run.
The directory tree may not be accessible without these objects; a root base must
be specified when you starting Compass to browse the directory tree.

To Recover Mandatory Objects
----------------------------

1. Run the following command to log on and browse. This may allow you to browse
   and discover the missing object:

   compass2 -r "o=<orgname>,c=<country>"

2. At a command prompt, run the following commands:

   zoomserv\bin\init\oid\updoid.bat (refreshes the schema)

   zoomserv\bin\init\importt -updatedib -updateallattributes (rebuilds the naming
   structure)

   zoomserv\bin\init\methods\loadmeth.bat (restores the directory methods)

3. Run ViaCompact.

This should create a refreshed state for default objects in the directory.
