SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply formatting to a portion of a list item, Word may not apply
identical formatting to the second and consecutive items in the list.

For example, in the following list, the first sentence of the first list item is
bold, and the second sentence is italicized. When you press ENTER and type the
next list item, the first sentence of the list item is bold, but the second
sentence is not italicized:

1. This is bold. This is italic.

2. This is bold. This is italic.

NOTE: This problem occurs for either numbered or bulleted lists.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, after you type the second list item (where the
formatting does not appear correctly), move the insertion point back to the end
of the first list item, and then press ENTER. The correct formatting is then
applied to the new second list item and successive list items when you press
ENTER. After the list is complete, manually apply the correct formatting to the
second sentence of the last list item.

NOTE: For automatic lists and formatting to occur in a bulleted or numbered list,
be sure the automatic list and "Format beginning of list item like the one
before it" options are selected on the AutoFormat As You Type tab. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect.

2. On the "AutoFormat As You Type" tab, make sure the automatic list options are
   selected. For example, click to select Automatic numbered lists or Automatic
   bulleted lists or both.

3. Also on the "AutoFormat As You Type" tab, make sure the "Format beginning of
   list item like the one before it" check box is selected.

4. Click OK.
