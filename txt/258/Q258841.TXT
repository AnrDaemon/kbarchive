Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized

CAUTION: You must have multi-language support enabled to run this sample form
effectively. For more information on enabling multi-language support, please see
the "References" section.

After downloading and unzipping KybdStck.exe to a temporary directory, run the
form KybdStck. The list box is populated with any loaded Keyboard Layouts.
Clicking on a language sets the keyboard layout to that language. Clicking on
the button at the bottom of the form displays the currently selected layout.

This form demonstrates the following points:

 - The Init event of the list box uses the GetKeyboardLayoutList function to get
   the number of Keyboard Layouts loaded. It also uses the GetKeyboardLayoutName
   and ActivateKeyboardLayout functions to generate a list of the loaded
   layouts.

 - The click event of the command button uses the GetKeyboardLayoutName function
   to get the name of the currently loaded layout.

 - The click event of the list box uses the ActivateKeyboardLayout function to
   set the layout to the selected language.
