TITLE   :Cannot Retrieve Default Web Site from External Network
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Proxy Server on a Web server, the Default Web Site
cannot be retrieved by default from the external network even though the All
Unassigned option is selected in the properties for the Default Web Site.

The following error messages may occur:

   10053 Software caused connection to abort

   Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site http://<name>/.
   The server returned an invalid or unrecognized response

Any other Web site that uses the All Unassigned option or specifies an IP address
can be viewed on the outside network.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the W3proxy.dll file is running as an ISAPI
extension in the Default Web Site. The W3proxy.dll file filters out the
requests, and rejects all incoming connections. It only accepts the incoming
connections after the Enable Web Publishing setting is selected.

Any other Web site that does not contain the W3proxy.dll file as an ISAPI
extension is not bound by the Enable Web Publishing setting of Web Proxy.

Web Proxy only runs on the Default Web Site. This behavior is by design for Proxy
Server 2.0. Also, the Default Web Site should not be changed. In other words, do
not change the IP addressing, Default Web Site name, or the local path. General
practice is not to change it at all; however, you can add virtual directories to
the Default Web Site.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select the Enable Web Publishing setting in Web Proxy and send all requests to
the local server.
