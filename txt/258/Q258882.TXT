TITLE   :Management Agent Can Be Damaged by Low-Disk-Space Condition
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Management Agent (MA) icon may not be visible in the Compass client, or if
the MA icon is visible, commands may be missing from the Actions menu.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you run the MA with insufficient disk space. Operating
the MA with insufficient disk space can cause unpredictable behavior, including
corruption of the MA.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, increase the available disk space. Monitor the disk space
on a regular basis to prevent this issue from occurring. You can also run
Viacompact to resolve this issue, but in most cases you must delete and
re-create the MA. The database may also be damaged; and you may need to
reinstall Microsoft Metadirectory Services.
