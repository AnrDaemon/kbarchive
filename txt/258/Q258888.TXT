TITLE   :PRB: Error When Query Builder Runs Parameterized Queries

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Query Builder in the Data Environment of Visual Basic to run
parameterized queries, you may receive the following error message:

   Provider cannot derive parameter and SetParameterInfo has not been called.

This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Oracle OLE DB Provider.

CAUSE
=====

Query Builder does not process the parameter information from the Command
object's property page. To obtain the parameter information, Query Builder calls
the DescribeParameters function of OLE DB Provider. This error is thrown because
OLE DB Provider does not support this functionality. Query Builder does not run
parameterized queries if the provider does not support DescribeParameters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use Query Builder to create parameterized queries,
and set the parameter information on the Command object's property page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. From the Project menu, click Add Data Environment.

3. Right-click the Connection1 object, and then click Properties.

4. Double-click Microsoft OLEDB Provider for Oracle.

5. Type the necessary information to connect to an Oracle server. Make sure that
   you click Test Connection to verify the information, and then click OK.

6. Right-click the Connection1 object, and then click Add Command.

7. Right-click Command1, and then click Properties.

8. On the General tab of the property page, click SQL Statement, and then click
   Query Builder.

9. Create a query with a parameter in the WHERE clause. To do this, type a
   question mark (?) in the Criteria column, or add the query in the SQL code
   window. For example:

   SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Name = ?

10. From the Query menu, click Run. You receive the above-mentioned error
   message.
