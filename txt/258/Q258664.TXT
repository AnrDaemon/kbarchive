Change the Microsoft Windows Display Settings

On some computers, you can improve the frame rate in Baseball 2001 by changing

   computer.

   If no such tab is present, click the Settings tab.

4. Click Advanced.

6. Turn off the synchronize vertical refresh feature (sometimes called "Vsync in
   flip").

   If you do not see the synchronize vertical refresh feature, proceed to the

   If the issue continues to occur after you adjust the settings described in

   until you experience an improved frame rate in the game.

   NOTE: If you do not see an Adapter tab, you cannot change the refresh rate for
   your video adapter.

   NOTE: If you do not see an option for turning off anti-aliasing, you cannot
