TITLE   :Cluster Spooler Reports Node Name Instead of Virtual Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0; winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition with Microsoft Cluster Server
(MSCS) and you receive a print spooler notification, the notification reports
the node name of the print server instead of the virtual name.

CAUSE
=====

MSCS registers clustered printers with the local Spooler service. Because
notification is the responsibility of the Spooler service, this behavior occurs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server
Enterprise Edition version 4.0.
