SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) 2.1, you can use a Together
Administration Management Agent (TAMA) to add resources to directory objects
with dynamic rather than static processes.

In a static configuration, when the TAMA resource is attached to a particular
object in the metaverse, it applies to all subordinate objects.

As an alternative, the dynamic configuration does not attach the resource to any
point in the tree. Instead, you configure the rules on the Rules form. To use
this form, click "Operate the Together Administration MA", click Configuration
Settings, and then click the Rules form. These rules allow multiple conditions
to be evaluated against each metaverse entry, resulting in the possibility of
coincident multiple resource assignments. This is the add or hire scenario. The
opposite is the remove or fire scenario.

You cannot implement the remove or fire scenario with these resource assignments
by using the -= scripting language operator in the Rules template.

The target attribute, zcTaAccountResourceDNs, is multi-valued, therefore the -=
operator is normally required. However, if the operator is used, the user
typically receives the following results:

 - An error (14014) if the zcTaAccountResourceDNs attribute contains no values.

 - The object is not deleted in the connected directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MMS version 2.1 does not support fire abilities in the hire-fire scenario.
