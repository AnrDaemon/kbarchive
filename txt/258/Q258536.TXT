Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run Visual FoxPro 6.0 under Hebrew-Enabled Windows 98.

2. In Visual FoxPro, create a program (.prg).

3. Before typing anything in the .prg, follow these steps in the code editor:

   a. Press the TAB key and then type "This is a Test" (without the quotation
      marks).

   b. Press the ENTER key to move the cursor to the second line.

   c. On the second line, press the BACKSPACE key to move the cursor to the
      beginning, and then type "This is a second line" (without the quotation
      marks).

   d. Then, press the HOME key to move the cursor back to the beginning of the
      second line.

   e. Press the UP ARROW key.

NOTE: At this point, when the UP ARROW key is pressed, the cursor stays in the
same location and does not move up to the line above it.
