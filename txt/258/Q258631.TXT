The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA print service does not search for Printer Definition Table (PDT) files
before it starts the SNA print sessions. The PDT files are located and loaded
when each print job is started. If the PDT is corrupt or cannot be found, the
print job completes successfully without any error messages; however, the PDT
file is not used to format the job or send commands to the printers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, click the following article number to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft SNA Server, versions
3.0 (all service packs), 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2. This problem was first corrected
in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With SNA Server 4.0 SP3 installed, the SNA print service validates PDT files
before it starts the print session. SNA print sessions that use PDT files do not
start if the PDT file is corrupt or cannot be found. The status of these
sessions remains inactive. The SNA Virtual Print Driver logs the following error
message in event ID 24 in the Application event log:

   The SNA Virtual Print Driver cannot load the specified PDT file.
   Please check that the file has been configured correctly.

   PDT file name: C:\SNA\SYSTEM\HPLJ2.PDT
   Driver: WINSPOOL
   Printer: \\SNASERVER\PrintSession1
