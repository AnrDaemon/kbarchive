Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From Visual FoxPro, create a program containing the following code:

   *Start of Code
   Child1 = CREATEOBJECT("SessionChild1")
   ? Child1.DATASESSION

   Child2 = CREATEOBJECT("SessionChild2")
   ? Child2.DATASESSION

   DEFINE CLASS SessionChild1 AS SESSION
   	DATASESSION = 1
   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS SessionChild2 AS SESSION
   	DATASESSION = 2
   ENDDEFINE
   *End of Code

2. Run the program created in step 1 above. The value for the DATASESSION
   property is 2 for both classes. It should display 1 for Child1 and 2 for
   Child2.
