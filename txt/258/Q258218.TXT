   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

During the Interix installation process, you may receive the following error
message:

   Pathname not normalized

You may also receive error messages when you try to run the Interix command-line
utilities.

CAUSE
=====

Interix is case sensitive. The Interix installer checks the case (either
uppercase or lowercase) of the installation folder (if it exists) and sets the
registry values to those you provide at the time of installation. If you use the
wrong case when you provide the folder location during Setup, Interix is
installed correctly but the following registry values may be incorrect:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Softway Systems\Interix\InstallRoot

   HEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\softway systems\Interix\_CS_PATH

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Microsoft recommends that you accept the default values when you are installing
Interix. If you cannot use the default values, change the registry values listed
earlier in this article to reflect the correct case.
