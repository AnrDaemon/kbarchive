TITLE   :XCLN: Unable to Import .pst File into Outlook Profile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to import a .pst file from a CD-ROM to your Outlook folders by using
the Outlook Import and Export Wizard, in the Import dialog box, after you browse
to the .pst file, you may receive the following error message:

   Personal Folders:
   Properties for this information service must be defined prior to use.

If you click OK, you may receive the following error message:

   Microsoft Outlook:
   File access is denied. You do not have permission required to acces the file
   c:\<path_name>.


If you click OK again, the Import dialog box is displayed, so that you can browse
to the .pst file again.

This behavior also occurs if you attempt to open a .pst file from a CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because when you burn a file to a CD-ROM, the file is
created with a read-only file attribute. There is no way to change this on a
CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, copy the .pst file from the CD-ROM and save it to a
hard disk or to another type of media in which you can change the file
properties. Cancel the selection of the read-only attribute on the .pst file and
save the changes. The Import process should now finish successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A .pst file is not specific to a version of Exchange Server or to the operating
system, so if you use a .pst file that is from a different version, it does not
affect the Import process. A .pst file is not owner specific either, although
password-protected .pst files require you to provide the password to finish the
Import process.
