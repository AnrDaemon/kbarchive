SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the ImgEdit.ocx control in a MFC application running on Windows NT
4.0, you may get a debug assertion in the RtlHeapFree function when you exit a
debug build of the application. However, when you employ the same control in
Visual Basic, you do not encounter the debug assertion in RtlHeapFree upon
exiting. In addition, when you use the ImgEdit.ocx control in a release build of
a MFC application on Windows NT 4.0, the control does not reveal this assertion.
And the assertion does not appear when you you run the application on Windows
95, Windows 98 or Windows 2000, but appears does appear on Windows NT 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

This is a bug in the ImgEdit.ocx control. The assertion can be safely ignored
because it is only given one time and that is when the application is shutting
down. This assertion does not cause any problems when you are running in release
builds.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ignore the assertion as it is harmless in this case.


STATUS
======

This behavior is a bug in the ImgEdit.ocx control.
