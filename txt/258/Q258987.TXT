======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to remotely control a client from the Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 Administrator console, you may receive the following error message in
the Smsprov.log file.

   [18D][Fri 03/17/2000 16:08:23]:
   *
   *
   E:\OPALSP1\sdk_provider\nt\smsprov\SspUtility.cpp(1467) : Error Extracting
   property:TopLevelSiteCode
   *
   *

Note that there are no corresponding error messages on the Administrator console
screen, and no status messages are generated.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is the normal result of using remote control or any other utility
that calls the internal RaiseRawStatusMsg method without setting the optional
TopLevelSiteCode parameter. When any of the optional parameters for the
SMS_StatusMessage methods (such as RaiseRawStatusMsg, RaiseErrorStatusMsg,
RaiseWarningStatusMsg, or RaiseInformationalStatusMsg) are not included, an
error message is generated in the Smsprov.log file warning of the missing
parameter.

NOTE: No error message is returned by the provider and the methods function
normally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is not due to a problem in the execution of the remote control
code, and can be safely ignored.
