OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 1 site
server to Service Pack 2, the upgrade process may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when a site system running as a Software Metering server
cannot be stopped remotely.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, stop the SMS_License_Server service on site
systems that are acting as Software Metering servers, or remove the Software
Metering role from site systems before you run the Service Pack 2 upgrade.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
