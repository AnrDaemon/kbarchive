   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server supports the use of a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
extension called ETRN for dial-up connections that use Remote Access Service
(RAS). After the client host submits the ETRN command to the server host, a new
connection is established from the server host to the client host, and mail to
the client host domain is retried immediately.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can disable ETRN by modifying the registry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Using RegEdit
-------------

1. Start Regedit.exe.

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

3. Click Edit, and then click New DWORD Value.

4. Type "DisableETRN" (without the quotation marks). Under "Value data", type
   "1" (without the quotation marks).

Using RegEdt32
--------------

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: DisableETRN
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 1

4. Quit Registry Editor.
