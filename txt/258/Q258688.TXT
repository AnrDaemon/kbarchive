SUMMARY
=======

When you use WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) with Microsoft
Site Server Personalization and Membership (P&M), and your Web site requires
Membership Authentication, neither the Forms Authentication method nor the
Cookie Authentication method can be used. WebDAV does not support these
authentication methods.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following Membership Authentication types are used with both the Forms
Authentication and Cookie Authentication methods:

 - Anonymous

 - Basic

 - Distributed Password Authentication (DPA)

Workaround:

If you use WebDAV for the entire Web site, and either the Forms Authentication
method or the Cookie Authentication method is used, create a second Web site
that is configured to use the same content directories, but with a valid and
supported authentication method.

NOTE: The second site is accessible by the Web developers and other
administrators only.
