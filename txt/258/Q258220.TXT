TITLE   :XFOR: Migration Wizard Does Not Support cc:Mail Database 7
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Exchange Server Migration Wizard does not support Lotus cc:Mail DB7
postoffices. Lotus cc:Mail Mobile (cc:Mobile) versions 2.x and 6.x both use this
database format. As a result, the Migration Wizard cannot import this data into
the Exchange Server computer or a .pst file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - The DB6 postoffice is used by earlier cc:Mail clients and postoffices.

 - The DB7 postoffice is used exclusively for cc:Mobile postoffices (local
   copies of a user's mailbox on another postoffice).

 - The DB8 postoffice is the current standard postoffice for cc:Mail version 6
   and later.

You can copy data from DB7 postoffices back to an existing DB8 postoffice, and
then migrate from there.
