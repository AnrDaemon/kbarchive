TITLE   :XADM: Space Not Gained After Changing Deleted Items Retention
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you reduce the number of days for the Deleted Items Retention setting in the
Exchange Server Administrator program and then run an offline defragmentation,
the space that should be reclaimed from the removal of deleted items that exceed
the new Deleted Items Retention setting is not freed from the Priv.edb database.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the removal of these deleted items is not completed
until an online defragmentation (information store maintenance) has been run on
the Priv.edb database. After an online defragmentation of the Priv.edb database
is allowed to finish, an offline defragmentation reclaims free space from the
database.

WORKAROUND
==========

To free up space in the Priv.edb database as quickly as possible after you
reduce the days in Deleted Items Retention, open the properties of the Server
object, click the IS Maintenance tab, and then click Always to run an online
defragmentation.

The online defragmentation may take up to 30 minutes to begin. The beginning of
the defragmentation is logged with the following event in the application event
log:

   Event ID: 179
   Source: Ese97
   Type: Information
   Category: Online Defragmentation
   Description: MSExchangeIS (170) Online Defragmentation is beginning a full
   pass on database 'C:\exchsrvr\mdbdata\priv.edb'.

   The defrag may take several hours to complete and upon complete will log the
   following in the application log:

   Event ID: 180
   Source: Ese97
   Type: Information
   Category: Online Defragmentation
   Description: MSExchangeIS (170) Online Defragmentation has completed a full
   pass on database 'C:\exchsrvr\mdbdata\priv.edb'.

After the online defragmentation is complete, you must stop the information store
to run the offline defragmentation (the eseutil /d /ispriv command) and reclaim
the free space.
