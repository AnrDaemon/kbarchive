TITLE   :IIS Log Contains Wrong Data When ISAPI Uses Default File Size
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an ISAPI application uses the HSE_TF_INFO data structure to issue a
ServerSupportFunction(HSE_REQ_TRANSMIT_FILE), it is allowed to specify 0 as the
value of the HSE_TF_INFO::BytesToWrite meaning, "send all file." If zero is
specified, then the sc-bytes value in the Internet Information Services (IIS)
log file is invalid, because it reflects only the headers and not the entire
transfer size.

CAUSE
=====

IIS does not log the total size of the file that is actually transferred, but
uses the size argument transmitted to the TransmitFile API.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
