KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you move mailboxes with the Move Mailbox command in the Exchange
Administrator program, incoming messages may bounce back to the sender during
the move process.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, supply an alternate recipient for the mailbox
during the move process. After you move the mailbox, you can forwarded the mail
from the alternate recipient's mailbox to the destination mailbox.

To specify an alternate recipient, open the mailbox properties page, click Modify
on the Delivery Options tab in the Alternate Recipients section, and then choose
the mailbox to which you want the mail to be redirected. After the alternate
recipient is no longer necessary, you can remove the alternate recipient on the
Delivery Options tab if you change the alternate recipient to None.
