modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restrict the available Internet Protocol (IP) ports that are available
for remote procedure call (RPC) dynamic port allocation by adding the DCOM
Internet key in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\RPC registry key, the
Cluster service may not start or you may not be able to remotely connect to the
Cluster service by using Cluster Administrator. This problem typically occurs if
the Cluster nodes are seperated by a firewall. When the Cluster service on a
node starts, it first tries to contact one of the other nodes in the Cluster
through RPC.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the range of available IP ports that the Cluster
service uses to initiate communication through RPCs is too small. The Cluster
service relies heavily on RPC to function properly. If there are not enough
ports available, the Cluster service cannot communicate.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, make a minimum of 20 ports available in the defined
range of available ports. For example, the following registry entry has 20 ports
available in the defined port range:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\RPC

   Ports: REG_MULTI_SZ: 8011-8031
   PortsInternetAvailable: REG_SZ: Y
   UseInternetPorts: REG_SZ: Y

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is best to have 50-100 ports available, because many other services use DCOM
ports in the dynamic range (1025-65000, everything below 1025 is a pre-defined
port). Examples of other services that use dynamic ports include Domain Name
System (DNS), Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS), and Microsoft SQL Server.
