This article shows how to read a REG_SZ value from the registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

This information about the registry editor in this article is for Microsoft
Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 2000. If you are running Windows 9X, you have
to use Regedit.exe instead of Regedt32.exe.

NOTE: This article uses a registry key that is created just for testing and
should be deleted when you are finished.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Key, and then add the following registry Key:

   Key Name:   VfpRegTest

4. Click on the Key added in step 3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then
   add the following value:

   Value Name: TestREG_SZ
   Data Type:  REG_SZ
   Value:      This is a Test. 

5. Quit Registry Editor.

6. From Visual FoxPro, create a program and enter the following code:

   *Start of Code
   #DEFINE HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE          -2147483646

   LOCAL nKey, cSubKey, cValue,  cValueRead
   nKey = HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   cSubKey = "Software\VfpRegTest"
   cValue = "TestREG_SZ"

   cValueRead = ReadREG_SZ(nKey, cSubKey, cValue)
   IF (EMPTY(cValueRead)) THEN
      =MESSAGEBOX("Function Not Successful.")
   ELSE
      ? cValueRead
      =MESSAGEBOX("Function Successful.")
   ENDIF

   FUNCTION ReadREG_SZ
   * This function reads a REG_SZ value from the registry. If successful,
   * it will return the value read. If not successful, it will return an empty string.
      PARAMETERS  nKey, cSubKey, cValue
      * nKey The root key to open. It can be any of the constants defined below.
      *  #DEFINE HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT           -2147483648
      *  #DEFINE HKEY_CURRENT_USER           -2147483647
      *  #DEFINE HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE          -2147483646
      *  #DEFINE HKEY_USERS                  -2147483645
      * cSubKey The SubKey to open.
      * cValue The value that is going to be read.

      * Constants that are needed for Registry functions
      #DEFINE REG_SZ   1

      * WIN 32 API functions that are used
      DECLARE Integer RegOpenKey IN Win32API ;
         Integer nHKey, String @cSubKey, Integer @nResult
      DECLARE Integer RegQueryValueEx IN Win32API ;
         Integer nHKey, String lpszValueName, Integer dwReserved,;
         Integer @lpdwType, String @lpbData, Integer @lpcbData
      DECLARE Integer RegCloseKey IN Win32API Integer nHKey

      * Local variables used
      LOCAL nErrCode      && Error Code returned from Registry functions
      LOCAL nKeyHandle    && Handle to Key that is opened in the Registry
      LOCAL lpdwValueType && Type of Value that we are looking for
      LOCAL lpbValue      && The data stored in the value
      LOCAL lpcbValueSize && Size of the variable
      LOCAL lpdwReserved  && Reserved Must be 0
       
      * Initialize the variables
      nKeyHandle = 0
      lpdwReserved = 0           
      lpdwValueType = REG_SZ
      lpbValue = ""
      
      nErrCode = RegOpenKey(nKey, cSubKey, @nKeyHandle)
      * If the error code isn't 0, then the key doesn't exist or can't be opened.
      IF (nErrCode # 0) THEN
         RETURN ""
      ENDIF

      lpcbValueSize = 1 
      * Get the size of the data in the value
      nErrCode=RegQueryValueEx(nKeyHandle, cValue, lpdwReserved, @lpdwValueType, @lpbValue, @lpcbValueSize)

      * Make the buffer big enough
      lpbValue = SPACE(lpcbValueSize)   
      nErrCode=RegQueryValueEx(nKeyHandle, cValue, lpdwReserved, @lpdwValueType, @lpbValue, @lpcbValueSize)
      
      =RegCloseKey(nKeyHandle)
      IF (nErrCode # 0) THEN
         RETURN ""
      ENDIF

      lpbValue = LEFT(lpbValue, lpcbValueSize - 1)
   RETURN lpbValue
   * End of Code

7. Run the program created in step 6. A message box appears reading "Function
   Successful" and the value appears on the screen.

8. You can replace nKey, cSubKey, and cValue with your information to be read
   from the registry.
