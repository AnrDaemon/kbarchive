======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Baseball 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start a game in Microsoft Baseball 2001, the screen may turn
black except for the "Today's Match-Up" text, and the game may stop responding
(hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a Permedia 3 Create video adapter is installed in the
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, configure Baseball 2001 to run in Software mode:

1. Start Baseball 2001.

2. On the Home Plate screen, click Options.

3. Click the Graphics tab.

4. Under Mode, click Software, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the Permedia 3 Create video adapter is detected as a 3-D video adapter
by Microsoft Baseball 2001, this video adapter does not provide sufficient
hardware acceleration support to run the game in 3D Hardware mode.
