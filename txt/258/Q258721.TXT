TITLE   :HTTP Compression Will Not Work with URLs that Include a "/"
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Neither static nor dynamic compression works if the URL contains a slash as part
of the parameters passed to the executing DLL file. You can confirm that the
file is not being compressed because it is not in the Internet Information
Services (IIS) compressed folder. By default, the compressed folder is located
at:

   %WINNT%\IIS Temporary Compressed Files

   http://server/isapi.dll/Dir?Param=Value
