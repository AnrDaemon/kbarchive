PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) Migration Extractor
utility, that is included with Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 on a Banyan
server, the following error message may be logged in the Windows NT Event Viewer
application event log:

   Event ID: 14002
   Event Source: MSExchangeMig
   IMAP server returned an error response while migrating mailbox
   'usuario1%ncc%migracion': "0004 BAD UID Request "0004 UID FETCH 5
   (RFC822.PEEK)" at column 25".

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Banyan server does not accept the command UID FETCH
5 (RFC822.PEEK) that is sent by the IMAP extractor.

According to the Request for Comments (RFC) 2060, this command is now obsolete
and should be replaced by the command UID FETCH 5 (RFC822).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
