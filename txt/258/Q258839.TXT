TITLE   :Space at End of Batch File Name Causes Server to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Cmd.exe from other programs or batch files with another batch
file as a parameter, the script does not run but appears to be busy if the file
name is padded with space character.

When you check in Task Manager, you find a large number of instances of Cmd.exe.
Eventually, you receive error messages caused by insufficient memory, C run-time
error messages, or DLL initialization error messages.

A sample command line is:

   cmd /c "test.bat "

Note the extra space character before the second quotation mark. The contents of
Test.bat do not matter.

CAUSE
=====

Cmd.exe contains a parsing error that results in the behavior described in the
"Symptoms" section.
