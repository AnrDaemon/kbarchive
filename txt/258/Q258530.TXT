KEYWORDS:kbProjManager kbvfp600 kbvfp600bug kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbVS600sp4fix kb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When obtaining multiple references to an object in the Project.Files collection,
you may receive the error message:

   OLE Exception error: Exception code c0000005. OLE object may be corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

A workaround in builds of Visual FoxPro 6.0 prior to Visual Studio Service Pack
4 is to refer to the objects in the Files collection by number instead of name.
The following code does not produce the exception error in Visual Studio Service
Pack 3 and earlier:

   *Start of Code
   MODIFY PROJECT proj1 NOWAIT NOSHOW
   loFile = Application.ActiveProject.Files(1)
   ? VARTYPE(loFile)            && Should be "O" for object
   RELEASE loFile
   loFile = Application.ActiveProject.Files(1)
   *End of Code

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.
