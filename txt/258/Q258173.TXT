MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project with a default form. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the Project menu, click to select Components, choose Microsoft Chart
   Control in the Components dialog box, and click OK.

3. Add an instance of the Chart Control to Form1. Enlarge the Chart Control so
   that its contents are easily visible, and then resize the form as needed.

4. Add the following code to the Code window of Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
        MSChart1.RowCount = 5
        MSChart1.ColumnCount = 1

        With MSChart1.Plot.Axis(VtChAxisIdX).Labels(1)
            .Auto = False
            .TextLayout.Orientation = VtOrientationHorizontal
            .TextLayout.HorzAlignment = VtHorizontalAlignmentFill
            .TextLayout.WordWrap = True
        End With
        
        Dim i As Long
        For i = 1 To MSChart1.RowCount
           MSChart1.Row = i
           MSChart1.RowLabel = "This is column number " & i
        Next
   End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the application and note that the labels are not
   wrapped. Instead, they are overlapped.
