Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form in Form Designer.

2. Add a table with about 5000 records to the data environment of the form.

3. Drag the table from the data environment and drop it onto the form to create
   a grid.

4. Run the form.

On a slow computer, the form shows up and pauses for a second, then the grid
shows up. Now, try to use the DOWN ARROW key to move to the records that are not
currently in the grid's viewable area, and note that the new records refresh
very slowly.
