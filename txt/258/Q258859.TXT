-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Installing Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) version 2.0 creates a special user
account named SFUUSER. The SFU Cron and Remote Shell service programs use the
default SFUUSER context to run programs when all other forms of user
authentication do not succeed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Services that use this special user context first attempt to run programs under
the context of the user who invoked the command. Only when all authentication
mechanisms do not succeed do they default to using the SFUUSER context, which
has limited privileges.

The SFUUSER account belongs to the USERS group, and does not have Change Password
privileges. Administrators should not attempt to delete this user or reset the
password. Changes or removal could cause the Cron or Remote Shell service
programs not to work.
