SYMPTOMS

Arabic-enabled Windows 9x or Windows NT. When previewing, printing to a print
device, or directing output to the screen, the report does not print all
characters. The characters are omitted at random; therefore, different
characters may appear or disappear each time the report runs.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run Visual FoxPro 6.0 on Hebrew or Arabic Windows 98.

2. Create a Quick Report based on the Customer sample table.

3. Add some fields to the Detail Band of the report.

4. Print or preview the report.

NOTE: In the output of the report, you should see that some random characters are
missing from the report. If you do not see this behavior the very first time,
repeat step 4 several times.
