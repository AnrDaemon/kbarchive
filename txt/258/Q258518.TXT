TITLE   :RPC Unavailable Error Appears When You Try to Access a Cluster S
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access the Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) through the cluster
administrator, the following error message may appear:

   An Error occurred trying to open the cluster at 'cluster_name'
   The RPC Server is unavailable
   Error ID: 1722 (000006ba)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for many reasons. The following is a list of some of the
possible causes:

 - Computer specified is not a cluster server.

 - Network connection is down.

 - Cluster nodes are reporting errors

 - Cluster group is off-line.

 - Cluster service on the target system stopped.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, check to make sure the computer you are connecting to
is actually a cluster server. If the cluster group has been taken off-line or
paused for a soft rollover, connecting to the node name allows you to bring the
resource group back online. If all other attempts to open the cluster
administrator fail, specify a "." character from one of the cluster nodes when
asked which cluster to administer. By specifying the "." character, the node
that you are logged on to will search itself for the cluster service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSCS uses remote procedure calls (RPC) and requires that the RPC service be
running on both systems. Check to make sure that the RPC service is running on
both systems and that the system event logs on each server do not have any
RPC-related errors.

Ensure that the server is operational and that both the Cluster Service and the
RPC services are running. Also, check the name resolution of the cluster; it is
possible that you are using the wrong name or that the name is not being
properly resolved by WINS or DNS.
