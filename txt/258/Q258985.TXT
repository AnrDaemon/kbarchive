SUMMARY
=======

This article explains why MSN 5.x cannot be uninstalled, and how it can be
turned off.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSN 5.x is built on the same codebase as Windows 98 SE and ME releases, and was
not designed to be uninstalled like other software applications.

However, when you turn MSN off, the software removes everything but the desktop
icon and the setup and installation files. Because of this, if you want to use
MSN again, all you need to do is double-click the desktop icon. The setup screen
will display and you will not need the CD to reinstall.

MSN 5.x is intentionally easy to disable and enable. If a you have a problem with
a corrupted file, turning off and then reinstalling the software may fix the
problem.

To turn MSN off, use the following step:

1. Click the MSN Quick View icon in the Task Tray.

2. Select MSN Options.

3. Then click Turn MSN Off.

To reinstall or turn on MSN double-click the MSN icon on the desktop and follow
the instructions.

Note: Turning off MSN on your computer does not cancel your MSN account. To
cancel your account go to http://memberservices.msn.com/us/uscancel.htm
