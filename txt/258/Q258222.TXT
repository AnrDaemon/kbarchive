SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how Mailbox Manager uses the System Cleanup folder, and
the way that deleted item retention interacts with the System Cleanup folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you set the deletion mode to "Move to System Cleanup Folders", a replica of
the existing mailbox folder hierarchy is created in a top-level folder called
the System Cleanup folder. Targeted messages are moved to the corresponding
folder in the System Cleanup folder, which retains the folder location of a
given message.

If a user deletes a message from the System Cleanup folder, it is moved to the
Deleted Items folder. If a message is deleted from the Deleted Items folder, you
may be able to recover the message, depending on the deleted item retention
time.

If items are deleted from the System Cleanup folder based on the policies for
folder age limits on System Cleanup folders, these items are deleted permanently
from the user's mailbox and cannot be recovered.

Additional query words: item recovery
