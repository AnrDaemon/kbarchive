-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse to your WebClass application (Internet Information Server
application), you receive the following error message in your browser:

   Server object error 'ASP 0177 : 800401f3'
   Server.CreateObject failed
   YourWebClass.asp, line 8
   Invalid class string

where line 8 contains the following code:

   Set Application("~WC~WebClassManager") = Server.CreateObject("WebClassRuntime.WebClassManager")

CAUSE
=====

The WebClass Runtime file (Mswcrun.dll) does not exist on your Web server, or
WebClass Runtime is not registered. WebClass Runtime is one of the system files
required for your WebClass applications to function properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that WebClass Runtime exists on your Web server. If it does not exist,
use the Package and Deployment Wizard to create a standard setup package. Run
the setup package on your Web server to install and register the necessary
system files, which includes WebClass Runtime.

If WebClass Runtime does exist on your Web server, you must register it. To do
so, type the following at a command prompt:

   

   regsvr32 "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Designer\mswcrun.dll"

NOTE: The authenticating user (IUSR_machinename if using anonymous access) needs
to have Read and Execute NTFS permissions on Mswcrun.dll.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
