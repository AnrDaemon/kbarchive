SYMPTOMS
========

When you create queues on a cluster in Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ),

2. Remove MSMQ from node 1.

3. Restore the backup of the MSMQ shared directory.

4. Remove MSMQ from node 2.

5. Remove virtual server from Message Queue Information Store (MQIS) through the
   Primary Enterprise Controller's (PEC) MSMQ Explorer.

6. Verify that MSMQ is completely removed from both nodes.

7. Install MSMQ on node 1 from Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP), but do not
   restart.

8. Stop both MSMQ and Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC)
   resources.

9. Move all resources to node 2 to ensure that MSMQ and DTC resources are
   offline.
