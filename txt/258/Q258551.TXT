TITLE   :BUG: Incorrect Error Message When You Install VSS 5.0 Y2K
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbSSafe500bug kbDSupport kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade Visual SourceSafe 5.0 to apply the year 2000 (Y2K) update, the
following error message can occur:

   This update can only be applied to Visual SourceSafe 5.0 Service Pack 3
   installations. Please update your Visual SourceSafe 5.0 installation with
   Service Pack 3 and run this update again. Exiting setup.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because of one of the following reasons:

 - You attempt to run the Vssy2k.exe file with an Visual SourceSafe 5.0
   directory that has the year 2000 (Y2K) update already installed.

   -or-

 - You attempt to run the Vssy2k.exe file with a network client that was
   installed from a Visual SourceSafe server that has the year 2000 (Y2K) update
   already installed.

This behavior is by design.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you install Visual SourceSafe 5.0 Service Pack 3 first, and then apply the
hotfix, the error message displays incorrectly because you already have the
version that the Vssy2k.exe file is trying to install, and it does not need to
update the files.
