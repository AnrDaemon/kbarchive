TITLE   :XADM: Site Addressing Generates Wrong SMTP Addr. for "%g.%s.%m"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server 5.5 site addressing may generate incorrect Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP) addresses for "%g.%s.%m". If there are no given name (first
name) and surname (last name) values entered, the SMTP address that results is
"<alias>.<alias>", instead of "<alias>".


CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because when a user has no last name, the alias is copied
to the last name field in the recipient information structure before the
recipient information is passed to the proxy generator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
