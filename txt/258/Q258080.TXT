DOCUMENT:Q258080  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :Digital Drives and Drive Letters Disappear with Clustered Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart your server, some Digital Array controllers may randomly lose
the shared drive in a cluster.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the /pcilock switch is enabled on one computer but
not on the other.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, enable the /pcilock switch in the Boot.ini file. Then,
shut down and then restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The /pcilock switch prevents the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) from moving
anything on the PCI bus. The I/O and memory resources are left exactly as they
were set by the BIOS.
