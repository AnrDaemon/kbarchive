SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates how to use the Microsoft Visual Basic Package and
Deployment Wizard to successfully deploy a Visual Basic application that
references the SQL-DMO library.

The following definition for SQL-DMO is found in Microsoft SQL Server Books
Online:

   SQL Distributed Management Objects (SQL-DMO) is a collection of objects
   encapsulating Microsoft(r) SQL Server(tm) database and replication
   management.

In Microsoft Visual Basic, if you set a reference to the SQL-DMO library, you can
then use Visual Basic to view and modify database schemas and perform common
database management tasks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SQL-DMO library consists of eight redistributable files. These files, with
their default installation folders, are:

+---------------------------------------------+
| File Name    | Path                         | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| Sqldmo.dll   | \Mssql7\Binn\                | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| Sqldmo.rll   | \Mssql7\Binn\Resources\1033\ | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| Sqlresld.dll | \Mssql7\Binn\                | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| Sqlsvc.dll   | \Mssql7\Binn\                | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| Sqlsvc.rll   | \Mssql7\Binn\Resources\1033\ | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| Sqlwoa.dll   | \Windows\System32\           | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| Sqlwid.dll   | \Windows\System32\           | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| W95scm.dll   | \Mssql7\Binn\                | 
+---------------------------------------------+

These files must be deployed as part of any application that references the
SQL-DMO objects. The Microsoft Visual Basic Package and Deployment Wizard does
not recognize all the dependencies of the Sqldmo.dll file and therefore, does
not automatically include all the necessary files.

For additional information about dependency (.dep) files, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q228940 INF: VB .DEP Files not Available for SQL 7.0 Redistributable
   Components

In order to properly deploy the SQL-DMO library, you must add all the preceding
files to the list of the Included Files dialog box of the Package and Deployment
Wizard during the packaging phase. When you are prompted with the File Open
dialog box, you will find these files in the folders listed in the preceding
table.

In the Install Locations dialog box, set the Install Location of the Sqlwoa.dll
file to $(WinSysPath). The other files will default to $(AppPath) and can be
left unchanged.

NOTE: If you are installing the SQL-DMO Objects as shared, you may want to
relocate the other components to a common location such as the Windows System
Path as well.

Finally, the setup application must be instructed to register the Sqldmo.dll
file. The Package and Deployment Wizard will not automatically register the
file. To instruct the setup application to register this component, open the
Setup.lst file that was generated with the package, and then edit the following
line:

   File7=@sqldmo.dll,$(AppPath),,,2/8/00 3:42:08 AM,2625536,2000.2.8.0

Add "$(DLLSelfRegister)", the instruction to register the dll, after the install
location constant, as follows:

   File7=@sqldmo.dll,$(AppPath),$(DLLSelfRegister),,2/8/00 3:42:08 AM,2625536,2000.2.8.0

NOTE: The file number, date, time and version number of your files may be
different than the ones shown in the code sample.

Save the Setup.lst file. This completes the steps required to deploy the SQL-DMO
Objects support files with your Visual Basic application.
