TITLE   :XADM: ILS Servername and ILS Username Attributes in Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Exchange Server Administrator program to open the properties of
an Exchange Server mailbox, the ILS server name and ILS user name attributes are
displayed on Advanced tab of the individual mailboxes. These additional
properties are similar to the City or Phone attributes that are displayed on the
General tab of the mailbox. The ILS server name and ILS user name attributes are
only informational; you cannot use them to log on to an Internet List Service
(ILS) directory, such as those in Microsoft Site Server or Microsoft NetMeeting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To query these additional attributes, either use Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) calls in code or use a utility such as Ldp.exe, which is
included on the Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit CD-ROM.

ILS directories, such as those in NetMeeting, cannot be dynamically populated by
specifying these additional fields.

Additional query words: User
