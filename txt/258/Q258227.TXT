(') and is running as a low rights user, the secure enumeration of objects does
not work because the instance limiting process includes the user and group names
in the query and uses apostrophes (single quotes) as a delimiter. The following
error message is logged in the Smsprov.log:

   E:\OPALSP1\sdk_provider\nt\smsprov\SspCollection.cpp(362) : Error retrieving
   object CollectionID= SQL Error: Unclosed quotation mark before the character
   string ')
