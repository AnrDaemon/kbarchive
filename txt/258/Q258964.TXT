The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Select a Flight feature to start a new flight in Microsoft
Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition and then change your aircraft to the
Mooney Bravo or Mooney Bravo IFR, you may experience the following symptoms:

 - If you change your aircraft to the Mooney Bravo before you take off, the
   aircraft may not move, even when you increase the throttle to full power.

 - If you change your aircraft to the Mooney Bravo while you are in flight, you
   may experience either of the following symptoms:

    - The aircraft starts performing uncontrollable aerobatic maneuvers.

    - The instrument panel indicates low manifold pressure, but maximum RPM. In
      addition, the aircraft does not maintain altitude, and it eventually
      stalls and crashes.

These symptoms continue to occur when you reset the flight or use the Select a
Flight feature to start another flight, even if you do not change your
aircraft.

This behavior continues to occur until you quit and restart Flight Simulator 2000
Professional.
