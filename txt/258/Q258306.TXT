TITLE   :Microsoft INTERIX Installation Program Stops Responding

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Interix versions 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.4.03, 2.2.4.08, 2.2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

INTERIX, Microsoft's Unix environment on Windows NT, may stop responding as it
installs. Looking at the hard drive will not show any directory creation, no
files will have been copied, but a look under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Softway Systems will have been created. The
installation simply begins clocking.

CAUSE
=====

The installation routine is looking for an active POSIX subsystem. This would be
one of three files located in Winnt\System32, Psxrun.exe, Posix.exe, and
Psxdll.dll. These files are shipped with Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft
Windows 2000, and comprise the POSIX subsystem. They are frequently "adjusted"
by different POSIX-dependent applications, such as the Windows NT 4.0 FTP
server, and various POSIX-compliant applications from third parties.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you can use an environment variable from the command
prompt.

From an MS-DOS prompt (assuming the CD-ROM drive is drive D): C:\> set
CHECKSS=NO C:\> d: D:\> D:\> cd X86 D:\X86> setup.exe

This should allow the installation routine to progress normally. You may see a
"path name not normalized" message; if you have taken all INTERIX defaults, this
should not be an issue. If it is, see "Path Name Not Normalized" in the
Knowledge Base.
