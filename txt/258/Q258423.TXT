SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Starburst sender with Systems Management Server (SMS),
the optional "Preferred Sender" package property does not function properly.
Typically, this package property causes SMS to favor the selected sender over
higher-priority senders that may be available for the destination address. When
the Starburst sender is selected as the preferred sender for a given package,
SMS does not override any higher-priority addresses in favor of the Starburst
sender.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
