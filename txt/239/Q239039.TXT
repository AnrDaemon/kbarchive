TITLE   :CPU Usage Is Set to an Incorrect Value Using HTMLA
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the HTML Web Administration forms that ship with Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0, you can set an incorrect value for CPU throttling. This
should not cause problems; however, you should be sure the values are correct
when you use this method. For example, if you set the value for "Percent CPU
Usage" to 800 percent, the value is accepted and written to the IIS metabase.
Note that this value leaves the site unrestricted (by default).

CAUSE
=====

The HTML Web Administration forms do not properly check the values entered in
the form.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure the values are correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services version 5.0.
