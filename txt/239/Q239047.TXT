SYMPTOMS
========

In the Internet Services Manager (ISM), when you access the properties of a site
and click the Help button, the following error message may occur:

   A Help file was not specified. (138)

Note: This does not apply to the HTML Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0
documentation. This only occurs when you access the properties of a site and
click the Help button.

CAUSE

Users must be members of at least the Power Users group in order to view the
Help file for Internet Information Services 5.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

If site operators (and other appropriate users) need access to these Help files,
add them to the Power Users group. Be aware that this action gives users more
access to the server and may be considered a potential security risk.

5.0.
