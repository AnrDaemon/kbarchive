PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server 2.0 SP1 32-bit Installer version 2.0.91 does not
remove duplicate registry keys when you perform an uninstallation. This behavior
occurs only when the package is compiled in 32-bit mode.

For example, if you create a script that adds the following keys, the second key
is not removed during uninstallation:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SOFTAPPx\

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\SOFTAPPx\

When the same script is compiled in 16/32-bit mode, the uninstallation process
removes both entries.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Compile the script in 16/32-bit mode.

 - Use a version of SMS Installer earlier than version 2.0.91.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 2.0.91.
