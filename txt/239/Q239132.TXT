SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange and Outlook Clients appear to stop responding (hang)
periodically during normal operation when used in conjunction with an Exchange
Server computer that has clients that connect over slower connections.

CAUSE
=====

The remote procedure call (RPC) Receive Any Thread in use by the Microsoft
Exchange Information Store Service is waiting to receive additional information
from a client.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Clients that are connecting to the Exchange Server computer over slower
connections have a higher latency in the sending and receiving of data grams.
The RPC Receive Any Thread is waiting on additional data grams before processing
the clients request. This causes other clients that are attempting to
communicate on the Receive Any thread to the Exchange Information Store to
appear to hang while waiting for a response from the Exchange Server computer.
