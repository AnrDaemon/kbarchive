TITLE   :XADM: MTA Queue Message Time Ahead One Hour Following DST Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP2,5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2 exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

With Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 (SP2), post-SP2 fixes, and Service Pack
3, the message transfer agent (MTA) queues may show the message submit time as
one hour ahead of the actual submit time after the local Daylight Saving time
(DST) changeover occurs.

This is only visible when you are monitoring MTA queues with the Exchange Server
Administrator program. It does not affect message delivery nor client message
information.

WORKAROUND
==========

Cycling (stopping and restarting) the MTA following DST changeover causes the
Administrator program to display the correct submit time for messages in MTA
queues.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

Additional query words: daylight DST time timestamp
