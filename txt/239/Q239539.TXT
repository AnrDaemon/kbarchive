SUMMARY
=======

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Microsoft Certificate Server 1.0

By default, certificates issued by Microsoft Certificate Server 1.0 are valid for
one year. You can modify the registry values under the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\CertSvc\Configuration\<YourCAName>

Default values:

1. ValidityPeriod REG_SZ "Years" (Must be plural!)
2. ValidityPeriodUnits REG_DWORD 0x1
3. Set ValidityPeriodUnits to an integer value, from 1-5. Stop, and then
   restart, the Certificate Server service.
4. The validity period of a root Microsoft Certificate Server CA certificate is
   five years for Certificate Server 1.0.
5. The validity period of a non-root Microsoft Certificate Server CA certificate
   is controlled by the issuing Certificate Authority.
6. Certificates issued by your Certificate Server will expire no later than the
   same time when your CA Certificate expires.

   For example, if there are only two years left on your CA Certificate, issued
   certificates will be valid for no more than two years, even if you set the
   registry to issue five year certificates.
