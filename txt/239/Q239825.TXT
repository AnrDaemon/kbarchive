The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

Some common actions for Windows CE developers are:

 - Transferring or copying files between the desktop and the emulator object
   store.

 - Deleting a file from the emulator.

 - Checking to see if a file exists in the object store.

 - Synchronizing a tree with the object store.

 - Running a file or application from the object store with parameters.

A command-line utility is provided by Microsoft to enable these actions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To perform these transferring, deleting, synchronizing, and executing
activities, use the command-line utility Empfile.exe, which is found in the
Emulation\Windows folder for the target emulator. For example, if you are
targeting for the Windows CE version 2.0 Emulation for Handheld PCs then on your
desktop at the command prompt you would change the directory to:

   <path>\WCE200\MS HPC\Emulation\Windows

The following is a list of command line options.

Usage:

  EMPFILE [options]...

Options:

 -c SOURCE DEST  'put' or 'get' a file from the object store
 -d FILE         delete a file on the object store
 -e FILE         check to see if a file exists on the object store
 -s              synchronize the object store with Wce\Emul\Platform\ tree
 -r MYAPP ARGS   run Myapp.exe in the object store with arguments ARGS

Examples:

   EMPFILE -s
           synchronize Wce\Emul\PLATFORM\ tree with the object store

   EMPFILE -c c:\test.exe wce:windows\test.exe
           copy C:\Test.exe to the object store's Windows\ directory

   EMPFILE -c wce:test.exe c:\test.exe
           copy Test.exe from the object store to c:\ 

   EMPFILE -e windows\text.exe
           verify that Test.exe exists in the object store's Windows\ directory

   EMPFILE -d test.txt
           delete Test.txt from the object store root directory

   EMPFILE -r test.exe -10
           run test.exe from the object store with parameter "-10"

NOTES:

 - "PLATFORM" is the platform selected in the Emulation Settings dialog box.

 - Wildcards (such as in "*.exe") are not supported.

 - Specify the fully qualified path name for the copy command.

 - The -s option is available only for Emulation for Palm-Size PC Version 2.01
   and Emulation for Handheld PC Version 2.0
