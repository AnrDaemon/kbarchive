SYMPTOMS
========

When a user browses files and directories on an Internet Information Services
5.0 FTP Server using CuteFTP, an error message similar to the following may
occur:

   550 Directory: Access Denied
   Failed to Change Dir

The error usually occurs when the user is attempting to download a "queued" file.

CAUSE
=====

This error is most often caused by an attempt to connect to the FTP site when
the user does not have list permissions on the directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, assign list and read permissions on the directories
that the user (or the user's group) needs permissions to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about setting directory and file permissions on FTP
content, see the Windows 2000 Resource Kit and the Internet Information Services
