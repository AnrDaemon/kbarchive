======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the MEM command in an MS-DOS session within Windows, the value
displayed for Extended (XMS) memory may be under 64 megabytes (MB), even though
the computer may have more than 64 MB of physical memory installed. Also, the
values for Extended memory and Total memory may be displayed as question marks
(?).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because programs running in an MS-DOS session in Windows
can gain access to a maximum of 64 MB of extended memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

The actual amount of physical memory detected by Windows is displayed in the
System tool in Control Panel. The amount of free memory available is displayed
in the System Monitor tool.

availability, please click the article number below to view the article in the

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
