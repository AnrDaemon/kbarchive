PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Exchange Server 5.5 Chat services on a computer running
Windows 2000 Server, you may receive the following error message when you try to
administer the Chat service:

   Internet Services Manager
   The service configuration dynamic link library 'chatcfg.dll' failed to load
   correctly. The specified module could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

In Exchange Server versions earlier than Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1,
Chat runs as an Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI)
extension, and is dependant upon Internet Services Manager for configuration and
administration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

STATUS
======

This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you apply the latest Exchange Server 5.5 service pack, you update the Chat
service to run as its own service; it is no longer dependent upon the Internet
Service Manager and you can administer and configure it by using its own
Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
