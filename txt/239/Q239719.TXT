-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5, versions Build 2.573.2927, Build 2.573.3513, Build 2.573.3711, Build 2.573.4202 
 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Oracle, versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle (MSORCL32.DLL) version 2.573.4202 (and
earlier versions) and the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Oracle (MSDAORA.DLL)
version 2.10.4202 (and earlier versions)have not been tested with Oracle 8i. So
connectivity to Oracle 8i is not supported with this version or earlier versions
of the Microsoft Driver/Provider.

They have been successfully tested to run with the Oracle 8.x (excluding Oracle
8i) client software going against an Oracle 8.x server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle version 2.573.4202 and the Microsoft OLE DB
Provider for Oracle version 2.10.4202 do not support any Oracle 8.x specific
(including Oracle 8i) features. Oracle 8.x specific datatypes are one such
example of an unsupported feature. Datatypes such as CLOB, BLOB, BFILE, NCHAR,
NCLOB, NVARCHAR2, which were introduced with Oracle 8.x, are not supported using
this version or earlier versions of the Microsoft Driver/Provider.

The MDAC 2.5 versions of the provider (2.50.4403) and driver (2.573.4403) were
tested against Oracle 8i servers and support connectivity. If Oracle 8i
connectivity is required please upgrade to at least the MDAC 2.5 version of the
provider and driver.

Driver/OLEDB Provider can be obtained from the MSOracle32Readme.txt file for the
