PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After fully removing and reinstalling Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)
2.0 on a server that is running Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 2000
with a new site code that is alphanumerically greater than a previously
installed site, SMS Administrator consoles cannot connect to the new site
server.

Whether the SMS Administrator Console is excuted locally or remotely, the SMS
Administrator Console is unable to connect to the SMS Site Database. The SMS
Administrator Console displays the following message:

   Connection Failed

Also, SMSprov.log contains the following error message:

   11A][Mon 10/02/2000 19:50:57]:CSspClassManager::Initialize, Reading SQL db
   info from registry for sitecode WWW... [11A][Mon 10/02/2000 19:50:57]:NOTE:If
   the site has just been installed, the registry may not yet be set up and the
   follwing may be normal: [11A][Mon 10/02/2000 19:50:57]:
   *
   E:\OPALSP2\sdk_provider\nt\smsprov\SspClassManager.cpp(437) : Failed to find
   specific provider config, failing INIT this time around, will try again.

SMSProv.log is located on the server where the SMS Provider is installed. During
SMS primary site installation, the SMS administrator can choose the location of
the SMS Provider. It can be installed on the SMS site server, or a remote SQL
server. After it is installed, it cannot be relocated unless SMS is reinstalled.

CAUSE
=====

When you remove a site server, its namespace is not removed from the Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) repository (previously known as WBEM) for the
server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, on the site server provider perform the following
steps:

1. Run the C:\Winnt\System32\Wbem\Wbemtest.exe utility locally.

2. Click Connect.

3. In the Server/Namespace box, type "root\sms" (without the quotation marks),
   and then click Login.

4. After you are connected, click Enum Classes.

5. Click Recursive, and then click OK.

6. Scroll down and double-click SMS_ProviderLocation().

7. Click Instances.

8. You should see two "SMS__ProviderLocation.SiteCode='<XXX>'" entries.
   Select the old site's site code, and then click Delete.

9. Double-click the __Namespace object.

10. Click Instances.

11. You should see two "__Namespace.name='site_XXX'" entries. Select the old
   site's site code, and then click Delete.

12. Close Wbemtest.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
