TITLE   :IIS: "Unable to Enumerate Files and Directories"
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbIIS kbiis500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Internet Services Manager you may receive the following error
message:

   "Unable to enumerate files and directories because the following error
   occurred: The system cannot find the path specified"

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the directory specified for the home directory of a
site (for example, the default Web site) is inaccessible because it has been
deleted, moved, or SYSTEM does not have access to the resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this error, perform the following steps:

1. Check the "Home Directory" for the site (under the home directory tab in the
   sites properties) to make sure that it is pointing to a valid location.

2. Check to ensure that the directory still exists and has not been moved.

3. Check to ensure that the SYSTEM has permissions on the directory specified in
   the home directory box. Often, moving the content to another drive will cause
   this problem. SYSTEM is not automatically added to partitions other than the
   system drive.

STATUS
======

This is a known issue when using Internet Information Services 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on setting directory permissions, see the Windows 2000
Resource Kit as well as the Internet Information Services documentation.
