SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Manager performs the cleanup, you may see

   NT User ExchService logged on to ExUser1 mailbox, and is not the Primary
   Windows NT Account on this mailbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. An event with the ID 1016 is logged when you attempt to
access another user's mailbox or schedule. Mailbox Manager does not disable this
security logging.
