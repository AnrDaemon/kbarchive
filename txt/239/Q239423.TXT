SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Word Count feature (on the Tools menu, click Word Count) to
count the number of pages, words, characters, paragraphs, or lines in a
selection of text in a Word document, the "Include footnotes and endnotes" check
box is not available, and Word cannot include the text of your footnotes and
endnotes in the count.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has available a Selection Word Count macro that counts the words in
the selected text. The macro also counts the words in footnotes and endnotes for
the selected text that contains footnote or endnote references. For additional
information about the Word Count macro, click the article number below to view

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Selection Word Count macro may be of particular interest when you create
legal documents. Many courts require a word count of a document that excludes
the table of contents. You can use this macro to obtain this type of word count.
