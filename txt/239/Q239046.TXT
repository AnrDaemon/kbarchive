SYMPTOMS
========

When you administer an Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 Web server using
the IIS snap-in (through the Internet Services Manager or other method), the
following error message may occur:

   Error Connecting to server, unexpected error 0x80074002 occurred
   Do you wish to continue to attempt to connect in the future?

Where server is the name of the local computer.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur when the metabase has become corrupted. The metabase stores
settings used in Internet Information Services.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, you should attempt to restore the metabase from a
backup. If this does not correct the problem, however, you may need to restore
the metabase from a system backup.

The metabase, Metabase.bin, is located in the (default) C:\WINNT\System32\inetsrv
(%WinDir%\System32\inetsrv) directory.
