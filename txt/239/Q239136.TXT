 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

If you do not select the "Use administrator settings" option in the Remote
Control tool in Control Panel and you repair Remote Control Agent using the
Systems Management tool, the Permitted Viewers list is reconfigured to use the
Systems Management Server defaults. Any custom changes you made in the site
properties are lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Stop the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE services.

2. Copy the updated Compver.ini file to the
   <SMS_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl directory.

3. Copy the hotfixed .exe file(s) (not the DLL) to the
   <SMS_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl\<Platform> directory.

4. Start the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE services.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the hotfixed
files to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process, you can stop
and restart the SMS Client Service on each client. You can also create a
software distribution for one of the Resource Kit tools Setevnt.exe or
Cliutils.exe along with the appropriate parameter(s) to start a CCIM work cycle.
For information on the proper syntax to use with these tools, see the Resource
Kit documentation.
