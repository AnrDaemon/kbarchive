PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200fix kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SMS_SITE_SYSTEM_STATUS_SUMMARIZER may generate an "Access violation" error
message and cause the SMS_EXECUTIVE service to shut down. When this occurs, a
Crash.log file is created that reports the failure.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) component in
Systems Management Server (SMS) contains an error code that is not properly
handled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Bundle



To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the SMS site server:

1. Stop the SMS services.

2. Copy the updated Mslmsvrn.dll file to the SMS\Bin\<Platform> folder.

3. Restart the SMS services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMS_EXECUTIVE service stops a short time after starting, and Site Component
Manager restarts it on its next cycle. You can end up with multiple Crash.log
files.

The last entry recorded in the Sitestat.log file (with no NAL Logging) when the
problem occurs is:

---->: The distribution point ["Display=\\SMSSVR\"]MSWNET:["SMS_SITE=XXX"]\\SMSSVR\ is a server. 
Enumerating drives.  $$<SMS_SITE_SYSTEM_STATUS_SUMMARIZER>

The last entry recorded in the Sitestat.log file (with NAL logging level = 0x7)
when the problem occurs is:

NAL[4] - Attempting to get level 2 information for share C$ on server SMSSVR.  $$<SMS_SITE_SYSTEM_STATUS_SUMMARIZER>
NAL[1] - ERROR: NetShareGetInfo failed.  The operation completed successfully.~~
$$<SMS_SITE_SYSTEM_STATUS_SUMMARIZER>
