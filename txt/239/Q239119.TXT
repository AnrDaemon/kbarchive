TITLE   :BUG: FDISK Reports Incorrect Disk Capacity for PCMCIA ATA Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:kbOSWin95bug kbOSWin98bug kbDSupport kbGrpDSWin9xDDK

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

FDISK, when run from an MS-DOS box after Windows has been started, reports the
wrong disk size for PCCARD-based ATA drives that contain a storage capacity
greater than 1023 cylinders. This issue generally applies to disk drives that do
not appear in real mode prior to protected-mode Windows (this problem occurs,
for example, with drives where the controller has no BIOS extension, so MS-DOS
has no way of knowing that they exist).

CAUSE
=====

A bug in the IDE device driver, Esdi_506.pdr, results in FDISK using INT 13
function 8 to obtain disk geometry information. This function truncates the
cylinder count to a 10-bit value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
