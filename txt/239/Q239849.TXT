TITLE   :Type Mismatch Error Occurs When UDT Is a COMTI Return Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp2

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Visual Basic client invokes a method of a COM Transaction Integrator for CICS
and IMS (COMTI) component library, which declares a user-defined type (UDT) as a
return value for the method. Visual Basic responds with a "type mismatch" error
and the code does not compile. This only happens when the COMTI component is
early bound. The UDT is defined in the Visual Basic code by referencing its
declaration in the component library. Under the same circumstances, if late
binding is used, the code compiles and executes correctly. In this case, the
compiler has no knowledge of the component and a type mismatch can not occur.

CAUSE
=====

The COMTI Component Builder (CB) declares the return value as a UDT pointer. The
Visual Basic statement that invokes the COMTI method specifies the return value
as a UDT, which is why there is a type mismatch.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, make the UDT an [output] parameter instead of a
return value, or use late binding.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0, SP2.
