   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view a Web site, after you install the Dial-Up Networking 1.3, or
Winsock 2 update to Windows 95, Internet Explorer may intermittently return the
following error message:

   Internet Explorer cannot open the internet site URL:<web address> the
   connection to the server was reset.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Dial-Up Networking and Winsock 2 include RFC 1323
implementations of Time Stamp and Window sizing information in the TCP/IP
header. If the Web Server that you are connecting to or a router that your
requests pass though do not recognize RFC 1323 options, it may reset the
connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, add an MSTCP registry key to the following registry key
(if the MSTCP key does not already exist):

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

Then, add a DWORD value named TCP1323Opts with a data value of 0 (zero) to the
following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSTCP

MORE INFORMATION
================

This option is disabled by default in Windows 98.
