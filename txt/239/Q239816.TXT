OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 exc55sp1 exc55sp2 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a message is sent to a domain whose mail servers are currently unavailable
and the message has a subject that includes the substring "%s", the Internet
Mail Service may stop responding (crashes) if the SMTP protocol logging is set
to Maximum.

CAUSE
=====

The crash occurs when the "499 No routing hosts are reachable" error is written
into the SMTP log file. The original string to be written is:

   "7/5/99 9:31:55 PM : 499 No routing hosts are reachable for test.com. Message
   subject: ""RE:33%s5%s99"". Rescheduling delivery for later."

The Internet Mail Service fails to determine whether "%s" is a substring or a
specification of a substring.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Disable SMTP protocol logging.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.
