-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you browse public folders anonymously using Outlook Web Access (OWA), you
may see 1219 events logged by the information store in Event Viewer on the
Exchange Server computer. The event contains information similar to the
following:

   Event ID: 1219
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: Logons

   Description:
   Logon Failure - insufficient user account information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The event ID 1219 is logged because OWA uses the Anonymous account permission
assigned to a public folder. You can view this using the HTTP Protocol
Properties dialog box in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.
Click the HTTP (Web) Site Settings object in the Protocols container under the
Configuration container, and click the Folder Shortcuts tab. Display the
properties of the selected public folder, and click Client Permissions.

Although the 1219 event is logged, the functionality of browsing public folders
anonymously is not affected. The event is merely a symptom of the information
store being unable to authenticate the logon because the Anonymous account is
being used.
