of each organization's directory, users with the same alias in each directory
may not get added to the Import container.

allows multiple Microsoft Exchange Server organizations to synchronize the
contents of their directories. To obtain this feature immediately, contact
Microsoft Product Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Product

Resource Kit (BORK), Second Edition. Microsoft Product Support Services will use
commercially reasonable efforts to support this product. Please do not confuse
the InterOrg Synchronization tool with the InterOrg Replication utility for
public folders, which is available on the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2 CD.
