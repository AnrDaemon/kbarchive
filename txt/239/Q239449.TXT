TITLE   :Err: Internet Explorer Can't Open the Site Https://<Sitename>...
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) certificates, the client attempting
to access the site with the HTTPS protocol may receive the following error
message:

IIS 4.0:

   Internet Explorer can't open the site https://<sitename>
   The supplied certificate is invalid.

IIS 5.0:

   The page cannot be displayed.
   Cannot find server or DNS Error.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Unlike non-SGC certificates, which allow the user to accept a
situation where the name used in the certificate does not match the name used in
the URL accessing the site, SGC certificates require that the names match. If
the names do not match, the error message is returned instead of a dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do the following:

1. Get a SGC certificate, which has a common name that matches the DNS name of
   the Web site.

2. Make a hosts file entry on the client computer to ensure that the common name
   is used.
