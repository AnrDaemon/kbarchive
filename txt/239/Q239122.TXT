The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open the Chap03.doc file in the
Docs\Word_Docs\Connectivity\Snads folder on the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM with
Word 2000, you are prompted with a File Conversion dialog box. If you attempt to
open the file in Word 95 or Word 97, the file appears corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

The Chap03.doc file is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To obtain the new file, Snads.rtf, you need to apply Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3 (SP3) for the Exchange SNADS Connector. To do so, you must run
Snaconn.exe from the Exchconn\Setup\I386\Snaconn folder on the SP3 CD-ROM.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
