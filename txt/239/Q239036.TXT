TITLE   :Stand-Alone Root Certificate Server May Not Appear in WSC Wizard
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you request, renew, or replace a server certificate using the Web Site
Certificate Wizard, your Certificate Services stand-alone Certificate Authority
may not appear in the list of online authorities.

CAUSE
=====

This only occurs if you are not using an Enterprise Certificate Authority
(Directory Services integrated).

WORKAROUND
==========

To create, renew, or replace a current certificate, you will need to use the
forms available through your local Web server. The default URL is
"http://server/certsrv" (where server is the local web server). Request a server
certificate, and then send the request in PCKS #10 format.

STATUS
======

This is a known issue in the Web Site Certificate Wizard that ships with
Internet Information Services 5.0.

Additional query words: iis certsrv certificate ca
