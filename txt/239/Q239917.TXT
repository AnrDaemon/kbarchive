SUMMARY
=======

You can use Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to run distributed
programs across multiple computers in a network. A distributed program consists
of multiple processes that cooperate to accomplish a task.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The processes can run on one or more computers. DCOM has four activation
models:

 - Launching user

 - Interactive user

 - This user

 - System

Terminal Server only supports launching user. This behavior is by design.
