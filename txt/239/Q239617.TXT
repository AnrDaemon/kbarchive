-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Interactive World Atlas 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Encarta World Atlas 2000, Setup may take a very long
time to finish.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions is true:

 - A real mode (16-bit) CD-ROM driver is installed on your computer.

 - Your CD-ROM drive is operating in MS-DOS Compatibility mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your hardware manufacturer to inquire about how
to obtain and install a protected mode (32-bit) CD-ROM driver for your CD-ROM
drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta World Atlas
2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if your CD-ROM drive is using a protected mode driver:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then verify that the File System entry is
   32-bit.

   If the File System entry is "Some drives are using MS-DOS compatibility," your
   CD-ROM drive may be using a real mode CD-ROM driver. If this is the case, you
   may not be able to read certain files on the CD-ROM.

4. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.
