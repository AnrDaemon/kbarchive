TITLE   :XCON: Internet Mail Service Incorrectly Routes Mail If Address S
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using an Internet Mail Service and have restrictions set to either
This Site or This Location, you may find that mail is incorrectly routed. This
occurs in the following circumstances:

 - You have an Exchange Server site that is geographically split with an
   Internet Mail Service in each site. Each server has the Server Location
   property set. The address space is "SMTP:*", but this has a restriction of
   "location."

 - You have two or more Exchange Server sites linked together and fully
   replicated. Each site has an Internet Mail Service and the address space is
   "SMTP:*", but this has a restriction of "site."

 - The expected behavior is that a message sent by a user in either the same
   site or that Internet Mail Service should send same location as the Internet
   Mail Service. However, the message is routed to a different Internet Mail
   Service in another site or location, and then sent out.


CAUSE
=====

The routing logic in the Internet Mail Service is not honoring the site or
location restrictions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

A workaround to this issue is to set the restrictions to be organization-wide.
However, this may not be suitable in every circumstance.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
