-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to, open, or locate a file with a long file name
(UNC), one of the following problems may occur:

Case 1: Advanced Search fails
-----------------------------

When you choose Find Now in the Advanced Find dialog box (on the File menu, click
Open and then click Advanced), Word finds no files, even though the files
actually exist in the location indicated. You can view the files in Windows
Explorer, and you can open the files in Word.

Case 2: Error with INCLUDE or INCLUDETEXT Field
-----------------------------------------------

The result of an INCLUDE or INCLUDETEXT field may display the following error
message:

   Error! Not a valid filename.

Case 3: Error with Modify Location dialog box
---------------------------------------------

The following error message appears when you select a folder on a UNC drive that
contains a space in the Modify Location dialog box:

   Not a valid directory.

NOTE: To open the Modify Location dialog box, click Options on the Tools menu,
click to select the File Locations tab, and then click Modify.

Case 4: Attaching data source to a mail merge main document fails
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When you try to attach a data source to a mail merge main document, no error
message appears, but the data file does not appear in the Mail Merge Helper
dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when there is a space in the path or in the name of a
file.
