The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Interactive World Atlas 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Encarta World Atlas 2000 on a Microsoft Windows 98
Second Edition-based computer, you may receive the following message:

   You are upgrading a version of Internet Explorer 5 in which the uninstall
   feature has been disabled. If you continue, Setup will update your PC with
   the newer version, but the uninstall feature will remain disabled.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run the installation program for Encarta World Atlas 2000, the
installation program starts Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 Setup to identify and
replace missing or outdated Internet Explorer components.

Because Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 is installed as a component of Windows 98
Second Edition and is required by Encarta World Atlas, you should not remove
it.
