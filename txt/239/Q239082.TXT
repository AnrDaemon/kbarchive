TITLE   :XIMS: IMAP4 Client Hangs Attempting to Append Message Using SSL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience either of the following symptoms:

 - When an Internet Mail Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4) client attempts to
   send a message to an Exchange Server computer using the APPEND command and
   Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication, the client may stop responding
   (hang). This problem is known to occur with Netscape Messenger version 4.5,
   but it may also occur with other clients.

 - After an IMAP4 client connects to an Exchange Server computer, the server may
   end the connection unexpectedly, or may not end the connection in situations
   where it should.

CAUSE
=====

These problems can occur for the following reasons:

 - If the server obtains the end of the message and a carriage return/line feed
   (CR/LF) during a single read, the CR/LF may be ignored, and therefore it is
   not decrypted. This causes the client to stop responding.

 - The server may not properly increment or decrement the counters associated
   with the receive chain length.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
