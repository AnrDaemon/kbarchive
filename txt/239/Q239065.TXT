TITLE   :XADM: Error Message: LDAP Authentication Method Is Not Supported
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Manager on a server running
Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2, and click the Server Selection tab, no
servers are listed, and you may receive the following error message:

   LDAP Authentication method is not supported

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have a computer running Exchange Server version 5.5 in the site, you can
configure Mailbox Manager from that server.

If you do not have any Exchange Server 5.5 computers in the site, you can still
run Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Manager on the 5.0 computer. Cleanup is performed
on mailboxes on that server, although you cannot see the server on the Server
Selection tab.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior also affects the retrieval of hidden mailboxes.
