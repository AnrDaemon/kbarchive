SYMPTOMS
========

When you set more than one property of a merged cell within a Word table through
a Range object of a Cell object, none of the changes is applied to the merged
cell.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, refresh the Cell object and Range object references
between the setting of a single property on a cell within a table with merged
cells. As illustrated in the following example code:

   Sub BuildTable()
     ' Create the table with merged cell
     ActiveDocument.Tables.Add Range:=Selection.Range, NumRows:=4, NumColumns:=4
     With ActiveDocument.Tables(1)
           .Cell(Row:=1, Column:=3).Merge _
           MergeTo:=.Cell(Row:=2, Column:=3)
          .Cell(Row:=2, Column:=1).Merge _
           MergeTo:=.Cell(Row:=4, Column:=2)
     End With
     shadecell
   End Sub

   Sub shadecell()
     Dim i As Integer
     Dim mycellrange As Range
     Dim startrange As Range
       For i = 1 To ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Range.Cells.Count
           Set mycellrange = ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Range.Cells(i).Range
           Set startrange = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=mycellrange.Start, _
             End:=mycellrange.Start)
           With startrange.Cells.Shading
             .BackgroundPatternColorIndex = wdBrightGreen
           End With
           'MsgBox "cell = " & i
       Next i
       For i = 1 To ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Range.Cells.Count
           Set mycellrange = ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Range.Cells(i).Range
           Set startrange = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=mycellrange.Start, _
             End:=mycellrange.Start)
           With startrange.Cells.Shading
             .Texture = wdTexture25Percent
           End With
       Next i
       For i = 1 To ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Range.Cells.Count
           Set mycellrange = ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Range.Cells(i).Range
           Set startrange = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=mycellrange.Start, _
             End:=mycellrange.Start)
           With startrange.Cells.Shading
             .ForegroundPatternColorIndex = wdAuto
           End With
       Next i
   End Sub
