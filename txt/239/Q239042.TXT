 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up or edit a Web site using the HTML Web Administration Forms that
come with Internet Information Services 5.0, an incorrect IP address may be
entered for the Web site's binding.

For example, if you are editing the properties of a Web site (or creating a new
one) and you set the IP address, you may enter a value like "1.1..1.1," which is
saved to the metabase. Note that you cannot enter an incorrect value in the
Internet Services Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This is due to a lack of validation in this Web form.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this situation, always double-check the values you enter into this
field.

STATUS
======

This is a known issue in the HTML Web Administration Forms that ship with
Internet Information Services 5.0.
