-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Create a component that implements IObjectConstruct::Construct. Configure the
component as a COM+ application and enable the object construction property, but
do not provide a constructor string.

Attempting to instantiate the COM+ object results in the following error:

   Error 8004e025 Automation Error
   COM+ Activation function failed because an initialization function failed.

WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround for this problem is to enter a dummy string or just spaces in the
Constructor String field.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior:
----------------------------

 - Create a component that derives from IObjectConstruct and implements
   IObjectConstruct::Construct but does not use a constructor string.

 - Configure this component in a COM+ Server Application such that object
   construction is enabled in Component Services but the constructor string is
   left blank.

To do this:

1. On the Start menu, select Programs, and then select Administrative Tools to
   launch Component Services.

2. Create a new COM+ Server Application under My Computer\COM+ Applications.

3. Install your component in this Application.

4. Right-click on this configured component and select Properties. Click the
   Activation tab.

5. Select the Enable Object Construction button and leave the Constructor String
   blank.

6. Try to create this component through a client application.

An error message is displayed saying:

   Error 8004e025 Automation Error
   COM+ Activation function failed because an initialization function failed.

If you just enter a dummy string or spaces for the constructor string, an
instance of the object can be created.
