OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbClient kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client components may be reinstalled during
the Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) periodic (30-day)
verification. Because all base and optional components are reinstalled,
components such as hardware and software inventory are taken regardless of your
schedule.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix:

1. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

2. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

3. Run Q239564.exe and follow the directions in the wizard.

This hotfix is one part of a set of two hotfixes. You should install both
hotfixes for best results. For additional information about the second hotfix,

Base:

After Q239564.exe is installed, allow the updated Compver.ini and Clicore.exe
files to be propagated to all Logon Points and Client Access Points (CAPS) in
the site.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the hotfixed
files to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process, use any of the
following methods:

 - Stop and restart the SMS Client Service on each client. For Microsoft Windows
   NT, simply stop and restart the service. For Microsoft Windows 95 or
   Microsoft Windows 98, a restart is required.

 - Create a software distribution for one of the Resource Kit tools (Setevnt.exe
   or Cliutils.exe), along with the appropriate parameters to start a CCIM work
   cycle. The tools are located on SMS 2.0 CD-ROM 2.

   For Setevnt.exe the syntax is:

   setevnt /q

For Cliutils.exe, the syntax is:

   Cliutils KICK "Client Configuration Installation Manager"

 - If you have the Networking Logon Client Installation option enabled, have
   users log off and back on.

 - Have users run SMSMan manually.

NOTE: Windows 95/98 clients may require a restart after the hotfixed files have
been installed to receive full hotfix functionality. To verify this, review the
Clicore.log file after the update. If a restart is required, the entry listed
below will be logged. Because of the nature of this hotfix, Microsoft recommends
that a mandatory restart policy be used for all Windows 95/98 users after the
hotfix has been applied.

   Reboot required - disabling component until reboot
