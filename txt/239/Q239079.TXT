PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4,4.0 SP5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT4sp6fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5

SYMPTOMS
========

After you update a DNS server with INT zone file(s) containing WINS Lookup
record(s) in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4, the DNS service does not
start and the System Event log contains the following entries:

   Event ID 1501 "DNS Server could not parse database file %1 for zone %2.
   Event ID 1503 "DNS Server could not parse database file %1 line %2.

You receive the following error messages if you start the DNS Service from an
MS-DOS command prompt:

   The Microsoft DNS Server service is starting.
   The Microsoft DNS Server service could not be started.
   A system error has occurred.
   System error 13 has occurred.
   The data is invalid.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the zone file does not contain WINS Lookup records. The
DNS service may start, but the zone is treated as Reverse. As a result, name
resolution of hosts contained in the zone do not resolve and it may not be
possible to add new records to the zone file using the DNS user interface. This
is because the INT zone file was not recognized as Forward when the DNS service
was started.
