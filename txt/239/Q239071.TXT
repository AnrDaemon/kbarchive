TITLE   :XADM: Installing Exchange Server Mailbox Manager on a BDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5,5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you run Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager Setup on a Backup Domain
Controller (BDC), you get the following informational message after you provide
the service account name and password.

   Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager setup was unable to assign the
   service account the Log on as Service right because this machine is acting as
   a Backup Domain Controller for your network. Please use the Windows NT User
   Manager to confirm that the Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager service
   account has the Log on as Service right.

This message is displayed even if the service account has all the required
rights.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is expected. When the Mailbox Manager Setup program is run on a
BDC, it is not able to assign privileges to the account used as the service
account. The message above is a reminder that you should verify that the service
account correctly has the "Log On As A Service" privilege.
