SUMMARY
=======

It is frequently good security practice to require Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
for certain pages on a Web site. Although this can be configured through the
Internet Services Manager (ISM) in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), you
can also use Active Server Pages (ASP) to force SSL for specific pages without
making changes in the MMC.

Prerequisites
-------------

This article assumes the following conditions:

 - IIS is running on standard ports:

    - HTTP = Port 80

    - HTTPS = Port 443

 - IIS has a valid SSL certificate installed.

 - The Web site or virtual server that is used does not use HTTP/1.1 host
   headers for name resolution.

Forcing SSL using ASP
---------------------

To force SSL using ASP, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "Notepad" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

2. Paste the following code into a blank Notepad document. On the File menu,
   click Save As, and then save the following code in the root of your Web
   server as an include file named ForceSSL.inc:

   <%
      If Request.ServerVariables("SERVER_PORT")=80 Then
         Dim strSecureURL
         strSecureURL = "https://"
         strSecureURL = strSecureURL & Request.ServerVariables("SERVER_NAME")
         strSecureURL = strSecureURL & Request.ServerVariables("URL")
         Response.Redirect strSecureURL
      End If
   %>

3. For each page that requires SSL, paste the following code at the top of the
   page to reference the include file from the previous step:

   <%@Language="VBSCRIPT"%>
   <!--#include virtual="/ForceSSL.inc"-->

When each page is browsed, the ASP code that is contained in the include file
detects the port to determine if HTTP is used. If HTTP is used, the browser will
be redirected to the same page by using HTTPS.
