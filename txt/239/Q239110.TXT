PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Service Pack 4 (SP4) for Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition, the fixes and added functionality for the DHCP Server service
are not available.

CAUSE
=====

SP4 does not copy the updated Dhcpssvc.dll file to the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, extract the SP4 files and copy the newer Dhcpssvc.dll
file to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder:

1. Type "wtsi386.exe /x" (without the quotation marks) or "wtsalpha.exe /x"
   (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt.

2. In the "Choose Directory for Extracted Files" box, type the full path of the
   folder into which you want to extract the files.

   NOTE: Do not extract the files into the %SystemRoot% or %SystemRoot%\System32
   folder.

3. Click OK, and then click OK.

   Note that the extracted files require substantial disk space.

4. Copy the current Dhcpssvc.dll file to another name or location.

5. Copy the newer (dated 3/30/1999) Dhcpssvc.dll file to the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Terminal Server Service Pack 4.
