PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbsms200sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your path contains network drives and you have a Novell NetWare redirector
installed (either Microsoft Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Novell
intraNetWare Client version 4.5 or earlier), you may experience connection
attempts to those network drives using SMSCliToknAcct. These connection attempts
can lead to SMSCliToknAcct being locked out if an account lockout policy is
enabled for the domain.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

NOTE: This hotfix only addresses the problem if you have Microsoft CSNW
installed. To resolve this problem if you have Novell IntraNetWare client
installed, upgrade to the latest version of the redirector.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove all network drives from the path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps at the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.

2. Replace the Ccmcore.exe file in the
   <SMS_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\i386 folder with the version
   obtained from the hotfix.

3. Replace the Clicore.exe file in the
   <SMS_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\i386 folder with the version
   obtained from the hotfix.

4. Replace the Compver.ini file in the <SMS_root>\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base
   folder with the version obtained from the hotfix.

5. Replace the Bindsvrn.dll file in the <SMS_root>\Bin\i386 folder with
   the version obtained from the hotfix.

6. Replace the Ndssvrn.dll file in the <SMS_root>\Bin\i386 folder with the
   version obtained from the hotfix.

7. Replace the Mslmclin.dll file in the <SMS_root>\Bin\i386 folder with
   the version obtained from the hotfix.

8. Start the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the files that
are in this hotfix to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process,
you can stop and then restart the SMS Client Service on each client. You can
also create a software distribution by using the Setevnt.exe or the Cliutils.exe
Resource Kit tools. You must include the appropriate parameters to start a CCIM
work cycle. For information about the proper syntax for these tools, see the
Resource Kit documentation.
