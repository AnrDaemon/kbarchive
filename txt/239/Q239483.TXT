-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Web browser clients may receive the following error message:

   Cannot open Internet site http://<site name>.
   A connection to the server could not be established

CAUSE
=====

When executed, CGI applications run in their own memory space on a Web server.
Each CGI application uses an IIS I/0 thread. By default, IIS is set to use a
maximum of 256 I/O threads.

If a CGI application stops responding or is experiencing a slow connection when
performing data access, then users may reissue requests to the CGI application.
CGI applications cannot be written to stop when the Web client ends the
connection and will continue to run on the server. By default, CGI scripts will
time out after 300 seconds.

When CGI execution does not complete under heavy load, all of the IIS I/O threads
may be used. This can cause the above error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Re-create CGI applications as ISAPI applications. Correctly written ISAPI
applications can use a separate thread pool to handle requests and will use IIS
I/O threads and memory much more efficiently, and allow for greater scalability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS does not terminate CGI applications when a HTTP connection is ends.

Additional query words: iis cgi
