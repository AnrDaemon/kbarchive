TITLE   :Unreadable Text in Regional Settings After Language Pack Install
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add multiple language support on your computer and you view Regional
Settings in Control Panel, unreadable text (for example, a box or vertical line)
may be displayed in certain fields. Unreadable text may also be displayed in
other windows or programs where you would expect to see normal text.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the files in the Langpack folder enable the use of
non-English characters in documents and e-mail messages. However, the default
system font is still used for the Windows NT user interface. Because the default
system font is not capable of displaying all multiple language characters,
unreadable text is displayed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
