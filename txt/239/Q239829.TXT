SUMMARY
=======

You can uninstall the data link control (DLC) protocol only by using the
graphical user interface (GUI). This method is not efficient or flexible if you
want to uninstall the DLC protocol on many computers. However, you can automate
the uninstallation using the Setup.exe file located in the %SystemRoot%\System32
folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To uninstall the DLC protocol, you must first uninstall the protocol and then
update the bindings using the following steps:

1. Create a batch or script file and give it a name (for example, Unistdlc.bat).

2. Make sure the Oemnxpdl.inf file is available in the %SystemRoot%\System32
   folder.

3. Type the following commands into the batch file:

   cd %SystemRoot%
   setup.exe /f /i%SystemRoot%\system32\ncpashel.inf /t NTN_InstallMode =
   deinstall /t NTN_Origination = deinstall /t NTN_Infname =
   %SystemRoot%\system32\oemnxpdl.inf /t NTN_SRCPATH = %SystemRoot%\system32 /T
   NTN_Infoption = DLC

NOTE: The command line that begins with "Setup.exe" must be on one line without a
carriage return (CR) or line feed (LF). It is wrapped in this article for
readability purposes.

4. Save and close the batch file.

5. Run the batch file to uninstall the DLC protocol.

6. Update the bindings by running the Runncpa.exe tool from Microsoft BackOffice
   SNA Server at a command prompt.


7. Restart your computer.
