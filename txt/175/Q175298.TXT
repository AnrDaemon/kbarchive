TITLE   :XADM: System Attendant Started After Running Restore
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program in forklift mode (setup
/r) and then restore using NTBackup with the Start Services After Restore option
unchecked, NTBackup will start the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.

This is by design. NTBackup requires that the System Attendant (MAD.EXE) be
running. Therefore, it starts the service.
