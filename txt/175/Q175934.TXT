TITLE   :Schedule+ Time Zone Transition Dates Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0,7.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.5, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Appointments between the last Sunday in September and the last Sunday in October
may appear one hour off from the expected time. This occurs in specific time
zones that have changed the transition dates for entering and leaving Daylight
Savings Time.

The same symptoms can occur during the period from the first Sunday in March to
the last Sunday in March.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ uses an internal table to store transition times for each individual
time zone. When a governing body decides to change transition dates, the tables
no longer agree with the dates observed in the time zone.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Schedule+ version 7.0 and 7.5.

For Schedule+ 7.0, this problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97 Service
Release 2 (SR-2).

For Schedule+ 7.5, this problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Service Pack
2 - Client update.

For additional information about SR-2, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
