TITLE   :SNA Server Leaks Memory If Detailed Logging Is Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft SNA Server Default Audit Log Level is set for Detailed Problem
Analysis, a memory leak occurs every time a new client connects to SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Snadmod.dll file determines the client's logon username and
domain name each time a client connects to SNA Server. If the user has already
connected, then this information is retrieved from a local cache. If the user
has not connected, the Snadmod.dll file calls the Win32 LookupAccountSid()
function to retrieve this information. The problem occurs because Snadmod.dll
continues to use LookupAccountSid even though the user exists in the local
cache. In this case, memory that was allocated for the LookupAccountSid function
is not released.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
