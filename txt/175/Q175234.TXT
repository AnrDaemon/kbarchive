======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help
topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

While using a Control Panel utility to install an OEM third-party device driver
for a new Tape or SCSI device, you get a USAGE popup message screen as follows:

 --------------------------------------------------
| Usage                                            |
|------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft Setup                                  |
|                                                  |
| Setup [/?][/F][/I<INF SRC FILE>]                 |
|       [/C <Script Section>][/s SRC PATH>]        |
|                                                  |
| /? - generates this usage message.               |
| /F - Turns off blue background                   |
| /I - defaults to current working Dir + Setup.inf |
| /c - defaults to shell commands                  |
| /s - defaults to current working directory       |
| /t - set INF <var> to <value>. Multiple /T valid |
| /v - turn on INF syntax checking.                |
|__________________________________________________|

This problem occurs after you select the device name you want to install as
defined in the third party Oemsetup.inf file, but before being prompted for the
path to install the driver from, which is usually the floppy drive.

Installing a built-in supported driver from the drop down list will install
without problems, this error only occurs while using an OEM driver.

CAUSE
=====

The registry value for SourcePath contains a LONG directory name containing a
space(s).

Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup

SourcePath:REG_SZ:C:\Directory Name
( no spaces allowed.)

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

   Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup

2. Double-click the value: Sourcepath:RE_SZ:directory name.

3. Either remove the present entry, or remove the spaces from the path.

4. Quit Registry Editor and run the Control Panel utility to install your
   third-party driver. The driver should install properly.
