TITLE   :BUG: Error Msg Applying Service Pack 3 in Unattended Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are doing an unattended installation of Windows NT Service Pack 3 (SP3)
by issuing a update -u command, the user may get a pop-up message that states
the file being copied is older than the one currently on the hard drive. The
error message is as follows:

   Source D:\i386\filename.exe Target C:\winnt\system32\filename.exe

   The target file exists and is newer than the source.

   Overwrite the newer file?

   No No to All Yes

CAUSE
=====

This can occur when a .DLL file has been updated from an application such as
Internet Explorer or possibly an updated network card driver from the hardware
manufacturer. The latest driver is already on the system and SP3 is trying to
prompt to overwrite the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

 

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
