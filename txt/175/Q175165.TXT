TITLE   :XADM: Changes to Internet Mail Service Wizard Cannot Be Saved
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program may allow the Internet Mail Wizard
to run, but you may not be allowed to save changes to the Microsoft Exchange
Directory. The Internet Mail Wizard will give you the option of waiting until
replication completes, but after it is finished, the only option within the
Internet Mail Wizard is Cancel. This deletes the Internet Mail Service that you
are trying to create.

CAUSE
=====

After you add a Microsoft Exchange Server computer to an existing Microsoft
Exchange site and start the directory replication process to update the
directory on the new Exchange Server computer, the process may take a long time
and you will not be allowed to make certain directory modifications in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

RESOLUTION
==========

You need to wait until directory replication is complete before running the
Internet Mail Wizard. This may take some time, depending on the amount of
information that needs to be replicated.
