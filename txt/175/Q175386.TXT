IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it

the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to move the Event Logs to another partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are auditing a lot of information, you may need to move the Event Log
files from the system partition to another partition. By default, they are
stored in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Config folder.

The location and also the name of the log files are stored in the registry. By
altering this information, you can change the location of the log files.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog

2. Select the log file you want to change. To change the location of the Audit
   Log, select Security.

3. Under the key of the log file you wish to change, double-click the value File
   (type REG_EXPAND).

4. Edit the path in the String Editor to point to the new location.

   NOTE: The path must exist and you must include the file name.

   The default names are:

                   Security:    Secevent.evt
                   Application: Appevent.evt
                   System:      Sysevent.evt

5. Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer.
