SUMMARY
=======

LED.EXE is a Visual Basic control that emulates a light-emitting diode display,
such as those found in digital clocks and meters. The user can either assign a
Value to the LED, which will be displayed, or the user can actually assign a
ValueMask to the LED, which allows for turning on individual segments of the
LED. You can turn on any of the seven individual segments to allow you to
display letters or numbers.

The project for this control can be downloaded from the Visual Basic Owner's site
at http://premium.microsoft.com/download/vbasic/led.exe. Only registered users
of Visual Basic can access this site.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an excerpt from the readme.txt shipped with the sample that
covers some of the technical details of this sample.

Definitions
-----------

The following properties are available with the LED control:

 - LEDColorOn - Assigns the OLE_Color that will be used for the LED segments
   that are on.

 - LEDColorOff - Assigns the OLE_Color that will be used for the LED segments
   that are off.

 - ShowBorder - A Boolean that indicates whether or not to draw a border around
   the control.

 - ShowDecimal - A Boolean that indicates whether or not the decimal indicator
   is on or off.

 - ShowDigit - A Boolean that indicates whether the entire LED should be on or
   off. Setting this to False will provide a "clear" LED, with all segments
   being set to off.

   NOTE: This does not effect the decimal; use the ShowDecimal to turn the
   decimal off.

 - Value - An integer that holds the value of the LED. If ValueIsMask is set to
   False, then the range of Value is 0 to 9. If ValueIsMask is set to True, then
   the range of Value is 0 to 127.

 - ValueIsMask - A Boolean that indicates whether the Value property will be
   used as a single-digit to display on the LED, or that Value is actually a
   binary-mask, indicating which segments on the LED are to be "turned on".

LED Display
-----------

This is a diagram of the "mask values" for the LED:

          ---1---
         |       |
         |       |
         8       16
         |       |
         |       |
          ---2---
         |       |
         |       |
         32      64
         |       |
         |       |
          ---4---

To create a "unique" display, just add up the numbers for the segments that you
want turned on, set ValueIsMask to True, and assign the value to Value. A few
examples would be:

      A      123
      C       45
      E       47
      F       43
      H      122
      -        2
      _        4
