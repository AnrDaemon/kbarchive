SYMPTOMS

In the Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, when you compose a meeting
request or appointment that includes an attachment, the file size of the
attachment is incorrectly displayed as 1 KB. This may occur regardless of the
actual size of the attachment. However, the recipient of the meeting request or
appointment will see the correct size displayed for the attachment.

version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
