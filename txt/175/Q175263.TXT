TITLE   :XADM: Clients Cannot Recover Items After Item Recovery Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

Item Recovery can be enabled or disabled for the private or public information
store objects, a specific mailbox, or a specific public folder. However, changes
made to the Item Recovery settings may not be immediately available to clients
that are currently logged on to the Exchange Server computer.

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange clients may be unable to see deleted
items in the Recover Deleted Items From dialog box, even if the Item Recovery
option has been enabled on the Exchange Server computer. Conversely, clients may
be able to recover deleted items even if the Item Recovery option has been
disabled on the server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

After you make changes to the Item Recovery settings on the Exchange Server
computer, you must perform one of the following actions before clients can
recover deleted items:

 - Restart the Outlook or Exchange client.

   -or-

 - Stop and restart the Microsoft Exchange information store service.

   -or-

 - Wait for approximately an hour to allow the changes on the server to be
   registered by the client.
