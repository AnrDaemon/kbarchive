PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SQL Server Upsizing Wizard keeps the table structure of the table selected
originally in Step 4 - Map Field Data Types even though the selected table was
removed from the upsizing list by going back to Step 3 - Choose Tables and
removing the table from the Selected Tables list.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select the table that is not going to be removed from the Table list in Step 4
before going back to Step 3 to remove the table.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

2. Select Testdata.dbc from the HOME()+"samples\data" folder in Step 1.

3. Choose the tables Customer and Orders on Step 3 - Choose Tables.

4. Select Orders in the Table drop-down box in Step 4. The grid will then
   display the table structure for Orders.
