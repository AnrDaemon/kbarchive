TITLE   :Batch Files Run from Within Other Folders May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a batch file from a different folder that contains non- alphabetic
characters, you will receive the following error message:

   The name specified is not recognized as an internal or external command,
   operable program or batch file.

Steps to reproduce the problem:

1. Create a folder named test(2) off your root directory.

2. Create a batch file in the test(2) folder called test.bat.

3. Insert the following lines in test.bat:

         echo off
         pause

4. Save test.bat.

5. From the root directory at a command prompt, run the batch file with the
   following line:

   \test(2)\test.bat

Notice the error message received:

   The name specified is not recognized as an internal or external command,
   operable program or batch file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Although the batch file does not run from the root directory, the command will
run if you enclose the command line within quotes. For example, for the above
situation, a user should enter the following line in a command prompt:

   "\test(2)\test.bat"

This command will run the batch file normally.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
