TITLE   :XWEB: OWA Send Does Not Work After Canceling Security Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a message using the Outlook Web Access client on a
Windows 3.x system, the Send button does not work.

CAUSE
=====

If you use Microsoft Internet Explorer, this problem occurs after you click the
Send button. The browser security dialog then displays the following message:

   You are about to send information over the Internet. It might be
   possible for other people to see what you are sending. Do you want to
   continue?

If you click "No" before sending, the Send button no longer functions.

If you use Netscape Navigator, a security dialog similar to the following is
displayed:

   Any information you submit is insecure and could be observed by a third
   party while in transit. If you are submitting passwords, credit card
   numbers, or other information you would be safer to cancel this
   submission.

If you cancel the transmission, the Send button no longer functions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
