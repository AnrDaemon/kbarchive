TITLE   :XWEB: Outlook Web Access Fields Run Off the Browser Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Using a Unix based web browser with Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) can
result in typeable fields running off the screen into non-viewable areas.

CAUSE
=====

The OWA code for Unix browsers assumes Times Roman 12 for proportional fonts and
Courier 10 for fixed width fonts. If a client is not set to use these fonts, the
above display problem may occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
