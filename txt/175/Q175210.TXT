TITLE   :FP: Search Finds No Documents if Title Length > 254 Characters
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:1.0; WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you submit a search form, the search results indicate that no documents
meeting your criteria were found.

CAUSE
=====

A search will fail if the title of the page exceeds 254 characters. The
Microsoft FrontPage 97 Server Extensions use an internal Wide Area Internet
Search (WAIS) engine to perform keyword searches throughout a Web. The WAIS
search engine creates a list of file names that will become corrupted if it
finds a page title greater than 254 characters. As a result, the FrontPage
Server extensions don't recognize the list of file names during the WAIS
verification and the Search component displays a "No documents found" message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, edit the page in FrontPage Editor, and do the
following:

1. On the File menu, click Open.

2. Click the Current FrontPage Web tab.

3. Select the page you want to edit and click Open.

4. Right-click anywhere on the page (Windows) or hold down SHIFT and click the
   page (Macintosh). Click Page Properties on the menu that appears.

5. In the Title box, enter a title that is fewer than 254 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage
98 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the FrontPage 97 server extensions are also capable of working with
Microsoft Index Server. Microsoft Index Server does not display the problem
described in this article. When using the Microsoft Index Server, the form
action within the HTML code will point to a _vti_bin/<form>.idq file,
where <form> is the name and number of the search form.
