TITLE   :XADM: Exact Name Resolution Fails with First and Last Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to resolve a name using an exact match, name resolution may fail on
firstname/lastname combination. This happens when, for example, you use the
equal sign and first and last name combination:

   =John Sharp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

If there is only one unique match, the name resolution succeeds. The exact name
resolution of Exchange Client version 5.0 does not appear to work for mailbox
names with a blank in it.
