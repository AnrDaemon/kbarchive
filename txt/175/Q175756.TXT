TITLE   :PRB: Setup Wizard Displays Message Box with '118' and OK Button
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp500 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Setup Wizard displays a message box with '118' and an OK button.

CAUSE
=====

The Environment User Variable TMP under Windows NT4.0 does not point to a valid
directory (usually the Temp directory).

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a valid (Temp) directory for the TMP Environment User Variable. From
Control Panel, double-click on the System icon. Click on the Environment tab.
Under "User Variables for [UserName]," change the value of TMP to an existing
directory name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. From Control Panel, double-click on the System icon.

2. Click on the Environment tab.

3. Under "User Variables for [UserName]," change the value of TMP to a
   non-existing directory name, or delete or rename the existing directory.

4. Start Visual Basic with a Standard EXE project (or any other project).

5. Compile the project. (You don't have to add any code.)

6. Run Application Setup Wizard with the project. You will get several message
   boxes, each with '118' and an OK button.

To correct this behavior, assign the TMP variable a valid directory.
