TITLE   :XCLN: Non-Creator of Public Folder Cannot Remove Self as Owner
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The creator of a public folder is the only one who can remove other owners from
within the Permissions page. When other owners try to remove themselves, their
changes are silently not applied. After a non-creator selects OK or Apply, the
properties for this owner are changed from Owner to Custom (with Owner
properties).

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.
