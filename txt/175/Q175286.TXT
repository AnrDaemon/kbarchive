TITLE   :XADM: Clicking Title Bar of Directory Import Pauses Import
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

During a bulk import operation in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program,
if you click the Directory Import dialog box's title bar and hold the mouse
button down, the import process will pause.

CAUSE
=====

The import operation pauses because a message is sent to the system telling it
to move the dialog box, which causes the screen updates to freeze. The progress
dialog and the actual import process are handled by the same thread.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
