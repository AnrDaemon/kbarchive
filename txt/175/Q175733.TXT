TITLE   :XADM: Key Normalization Problem Causes Stack Corruption
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

We cannot list any specific symptoms that you may encounter because the behavior
of Exchange Server is unpredictable when this problem occurs.

CAUSE
=====

Under certain circumstances, while formulating a key, Exchange Server will write
to a random area on the stack. This occurs if the following steps occur:

1. Exchange Server is in the middle of formulating a key, but it has less than 9
   bytes left in keyspace.

2. The next column to normalize is a binary column.

3. Can't fit the binary column.

At this point, Exchange Server encounters the problem and writes to a random area
on the stack. If there are no more columns in the index, it likely avoids the
problem because it exits the function. However, if there are more columns in the
index, it stays in the function to examine the remaining columns. At this point,
the stack has been corrupted and unpredictable behaviour ensues. This problem is
likely to be hit if an index contains many columns.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
