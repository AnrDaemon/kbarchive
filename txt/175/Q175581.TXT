TITLE   :XWEB: Err Msg: You Can Only Submit a File That Has a Data Fork
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to attach a file using Netscape Navigator version 3.01 for
Macintosh to access the Outlook Web Access client, the following error occurs:

   You can only submit a file that has a data fork.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem with Netscape Navigator version 3.01. This error occurs
because Netscape Navigator does no encoding of the attachment. Encoding is
necessary to preserve the resource fork.

WORKAROUND
==========

For attachments to work properly, use a Web browser that can preserve the
resource fork. Internet Explorer version 3.01 or higher, or Netscape
Communicator version 4.03 will work successfully.
