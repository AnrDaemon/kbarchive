SYMPTOMS
========

An application error occurs when a Visual Basic program dynamically creates a
text box bound to a remote data control or a data control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual Basic, version
5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This section shows you how to reproduce the bug in Visual Basic 4.0 using a data
control. You can substitute a remote data control for a data control and still
reproduce the behavior.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0 or, if it is already running, click New Project
   on the File menu.

2. Add the following controls to Form1 and set the following properties to the
   appropriate controls:

   Control           Default Name     Property            Setting
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Command Button    Command1

   Data              Data1            DatabaseName        Biblio.mdb
                                      RecordSource        Authors

   Text Box          Text1            DataSource          Data1
                                      Index               0

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Command1.Caption = "For Remote Data Control"
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim count As Integer
            Dim i As Integer
            Static lastcount As Integer

            Data1.Refresh
            count = 4

            If lastcount > 0 Then
               For i = lastcount - 1 To 1 Step -1
                  Unload text1(i)
               Next i
            End If

            If count > 0 Then
               For i = 1 To count - 1
                  Load text1(i)
                  text1(i).Left = text1(0).Left + (i * 1335)
                  text1(i).Visible = True
               Next i
            End If
            lastcount = count
         End Sub

4. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. Each
   time you click the command button, three text boxes appear. On the third
   click, an application error occurs displaying one of the following messages
   and Visual Basic ends:


   Windows NT 3.51:

   being generated.VB32.exe.
