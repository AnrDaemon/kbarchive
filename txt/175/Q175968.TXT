TITLE   :XCLN: Windows 3.x Client Fails to Send to SMTP Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client will not be able to send a message to
an SMTP address. When you try to resolve the address, you will see the following
error message:

   The action could not be completed.

When you try send the message, you will see the following error message:

   The item could not be sent. The client operation failed.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client is attempting to locate the name in
the Global Address List (GAL) and is failing when passed a container type that
is not expected. The problem occurs on Microsoft Exchange Servers that contain a
large number of containers (approximately 200+ depending on size of the
container's MAPI properties and their nesting level).

WORKAROUND
==========

The resolution of the name is successful if you use the one-off syntax. For
example:

   [SMTP:User@Company.com]

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Windows
3.x client, version 5.0.
