PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500bug kbvfp600fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a combo box that has a narrow column width and ItemTips property is set to
true (.T.), the ItemTips window prevents the selection of a choice from the list
of values in the combo box.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not use the ItemTips by retaining its default
setting of False (.F.) or by using the Alt+DownArrow key on the keyboard to
select a choice from the combo box list.

You will notice that the ItemTips do not display if you use the keyboard to
select a choice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
version 6.0

MORE INFORMATION
================

ItemTips is a new property in Visual FoxPro version 5.0 that applies to combo
box and list box objects. An item tip is a small window that displays an entire
combo box or list box item when the mouse pointer is positioned over the item.
Whenever items in a combo box or list box control are longer than the width of
the control, setting the ItemTips property to true (.T.) displays the entire
text of the item, similar to ToolTips in a toolbar.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Add any table to the Data Environment of the form.

3. Add a ComboBox object as Combo1.

4. Set the RowSourceType property to 6 - Fields.

5. Set the RowSource property to any table field.

6. Set the ColumnCount property to 2.

7. Set the ColumnWidths property to 10,10.

8. Select the InteractiveChange event, and double-click to open a code window.
   Enter the following code into the Combo1.InteractiveChange window:

         This.DisplayValue=This.Value
         This.Refresh

9. Set the ItemTips property to .T. - True.

10. Run the form. Notice that the choices in the drop-down list are displayed in
   a very narrow column, and that when you place your mouse pointer over a
   choice that the Item Tips displays the complete text of the choice; however,
   when you select a choice nothing is displayed in the combo box. In order to
   see the problem, be sure to wait until the item tip is displayed before
   clicking the mouse to make a choice.

To prove that the ItemTips property prevents the item chosen in the drop- down
list box from showing as the display value, just modify the form and set the
Combo1.ItemTips property to .F. - False (Default) and re-run the form. Notice
that the full text of the choice cannot be seen; however, the selection chosen
appears in the combo box.
