TITLE   :XFOR: Outbound SMTP Mail Never Leaves Microsoft Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages are not sent out over the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail
Service (IMS), they remain in the queue. It may look like the IMS is not
functioning and restarting it will resolve this problem.

If you dump the status of the TCP connections to the Microsoft Exchange Server
using the NETSTAT command, you will see several connections that are in the
established state. You may also notice that these connections have been
established for a long time.

CAUSE
=====

Once a TCP connection is established, the IMS will timeout (5 minutes is the
default time period) waiting for the banner to be sent. If the Banner doesn't
arrive during this time, the IMS should terminate the connection and clean up
the Socket. In this case, the connection count against the destination domain is
being leaked and as a result, the IMS never terminates the connection and cleans
up the socket.

STATUS
======

version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
