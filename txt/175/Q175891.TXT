PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 is configured to support Outlook Web
Access (OWA) clients, the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) must be
configured for Anonymous and (Basic) Clear Text authentication, but only if IIS
and Exchange Server are not located on the same computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For directory and information store access, the OWA client establishes a MAPI
login to the Exchange Server computer that it is connected to. When NTLM
authentication is enabled on the IIS server, OWA can only access information on
the local server. Any attempts to access information on other folders, such as
public folders and/or Schedule+ Free/Busy information will fail.

Additional query words: IIS OWA NTLM exfaqold failed inbox
