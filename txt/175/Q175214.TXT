SUMMARY
=======

DirWalk is an OCX that can be used as either a control placed on a form or as a
stand-alone ActiveX server using the CreateObject method. The control is used to
walk a directory tree and executes the ItemFound event every time a file
matching the specified criteria is found. The control continues to walk the tree
until either the entire drive is searched or the fCancel parameter on the
ItemFound event is set to True.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The project for this control can be downloaded from the Visual Basic Owner's sit
at: http://premium.microsoft.com/download/vbasic/DirWalk.exe. Only registered
users of Visual Basic can access this site.
