TITLE   :FIX: ActiveX MAPI Control 5.0 Causes Memory Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINNT:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp600fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a MAPISession control version 5.0 or a MAPIMessages control version
5.0 to a form and then edit the (Messaging Application Programming Interface)
MAPI control properties, a memory corruption error appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

One possible resolution is to copy the older Msmapi32.ocx version 1.0.2815 from
another computer that is currently running Visual FoxPro version 5.0 or extract
the file from the Visual FoxPro 5.0 install disks.

For additional information on using the extract utility, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q135518 HOWTO: Copy Files from Cabinets on DMF-Formatted Disks

NOTE: This resolution will only work as long as another application does not
install version 5.0 of the Msmapi32.ocx over version 1.0.2815. These
applications may include Visual Basic version 5.0, Visual FoxPro for Windows
version 5.0a or an executable file created by one of these applications.

NOTE: This error has not been corrected in Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once you try to edit or make changes to any of the MAPISession control or
MAPIMessages control specific properties, the following error is displayed:

   OLE Idispatch exception code 0 from MAPISession: Property is write-only.

   -or-

   OLE Idispatch exception code 0 from MAPIMessages: Property is write-only.

This will not prevent the control from being edited. Click OK and then
right-click the control to display the short-cut menu. Choose MAPISession or
MAPIMessage Properties to open the Property Pages dialog box. Change one of the
properties then click Apply or OK. In Windows 95, the following error message
appears:

   This program performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

After clicking the Details push button, the following message appears:

   VFP caused and invalid pagefault in module KERNEL32.DLL at <register
   address>.

In Windows NT 4.0, the following error appears:

   An application error had occurred and an application error log is being
   generated. VFP.EXE Exception: access violation.

NOTE: If you get this error multiple times, the error log file may get larger.
You may delete the User.dmp file to free up the space used by this log file.
