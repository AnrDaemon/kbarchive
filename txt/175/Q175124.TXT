TITLE   :XADM: Error Message "The file mqrt.dll was not found."
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the server is started and Microsoft Exchange Server services are started or
when the services are stopped and restarted you may receive the following error
message:

   The file mqrt.dll was not found.

The applications that trigger this message are as follows and occur in this
order

   Dsamain.exe
   Store.exe
   Emsmta.exe
   Msaexcimc.exe

and then an OleWinMainThread function.

Although this error message is generated, Exchange Server functionality is not
impaired. All services start and function properly.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) was installed
and improperly uninstalled.

The errors occur because Microsoft Exchange Server checks for the following
registry key

   \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ServerProtocols\ncadg_mq

and the client related key

   \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ClientProtocols\ncadg_mq

Both of these keys should have been removed using the uninstall process.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove these two keys and the error message should stop appearing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The release version of MSMQ is included with Microsoft Windows NT Server
Enterprise edition and is referred to as the Enterprise Edition. This is a tool
for developing asynchronous, store-and-forward applications.

The Exchange Connector runs with Microsoft Exchange versions 4.0 or 5.0

The setup process includes setting up an Exchange mailbox of type MSMQ. The
mailbox points to an MSMQ queue and forwards all the mail to the queue as
messages. This process uses the MSMQ API set.

Microsoft Message Queue Server is a fast store-and-forward service for Microsoft
Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition that requires Microsoft SQL Server version
6.5 to store the Message Queue Information Store (MQIS).
