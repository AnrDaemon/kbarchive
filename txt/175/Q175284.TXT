TITLE   :XADM: Remove All Does Not Remove JET Performance Counters

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When you run Microsoft Exchange Server setup and you carry out a Remove All
command, the JET (ESE) performance counters are not removed. This is by
design. JET is now used by the Windows NT version 5.0 directory, DHCP, and
WINS components; therefore, the counters cannot be removed.
