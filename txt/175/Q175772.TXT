SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange client, you may receive the following
error message:

   The MAPI spooler could not be started. Close and then restart all mail-
   enabled applications. MAPI 1.0 [000004C7].

Necessary components of the Exchange client may have been removed during the
uninstall process. This error can occur when Microsoft Outlook is installed in
the same directory as an existing Microsoft Exchange client and then
subsequently uninstalled.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you do not intend to reinstall Microsoft Outlook, run the Microsoft Exchange
Setup program and select the Reinstall option. Otherwise, you can just install
Microsoft Outlook again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you plan on running Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook on the same
computer, it is recommended that you install them in separate directories.


Additional query words: remove all shared components
