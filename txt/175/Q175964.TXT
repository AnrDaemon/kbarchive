TITLE   :XCON: MTA Stops Processing Messages and Generates Event ID 210
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) might stop processing
messages and report an access violation when it receives a message from a
foreign X.400 MTA. The Microsoft Exchange Server will generate a Windows NT
Event Viewer Event ID 210 with a conversion error of 4097. The MTA will generate
a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) and return a messages with the error:

   Content-type unsupported.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by invalid encoding of a message by the foreign X.400 system. One
specific cause is the message lists an improper length of the IPN ID. This can
be detected by generating text event logging with logging level set to maximum
for the APDU and X400 Services. Parsing the message at fault and reviewing the
IPN ID will show that the length for the IPN ID field is invalid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
