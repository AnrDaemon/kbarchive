TITLE   :Error Creating Dependency for Quorum Resource
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to make a physical disk resource dependent on another resource,
and the physical disk resource is also the quorum device, you may observe the
following error message:

   Error 5069 - The cluster quorum resource is not allowed to have any
   dependencies.

CAUSE
=====

The quorum resource should not have any dependencies on any other resources.
However, it is acceptable for other resources to be dependent on the physical
disk resource that is also the quorum device. By definition, the quorum device
must be accessible to bring other resources online. Therefore, if the quorum
resource were to wait on any other resource to reach an online state, the
cluster service could not start.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the error message, do not attempt to make the quorum device dependent
upon any other resource. Also, keep this condition in mind when changing the
quorum disk designation to an existing physical disk resource, in case it has a
dependency on some other resource.
