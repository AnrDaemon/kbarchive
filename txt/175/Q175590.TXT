SYMPTOMS
========

CardBus cards may not work on computer with a Vesuvius chip set.

CAUSE
=====

The Vesuvius PCI IRQ miniport driver (Pcimp.pci) does not support the SetTrigger
and GetTrigger functions that report and set level-triggered interrupts. In
order for the CardBus bridge to be configured for a CardBus card's memory and
I/O windows, CardBus cards require level-triggered interrupts.

RESOLUTION
==========


To work around this problem, disable PCI Bus IRQ Steering in Device Manager. To
do so, follow these steps.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
   the System icon.

2. Click the Device Manager tab.

3. Double-click the System Devices branch to expand it.

4. Double-click PCI Bus, and then click the IRQ Steering tab.

5. Click the Use IRQ Settings check box to clear it, click OK, and then click
   OK.

6. Restart your computer.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
