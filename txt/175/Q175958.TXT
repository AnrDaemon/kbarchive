SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from a Microsoft Mail postoffice to a user on Microsoft
Exchange Server, the user on Microsoft Mail may receive a non-delivery report
(NDR). This is true, if the message from Microsoft Mail contains an attachment
with extended characters in the name, for example German characters like the "A"
with an umlaut. The NDR will look like this:

   [029] This mail message could not be parsed correctly.
   Mail item was not delivered to:
   NETWORK/PO/TEST
