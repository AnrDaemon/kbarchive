TITLE   :XADM: Unexpected Error 0xc0040000 Upgrading to Exchange 5.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0 SP2,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0 SP2, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you complete an installation of Exchange Server version 5.5 over a
previous version of Exchange Server, or upgrade Exchange Server version 5.0
Service Pack 1 to Service Pack 2, the following events will be logged in Event
Viewer and will appear to be a problem with the installation:

   Event ID: 1005
   Source: MSExchangeSA
   Type: Error
   Category: Monitoring

   Unexpected error <<0xc0040000 - The Microsoft Exchange Server computer
   is not available. Either there are network problems or the Microsoft
   Exchange Server computer is down for maintenance. Microsoft Exchange
   Server Information Store ED no.: 8004011d-0526-00000000>> occurred.

CAUSE
=====

Though the event appears to be a problem with the server, it is actually an
expected behavior. The Exchange system attendant is attempting to contact the
information store, which is not available at the specified time. After the
Exchange Setup program has completed, it begins restarting all the related
services. When you check further in the Event Viewer log, you will see a display
of the successful startup of the information store, as follows:

   Event ID: 1001
   Source: MSExchange IS Private
   Type: Error
   Category: Monitoring

   The Microsoft Exchange Information Store has started. Service startup
   complete, version 5.5.
