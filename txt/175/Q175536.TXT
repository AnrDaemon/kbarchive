SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Scholastic's Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean for the
Macintosh, version 1.0, you receive the following error message:

   The CD was ejected while it was in used.

NOTE: The word "used" is misspelled in the error message--it should be "use."

CAUSE
=====

 - The computer cannot read the compact disc.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure the System Folder and application folders are
not protected. If the folders are protected, remove the protection by following
these steps:

To remove the protection on the System Folder and applications folders, do the
following:

1. On the Apple Menu, point to or click Control Panels, and then click General
   Controls.

2. In the Folder Protection area, click the Protect System Folder and the
   Protect Applications Folders check boxes to clear them.

If the System Folder and application folders are not protected, use the following
steps to verify that your compact disc is readable and working correctly.

1. Clean the compact disc. Focus on fingerprints, smudges, and dust. These can
   often cause problems with reading the disc.
    - Gently wipe the silver side of the disc with a soft, lint-free cotton
      cloth. Do not use paper cloth, which may scratch the plastic or leave
      streaks.

    - Wipe from the center out. Do not use a circular motion.

2. Ensure you are using the Apple CD-ROM Extension by following these steps:
   a. On the Apple menu, point to or click Control Panels, and then click
      Extensions Manager.

   b. Make sure Apple CD-ROM is listed under Extensions.

3. If Apple CD-ROM is not listed, you will need to install it from your Apple
   Macintosh System Software compact disc.
