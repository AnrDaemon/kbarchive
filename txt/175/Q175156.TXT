KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose to view the Component dialog in Microsoft Visual Basic, either
by clicking on the Project menu and selecting Components or by using the
activation keys CTRL+T, the following error appears:

   Class not registered
   Looking for object with CLSID: {0002E005-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}

After clicking OK, the Component dialog opens and no components are displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Component Category Manager Library, ComCat.DLL, is incorrectly
registered.

RESOLUTION
==========

Correctly register ComCat.DLL using RegSvr32.Exe, a utility program that ships
with Visual Basic and allows you to register DLL's and other files into the
system registry.

To correctly register ComCat.DLL, follow the steps below:

1. Verify that ComCat.DLL is located in the Windows 95 or Windows 98
   Windows\System folder or in the Windows NT Windows\System32 folder. If
   ComCat.DLL can not be located, copy it from the Visual Basic installation
   media into the appropriate folder.

2. From the Start menu, choose Run.

3. Type the following command into the Run dialog, replacing <Path To
   Windows\System(32)> with the full path to your Windows\System folder:

   RegSvr32.Exe <Path To Windows\System(32)>\ComCat.DLL

MORE INFORMATION
================

OLE groups all components into functional categories called Component
Categories. ComCat.DLL is used to identify the areas of functionality that a
component may support and provides the functionality to register and unregister
components into specific Component Categories. Therefore, when Visual Basic
opens the Components dialog it can categorize the components into Controls,
Designers and Insertable Objects without displaying every object and class
registered on the system.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Unregister ComCat.DLL using RegSvr32.Exe:

   RegSvr32.Exe /U <Path To Windows\System(32)>\ComCat.DLL

2. Start Visual Basic, and create a new Standard EXE project.

3. From the Project menu, choose Components. The error message described above
   occurs. Note that when you click OK, no components are displayed.
