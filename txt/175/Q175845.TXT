TITLE   :XFOR: Attachment Icon Changes When Forwarding Msg to Notes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you forward a message with an attachment from an Outlook client to a Lotus
Notes client, the attachment icon may change to a default blank icon. The
attachment file name will be visible. When you open the attachment, the correct
application opens and displays the information.

CAUSE
=====

This is an existing functional limitation. The PR_ATTACH_RENDERING attribute is
not set on inbound messages into Exchange. Thus, the default icon is used when
the attachment is forwarded to Lotus Notes. Outlook and other Windows clients
can display the correct icon based on the file extension. No functionality is
lost, and corruption does not occur with the attachment when you view it in
Lotus Notes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
