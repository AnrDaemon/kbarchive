TITLE   :SMS: Windows 95 Clients Cannot Be Remotely Rebooted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some Windows 95 clients cannot be remotely restarted from Systems Management
Server through the Remote Reboot option. (This option is located in Personal
Computer Properties under the Help Desk.) Using the Remote Reboot option may
also cause the client computer to stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

The CPU reset instruction depends on the computer's hardware. This problem is
hardware-specific, and has been known to manifest itself on Gateway 2000 and HP
Vectra computers.

Note that the Remote Reboot function works correctly on client computers running
Windows NT, regardless of hardware.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
