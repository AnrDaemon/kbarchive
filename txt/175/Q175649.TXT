TITLE   :Adding New SCSI Controller to DEC Alpha May Prevent Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0

KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add a SCSI controller to an existing Microsoft Windows NT installation on
a Digital Alpha Personal Workstation 433, the BIOS may not find the operating
system boot partition.

This problem may also occur on other Alpha systems.

CAUSE
=====

In some cases it may be necessary to add additional SCSI controllers to an
existing system. Some of examples might be to add hardware for additional disk
storage or to prepare for installing Microsoft Cluster Server, for example,
which requires a separate SCSI bus for shared storage between cluster nodes.

Even though the boot device has not changed and the system BIOS indicates the
correct device path to the boot device, it does not have the correct SCSI
channel number stored for the path. This number is not displayed through the
bios configuration menus.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this condition, reselect the device path for the boot and operating
system partitions. This action will internally set the correct bus number for
the boot device, which may have changed. This problem may be avoided by
installing Windows NT with both controllers installed, rather than adding the
additional controller at a later date.
