TITLE   :XFOR: DirSync Cycle Removes Secondary X.400 Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A custom recipient's secondary X.400 addresses are removed after a successful
Directory Synchronization (DirSync) cycle.

CAUSE
=====

The user's Given Name, Surname, and/or Initials value within Microsoft Exchange
Server was changed by the DirSync process. This problem will generally only be
seen when mapping template information to the custom recipient's Given Name,
Surname, and/or Initials field within Microsoft Exchange.

The X.400 address for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks users participating in
DirSync within Microsoft Exchange is generated by the Microsoft Exchange
Directory Synchronization service (DXA). When the DXA receives a modification to
any of these values, it recognizes that it must generate a new X.400 address for
the custom recipient because an X.400 address includes this information.

The DXA was inadvertently removing all X.400 addresses, including secondary X.400
addresses, prior to creating the new address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. We are currently researching this problem in Microsoft Exchange
Server, version 4.0, and will post more information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
