TITLE   :XFOR: Systems Using Addresses with DDATYPE=MSXCX500, Will NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 will return non-delivery reports (NDRs)
to foreign mail systems that send messages to it with DDA TYPE/VALUE fields that
have a DDATYPE of MSXCX500.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0, will accept and deliver these messages.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by the way that Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0,
interoperates with systems that use proper x.500 Distinguished Names (DNs)
instead of the Microsoft Exchange DN format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0.


Microsoft recognizes the increasing need to support the Latin-5 character set
properly. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
