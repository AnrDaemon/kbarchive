The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to create a new mailbox or custom recipient in the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program, you may get the following error messages:

   E-mail addresses for address type "CCMAIL" were not generated because an
   error occurred. To view details of the error see the application event
   log in the Windows NT Event Viewer on the Microsoft Exchange Server
   computer.

   An error occurred while processing an e-mail address. To view details of
   the error, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer
   on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   ID no: c1030637

Also, the application log, viewed in the Windows NT Event Viewer, contains the
following entry:

   Event ID: 2034
   Source: MSExchangeSA
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description:
   Unable to generate an e-mail address. The 'CCMAIL - General Error (code
   1)'
   Address type was returned by address generation DLL
   'D:\exchsrvr\address\CCMAIL\i386\ccmproxy.dll'.

CAUSE
=====

The above problem occurred on a computer running Exchange Server 4.0. This
server is part of an Exchange Server site that also contains computers running
Exchange Server 5.0 in it. That is why the Lotus cc:Mail address was being
generated. Even though the above messages indicate problems generating the
cc:Mail address, the same errors could occur with any other proxy address type
(MS, X400, SMTP, and so on).

The above error messages are generated when the Gateway-Proxy attribute of the
Site Addressing object in the Configuration container has been modified, and a
proxy address type has been removed from the list of proxy address types.
Another way of modifying the Site addressing attribute is to perform it using
the Exchange Administrator program running in raw mode (/r).

The above errors were generated because even though the proxy address type has
been removed from the Site Addressing object, the actual proxy address generator
has not been removed from the E-mail Address Generators object in the
Configuration Addressing container.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the proxy address back to the Gateway-Proxy attribute of the Site Addressing
object.

If you do want to prevent the proxy address from being generated, both the proxy
address type and the proxy address generator must be removed.
