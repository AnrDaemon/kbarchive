TITLE   :SMS: Win 95 Clients Hang When Shut Down Using Remote Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a Remote Control session with a Windows 95 client computer, if the
administrator clicks Shut Down on the remote client's Start Menu, the client
computer may hang or experience a blue screen failure. When the administrator
presses CTRL+ALT+DEL, the client does not reboot and a physical reset of the
client computer is required.

Systems Management Server version 1.2 supports Remote Reboot through the HelpDesk
Reboot button, and does not support shutting down a client computer using the
Quick Windows viewer. Shutting down a Windows 95 client through Quick Windows
viewer may result in data loss on the Systems Management Server client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
