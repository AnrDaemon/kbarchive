TITLE   :XFOR: Greek Outlook Client Cannot Send Message to MS Mail User
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Greek Outlook Client to send a message to a Microsoft Mail user
through Microsoft Exchange, you may receive the following non-delivery report
(NDR):

   Delivery failed to MS:MICROSOFT/KESWICK/MARKCAT.
   Reason: 0 (transfer failed)
   diagnostic: -1 (no diagnostic).
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:KESWICK:MARKCAT01.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when using the Greek Outlook Client with a Greek version of
Exchange Server that has a Microsoft Mail Connector. When you send a message to
a Microsoft Mail user through the Exchange global address list, the user
receives the non-delivery report. This is caused by an error in the code page
translation for Greek characters going to the MS Mail postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
