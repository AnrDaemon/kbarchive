PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to extract the Windows NT account list using the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program, the Windows NT Domain drop down list box may not
contain an entry for the local computer's primary domain.

CAUSE
=====

A trusted domain has a domain name similar to the local domain, with the first
characters being identical.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
versions 4.0 and 5.0.

We are currently researching this problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
4.0 and will post more information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.


A supported fix for Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 is now available, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack
that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
