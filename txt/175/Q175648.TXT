SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Routing and Remote Access Service on a computer that previously
had RAS installed, you may receive the following message in Event Viewer:

   Event Id 20120 - "Could Not Open IPX SAP Socket for Exclusive Access".

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by an old Nwsap.dll being read instead of the updated RRAS
Ipxsap.dll.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To make sure there is not some conflict between Nwsap.dll and Ipxsap.dll, perform
the following steps:

1. Back up and delete Nwsap.dll from %windir%\system32.

2. Make sure that HKLM\SYS\CCS\Services\NwSapAgent\ImagePath is pointing to
   Mprouter.exe.

3. Make sure that Ipxsap.dll is present in the %windir%\system32 folder.
