TITLE   :XADM: Isinteg Ignores Lack of Space and Creates Empty Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run ISINTEG -<database> -dump -l <logfilename> to write the
results to a log, the file might be blank. If the drive hosting the log file is
full, Isinteg will not issue a warning, but the result will be an empty log
file.

If you use a floppy disk drive as the destination for the log file, insufficient
disk space will result in the following error message:

   Fatal Error: Unable to write to log file. Shutdown Initiated! Isinteg
   will shut down when ready.

This will be followed by a Dr. Watson error message indicating an access
violation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
