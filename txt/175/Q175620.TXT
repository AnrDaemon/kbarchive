The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Spellchk.app file cannot be distributed for use with developed applications
even if the machine already has the spell engine and dictionary installed from
another Microsoft product.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since many of their clients already have the spell engine and dictionary from a
version of Microsoft Office installed, developers often want to use the spelling
application (Spellchk.app) that ships with Visual FoxPro 3.0x and 5.0x with
their distributed applications. However, according to the license agreements,
this is not allowed.


As spelled out in the Common Speller Application Programming Interface (CSAPI)
License Agreement, the use of any of the spelling files shipping with any
Microsoft product is not allowed by external parties. This includes the use of
the spelling engine/dictionary on their hard drives if it was installed with a
Microsoft application. If an outside company is developing an application that
will offer spell functionality, they'll need to sign a separate license
agreement with INSO.

NOTE: INSO Corporation is the company from whom we license the spelling engine.
Here are their Internet Web site addresses and phone numbers:

 - 1-800-733-5799 (US only) and 1-617-573-6500
