The information in this article applies to:

 - Readings on Microsoft Windows and WOSA 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

"Readings on Microsoft Windows and WOSA" was originally designed to help prepare
the reader for two Microsoft Certified Professional exams, Exam 70- 150,
Microsoft Windows Operating Systems and Services Architecture I, and exam
70-151, Microsoft Windows Operating Systems and Services Architecture II.

Microsoft has phased out these two exams in favor of Exam 70-160, Microsoft
Windows Architecture I, and Exam 70-161, Microsoft Windows Architecture II.

Due to this change, Microsoft Press has created a replacement for the book
"Readings on Microsoft Windows and WOSA."
