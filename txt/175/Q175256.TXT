The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you anonymously log on to an Exchange Server computer via the Microsoft
Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, you may not be able to see one or more public
folders.

CAUSE
=====

Either the public folder has not been published on the Exchange Server computer,
or the anonymous account does not have a minimum of Folder Visible permissions
on the folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to perform the following
steps:

1. Open the HTTP (Web) Site Settings object from the site-level Protocols
   container.

2. Select the Folder Shortcuts tab. Using the New button, add any folders
   (except the root "All Public Folders" folder) you want to publish.

3. From the Properties dialog box of each published folder, select the General
   Tab.

4. On the General tab, select the Client Permissions button and make sure that
   the folder has at least the Folder Visible permission enabled for the
   anonymous account. To view the contents of the public folder, the anonymous
   account must have at least a role of Reviewer.
