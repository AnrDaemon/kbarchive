======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add a new server computer to a Windows NT domain, the
operation fails. Event ID 5770 appears in the event log:

   The session setup to the Windows NT Domain Controller <PDC_NAME> from
   computer <WORKSTATION> using account <MACHINENAME$> failed.
   <MACHINENAME> is declared to be a BDC in domain <DOMAIN2>. However,
   <MACHINENAME$> tried to connect as either a DC in a trusted domain, a
   member workstation in domain <DOMAIN2>, or as a server in domain
   <DOMAIN2>. Use the Server Manager to remove the BDC account for
   <MACHINENAME>.

CAUSE
=====

The name you are trying to use was previously in use by a LAN Manager domain
controller. The machine name MACHINENAME$ exists in the domain accounts
database, having been migrated from the LAN Manager accounts database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using User Manager for Domains, delete the MACHINENAME$ account from the domain
accounts database. Reset the machine account, if necessary, by deleting and
recreating it in Server Manager.

Additional query words: lanman lan manager error
