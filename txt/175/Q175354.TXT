TITLE   :XCON: Repeated Event IDs, 4284 & 4287, Indicate Network Problem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When mail is queued to go out through an X.400 connection, the following errors
may be logged repeatedly in the event log:

   Event ID: 4284
   Category: X.400 Service
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   An error has occurred during connection/disconnection. Error code=8511
   [POP4 POP4 DOWN 4 179] (14)

   ID 4287 Category X.400 Service
   An internal MTA error occurred.
   Contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
   Error code=8640 [POP4 POP4 DOWN4 18] (14)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The time interval "n," in seconds, between the logged errors is equal to the
number of seconds set in the X.400 Connector. To check this setting, open the
property pages of the X.400 Connector, select the Override tab, in the
Connection Retry Values frame, and read the Open Interval(sec) setting.

These errors may be caused by network problems, such as a WAN connection being
temporarily down. This does not necessarily indicate a problem with Exchange
Server or the Message Transfer Agent (MTA).

As mail is queued to go across the WAN link, the X.400 connector is attempting to
re-establish the connection every "n" seconds. Because the WAN connection is
down, the MTA transport is not available; the MTA is logging these two events.

Additional query words: x400 repeating
