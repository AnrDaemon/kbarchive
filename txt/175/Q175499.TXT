TITLE   :XCON: NDR When Replying to Another Exchange Organization
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you reply to a message sent from another Microsoft Exchange Organization or
from another Site within the same Organization, you may immediately receive the
following Non-Delivery Report (NDR) by the local Message Transfer Agent (MTA):

   Your message did not reach some or all the intended recipients.
   Subject:
   Sent: (Date/Time>
   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
   '' on date / time
   The recipient name is not recognized
   MSEXCH:MTA::

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the two Microsoft Exchange Organizations are connected
via the X.400 Connector, or when two Sites are connected via the X.400 Connector
with the Address Space Tab configured, and have the Allow MSExchange Contents
setting enabled.

When a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server sends a message to another
Exchange Server computer, the P1 for that message contains only the X500
Distinguished Name (DN) for the recipient's address. When the recipient replies
to the message, they reply to the DN of the message originator. However, in
seperate Exchange Organizations, as well as two Sites configured with the
Address Space Tab, this fails because the DN is only comprised of the
Organization and Site names.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, the administrator needs to go to the properties
page for the X.400 connector that connects the two Exchange Organizations or
Sites and do the following:

1. Click the Advanced tab.

2. Under X400 Link options, click to clear the Allow MSExchange Contents
   setting.

3. Restart the MTA Service.

Now when messages are sent to the other Exchange Organization or Site, a content
conversion occurs and the message P1 changes to a true X.400 O/R address that is
properly handled by the other Exchange Organization or Site.
