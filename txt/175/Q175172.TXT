The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.03 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook, it is not possible to use the
Recover Deleted Items option to restore deleted items from the Public Folders
folder, the Favorites folder, or any subfolders in the Favorites folder. These
folders are special folders and will never contain deleted items. This behavior
is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select any of the folders mentioned above, it is possible to access the
Recover Deleted Items option from the Tools menu. The list of recoverable items
that is subsequently shown will always be empty, because these folders will
never contain deleted items.
