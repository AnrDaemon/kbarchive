 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) Server, you receive the
following prompt:

   Enter the location of Windows NT 4.0

After you specify the appropriate location, Setup may not finish, and you may not
receive an error message.

CAUSE

This issue can occur when the location you specify is a shared network folder
instead of the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION

To resolve this issue, copy the Cdrom_w.40 file from the root folder of the
Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM to the shared network folder that contains the
Windows NT 4.0 installation files.

For information about how to copy a file, click Start, click Help, click the
Index tab, type "copying" (without quotation marks), double- click the "copying
