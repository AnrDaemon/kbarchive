TITLE   :MSN E-mail Notification Message Is Not Updated
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui kbmsn

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, a message is displayed notifying
you of how many new e-mail messages you have received. When you download your
new e-mail, the notification message remains on the screen but may still show
the same number of new e-mail messages.

CAUSE
=====

The e-mail notification message is updated at intervals of every three to five
minutes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To update the e-mail notification message immediately, load another MSN Web
page, such as the Essentials Home Page, and then click the Back button to return
to the previous page. This forces MSN to check for new e-mail and update the
e-mail notification message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can also occur if you have configured your MSN e-mail account to
leave a copy of your e-mail messages on the MSN mail server.

Additional query words: msnet msnetwork microsoft-net m.s.n.
