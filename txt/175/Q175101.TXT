TITLE   :XADM: Long Site and Organization Names Cause Setup Problems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Exchange Server version 5.5 and using a very long site
or organization name, errors may occur. If the name is longer than 64 characters
but fewer than 256, a dialog box will be displayed with the following message:

   Setup could not completely translate the organization and site display
   names into values suitable for generating e-mail addresses. Please enter
   the organization and site directory names.

A dialog box will be displayed that allows you to specify a directory name for
the organization and site. Valid input will only be a drive specification (that
is, C: or D:). Setup will resume from this point and use the previously
specified long site and organization names (abbreviated to 64 characters).

If the name you entered for the site or the organization is more than 256
characters, you will receive the following error message:

   An internal processing error has occurred: constraint violation. The
   value specified for an attribute is either too big, too small, or not
   valid.
   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID no: DS_E_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION

Setup will fail at this point. The only alternative is to restart the Setup
program and select a shorter name for the organization and site of the Exchange
Server computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server versions 5.0 and
5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. Additional query word:
