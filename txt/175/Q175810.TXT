TITLE   :XADM: Upgrade to Exchange Server 5.0 Takes a Long Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 to Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0, the setup program upgrades the Information Store databases to a new
format.

On average, the setup process usually takes thirty minutes to an hour to upgrade
1 GB of information. However, sometimes this can take longer. The setup program
displays no status messages, and normal disk activity occurs.

The upgrade process to Exchange Server 5.0 can be monitored by examining the
Application Event Log in the event viewer for the following event:

   Event ID: 1185
   Source: MSExchangeISPrivate
   Description:
   Successfully upgraded to database version X.XX.

NOTE: The final database version for Exchange Server 5.0 is version 2.35. If the
information store has been upgraded correctly then it will display the above
message for both the private information store and the public information store,
provided they both exist on the server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by product design.
