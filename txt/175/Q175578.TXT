TITLE   :XCON: Autoforwarded Messages Not Handled Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Exchange Server is connected to a Net-Tel Route400 MTA (1988
mode) via an X.400 connector, and an X.400 message is sent to a recipient on the
Net-Tel Message Transfer Agent (MTA) that autoforwards all messages to a
Microsoft Exchange mailbox, the intended recipient of the message may receive a
non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the following:

   From: Administrateur syst?me
   Sent: Thursday, April 17, 1997 9:09 AM
   To: Test user
   Subject: Non remis:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.
   Subject: Unknown
   Sent: Unknown
   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
   luc vieujean on 4/17/97 9:09:51 AM
   Une erreur de syntaxe a ?t? d?tect?e dans le contenu du message
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:EXCHGLUX:SNIFFY

CAUSE
=====

The Net-Tel MTA creates a new message containing the contents of the original
message, sets the originator to the address of the intended recipient of the
original message, and sets the recipient to the address of the Microsoft
Exchange mailbox that the original message is being forwarded to. Microsoft
Exchange Server does not handle these autoforwarded messages correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
