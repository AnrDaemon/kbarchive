TITLE   :XADAM: Cannot Edit the PAB Migration Message in Exchange 5.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate users from SFS or cc:Mail to Microsoft Exchange Server, you
cannot edit the PAB migration message that is paced in the migrated user's
Inbox. This functionality existed in Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

This change was implemented to simplify codepage issues resulting from editing
the default PAB message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this problem, follow these steps:

1. Create a text file called Pabmsg.txt and place it in the \Exchsrvr\bin
   directory.

2. Run all migrations that will generate the PAB migration message (SFS,
   CCMail).

When you no longer want this functionality, simply remove the Pabmsg.txt file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
