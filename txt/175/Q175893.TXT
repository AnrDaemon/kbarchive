PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOM

When you use LexMark TCP/IP print monitor with a computer running Windows
NT 4.0, you may experience very slow printing and Spoolss.exe seems to stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

The problem has been experienced using 80 LexMark computers to connect printers
to a Token Ring network.

A user-mode dump of Spoolss shows 85 spooler threads, of which 28 run in a tight
loop in LexMark print monitor. The threads looping in LexMark monitor wait for
20 minutes on an incoming printer message and compete for CPU cycles during this
time. This slows down the Spoolss process. The problem increases when adding
LexMark computers to the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a new LexMark print monitor (version 3.03) available on LexMark's Web
site. If you need help on setup of the new print monitor, call LexMark's
Technical Support Center.
