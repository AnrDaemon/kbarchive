SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 may generate an access
violation when manipulating a message.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows system can return a NULL pointer to a MENU ID that the client will
attempt to access. This circumstance is dependant on strict timing and requires
a number of events to occur in such an order that the MENU ID of the object
being accessed has since been released by Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Windows NT
client, version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem can be reproduced only on a random basis. The following is an
example of the commands used to reproduce the problem.

1. User1 sends a message with an Word attachment to User2.

2. User2 opens the message and opens the attachment in Word.

3. User2 closes the attachment.
