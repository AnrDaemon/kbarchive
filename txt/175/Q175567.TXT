TITLE   :XCLN: Upgrading to Outlook 8.03 Does not Remove Exchange Icons
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:8.03
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If Microsoft Exchange has been installed in a custom program group, (such as "My
Exchange Client"), instead of the default group called Microsoft Exchange and
you upgrade to Microsoft Outlook and choose the same program group where
Microsoft Exchange is installed, an empty program group called Microsoft
Exchange is created. Also, the old Microsoft Exchange icons are not removed from
the original program group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook for Windows
3.x, version 8.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some cases, this behavior may be desirable. Because the old Exchange icons
are not removed when the new Outlook icons are added to the old program group,
users can run either the old Exchange client or new Outlook client, or both.

If Microsoft Outlook client is installed in the same directory as the Exchange
client, it is assumed that Microsoft Exchange will no longer be used. Therefore,
the following icons can be manually deleted from the program group:

   Microsoft Exchange
   MS Exchange Services
   Inbox Repair Tool
   Microsoft Exchange Setup
   ShivaRemote Setup
   Microsoft Schedule+

The empty Microsoft Exchange program group that was created by the Microsoft
Outlook installation will also need to be deleted.
