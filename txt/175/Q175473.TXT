The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf 98. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can download the Bs96ingn.lst file from the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://bookshelf.msn.com/na/inetdir/updates.asp

Bookshelf 98 does not require the Internet Directory updates provided by the
Bs96ingn.lst file. To maintain updated Web links, Bookshelf 98 uses a redirector
on the Bookshelf Web site.

SUMMARY
=======

If you remove Microsoft Bookshelf 98 using the Remove All option, the Setup
program deletes the Bs96ingn.lst file from the Bookshelf 96 folder. This file
contains the updates to the Internet Directory 96 included with Microsoft
Bookshelf 1996-97.

Additional query words: multi multi-media media mm updates
