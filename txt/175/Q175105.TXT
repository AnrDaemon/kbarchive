KEYWORDS:kbusage

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

If you select a different but compatible character set for encoding an Internet
message, the result will be a message whose body is encoded using the selected
character set. However, the message body is still labeled with the default
Internet character set for that type of message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, a Western European message will typically use the ISO-8859-1
character set. If you select any other compatible character set for encoding
this message, such as Windows-1252, the resulting Internet message is labeled
with the ISO-8859-1 character set. The message is actually encoded with the
Windows-1252 character set.

It is recommended that only typical Internet character sets be used to encode
messages.

Additional query words: decode charset
