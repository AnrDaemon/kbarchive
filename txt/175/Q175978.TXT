======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Exchange Server and configure connections in the
Microsoft Mail Connector Connections tab, you may receive the following error:

   <network name> is a reserved network name. Enter a
   different name.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you enter a reserved name for the Microsoft Mail network
name. The following list contains the names that cannot be used as network
names:

     ATTMAIL            GTE           SMTP
     COMPUSERVE         MCI           SNADS
     DISOSS             MHS           SOURCE
     EASYLINK           MSMAIL        VMGATE
     ENVOY              OV            X400
     FAX                PROFS         *EMS

These are network names of some common gateways for Microsoft Mail, which is why
they are reserved. If the network name for any Microsoft Mail postoffice is in
this list, then you will not be able to connect to that postoffice when you use
the Microsoft Mail Connector.
