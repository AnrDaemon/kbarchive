PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows NT 4.0 Server with a DigiBoard version 2.1.0
installed may Blue Screen with the following error.

   Stop 0x0000007F(0x00000008, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)

NOTE: The first parameter will always be 0x0000008 (Double Fault)

CAUSE
=====

The driver has caused the thread's memory stack to overrun, causing the Stop
0x7f error. The driver for the DigiBoard version 2.1.0 is named Digifep5.sys,
located in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers directory.


RESOLUTION
==========

The driver should be updated with the Digifep5.sys that comes with Windows NT
4.0, or go to Digiboard's FTP site for the latest driver.
