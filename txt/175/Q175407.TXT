SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Age of Empires, the game may stop responding (hang) after
several minutes of game play in a multiplayer session on Zone.com.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use certain hardware configurations and your
Internet service provider (ISP) installs a third-party version of the
Winsock.dll file that is not compatible with Age of Empires.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Extract a new copy of the Winsock.dll file from your original Windows 95/98
   CD-ROM or disks to the Windows folder. For information about how to use the
   Extract tool, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:

   Q129605 How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files

2. If the issue continues to occur, change the value data for the CommandLine
   value in the following registry key to "lobby msync" (without the quotation
   marks):

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DirectPlay\Applications\ 
   Age of Empires

NOTE: You must separate "lobby" and "msync" with a blank space.
