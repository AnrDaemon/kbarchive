In Word 97, the WordBasic programming language was replaced with Visual Basic for
Applications. In WordBasic, you used the following code to select the current
paragraph:

      EditGoTo "\para"

To select the current paragraph using Visual Basic for Applications code, you can
use one of the following alternative methods.

Method 1: Using the GoTo Method
-------------------------------

You can use the GoTo method of the Selection object to select the current
paragraph, as in the following Visual Basic statement:

      Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="\para"

Method 2: Using the StartOf and MoveEnd Methods
-----------------------------------------------

You can use the StartOf and MoveEnd methods of the Selection object to select
from the beginning to the end of the paragraph, as in the following Visual Basic
statements:

      Selection.StartOf Unit:=wdParagraphm
      Selection.MoveEnd Unit:=wdParagraph

Method 3: Using the Select Method
---------------------------------

If you know the number of the paragraph you want to select, you can use the
following statement:

      Selection.Paragraphs(n).Range.Select

where n is the number of the paragraph you want to select. For example, the
following statement selects the third paragraph in the document:

      Selection.Paragraphs(3).Range.Select
