-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5 
 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, versions 2.5, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUG #: 17322 (6.50)

SYMPTOMS
========

Multiple threads, each allocating its own HSTMT using server cursors (active
statements) sharing a single connection, cause the following error on prepared
execution of a SQL statement:

   S1000: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver] Connection is busy with results
   for another hstmt

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use SQLExecDirect statements instead of SQLPrepare
and SQLExecute when using multiple active HSTMTs (on different threads) and
server cursors.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SQL Server version 6.5 and Open
Database Connectivity version 3.0. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: timing multi-threaded
