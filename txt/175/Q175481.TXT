The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server

SUMMARY
=======

When users are moved from one server in a site to another server in the same
site, multiple copies of the same message are not moved to the destination
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 and Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server store mail by a
method that is known as single instance storage. If a message is sent to one
recipient and is copied to 20 other recipients, Exchange Server 5.5 and Exchange
2000 maintain only one copy of the message in its database. It then has
pointers, which point to the original recipient as well as to the 20 other
recipients. If the original recipient and the 20 other recipients are moved to
another server in the site with the Move Mailbox utility located on Tools menu
of the Exchange Administrator program, only one copy of the message is
maintained on the new server.

During a move of users, Exchange Server 5.5 and Exchange 2000 checks every
incoming message against its own internally assigned IDs. These internal IDs are
not viewable with a client. If Exchange Server 5.5 or Exchange 2000 determines
that the incoming message is a duplicate, it merely sets up a pointer for that
existing message pointing to the newly moved user.
