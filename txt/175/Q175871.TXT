SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade Windows NT 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0, and File and Print Services
for NetWare (FPNW) for Windows NT 4.0, you are able to view only 2 GB of data
when issuing a directory command from a DOS or NetWare client. You, however, are
able to see the entire 20 GB volume of data on his or her NetWare server from
the same DOS or NetWare client.

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. and
Microsoft Services for NetWare 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
