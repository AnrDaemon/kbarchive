SUMMARY
=======

The Dial control is a circular slider control similar to a volume knob found on
a stereo system. This control can be used in a situation where you want the
functionality of a regular slider control but lack the space. If the Limit
property is set to true, the Dial control operates as a normal slider control.
The Value can be increased and decreased between the limits defined by Min and
Max properties.

With the Limit property set to False, the Dial can be used to make adjustments to
large numbers. For example, use the Dial to adjust the margin of a control. Each
revolution of the dial increases or decreases the value by (Min - Max). This
could allow for "fine tuning" of the number, while allowing for rapid
variations.

The sample project is available from the Visual Basic Owner's site at
http://premium.microsoft.com/download/vbasic/dial.exe. Only registered users of
Visual Basic can access this site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Dial control has two modes: limited and non-limited. In limited mode, the
minimum and maximum values determine the limits possible within one revolution.
The dial can be turned only one revolution.

In the non-limited mode, the minimum and maximum values set the range of the dial
in one revolution. However, the dial can be turned unlimited revolutions. So,
the limited mode could be used to adjust a value between two extremes, such as 1
and 100. The non-limited mode could be used to determine how much adjustment is
possible in the margins of a page. Each revolution could equal one inch.
