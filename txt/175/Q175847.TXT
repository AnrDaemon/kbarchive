SUMMARY
=======

There are specific instructions included with the Microsoft Windows NT Resource
Kit to set up data logging on a remote computer. The instructions in this
article are an update from the instructions included with the Windows NT
Resource Kit. It is important that you follow these instructions and use the
appropriate folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up data logging on a remote computer, perform the following steps:

1. Create a settings file by using the Windows NT Performance Monitor
   (Perfmon.exe) on the local computer.

    - Specify all objects you want to log and the alerts you want.

    - Specify the log file name (*.LOG) and the logging interval by saving the
      file to a local folder (this folder must also exist on the target system),
      using the Log command on the Options menu. Do not start logging. (This
      simply determines the name of the log file. The log file will be created
      on the target computer when the monitor service is stopped).

    - Save the settings file (*.PMW) into the target computer's
      %SystemRoot%\System32 folder by using the Save Workspace command on the
      File menu.

2. Copy Datalog.exe into both the target and local computers'
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

3. Ensure that there is a c:\Users\Default folder on the target computer.

   NOTE: The target computer is the computer that you are monitoring; the source
   is the computer that you are working from. The final log will be located on
   the target computer.

4. To install the Data Logging Service, type the following command at a command
   prompt window in the target %SystemRoot%\System32 folder:

   monitor \\computername setup

   This command registers the service with the Service Manager. You only need to
   run this command once for each computer. You must have the appropriate rights
   to start a service on the target computer.

5. To use your settings file, type:

   monitor \\computername filename

   NOTE: It is important to put the entire path for the file name.

   For example: %SystemRoot%\System32\Filename.pmw

6. To start logging events and alerts, immediately type the following command:

   monitor \\computername start

7. To stop logging, type the following command:

   monitor \\computername stop

8. To view the log file in Performance Monitor, the log file will be located in
   the target computer's %SystemRoot%\Users\Default folder.

   NOTE: You must stop the Monitor service before you can use the log file in
   Performance Monitor.
