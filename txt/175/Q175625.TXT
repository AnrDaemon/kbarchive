SUMMARY
=======

One of the sample project files for this article provides an example of a way to
close a Top-Level form and have the user prompted to close each child form.
Another sample project file shows a way to try to do this that does not work.
Still another sample project file shows a way to accomplish the task that almost
works or will work in limited circumstances. The following files are available
for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   Topclose.exe

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, forms can be set to show as Top-Level forms. Other child
forms can be opened in the Top-Level form. This article will discuss a way to
close the Top-Level form and have the user prompted for saving changes to any
child forms contained in the Top-Level form. The solution presented will work
the best in Visual FoxPro 5.0a and only partially in Visual FoxPro 5.0 or later
due to changes in how the QueryUnload method is called.

Note that the solution presented here is not necessarily the only way to handle
this situation. More sophisticated schemes can be developed. In fact, this
article does not consider the case of Windows being exited with the application
running.

Also note that the scenario presented here is fairly complex. Microsoft Product
Support Engineers will not know all the issues presented in this article without
spending some time working with the sample files. Please remember this if asking
questions on the enclosed files.

Additional Information

that follows:

The TopClose.exe should extract into three folders, TopClose\Almost, TopClose\Bad
and TopClose\Good.

   it was made.

 - Almost.scx

 - Almost.sct - The form files for the main Top-Level form.

 - Almost.mnx

 - Almost.mnt - The menu that is placed in the Top-Level form, Almost.scx.

 - Almost.prg - The main program in the project.

 - AlmostBlue.scx

 - AlmostBlue.sct

 - AlmostGreen.scx

 - AlmostGreen.sct

 - AlmostRed.scx

 - AlmostRed.sct - The form files for the child forms of the Top-Level form.

Contents of TopClose\Bad:

 - Bad.app

 - Bad.pjx

 - GoodBlue.sct

 - GoodGreen.scx

 - GoodGreen.sct

 - GoodRed.scx

 - GoodRed.sct - The form files for the child forms of the Top-Level form.

To use the sample files, follow these instructions:

1. Set the Visual FoxPro working folder to either TopClose\Bad TopClose\Almost
   or TopClose\Good. Use the File Locations tab of the Tools menu, Options
   dialog box or use the SET DEFAULT TO command in the Command window. For
   example, if the TopClose folder is on the C:\ drive:

   SET DEFAULT TO c:\TopClose\Bad

2. If the default folder is set to TopClose\Bad, DO Bad.app. If the default
   folder is set to TopClose\Good, DO Good.app or Almost.app if the default is
   TopClose\Almost.

3. The forms in each application can be run as many times as desired. For
   instance, two or three copies of the GoodRed form can be run. When a form is
   run more than once, it will come up in the same place so be sure to move a
   form after running it once if it is going to be run again. Otherwise, it
   won't be obvious that it is there more than once.

4. If the process of running the Almost application, rebuilding it and running
   it again is repeated a few times, this may cause Visual FoxPro to
   unexpectedly quit. This is currently under investigation. The application
   termination seems to always happen during the building of the application and
   should not effect the running application. Another problem that may occur is
   that a "phantom" copy of the Top-Level form may also be noticed on the
   Windows Taskbar for each time the application is run in the development
   environment. Although this appears as a problem in the Visual FoxPro
   development environment, no problems have been observed if the project is
   built into an executable file and it is run as a stand-alone executable and
   the Top-Level form is the main form in the executable's interface. If the
   Top-Level form is only one part of an executable, the method of closing the
   child forms illustrated in Good.app should be used. The executable also has
   problems if run under the development environment. That is why this version
   of the application is named "almost." It almost works.

   Q175682 PRB: VFP Crashes When Working With Top-Level and Child Forms

Discussion Of Sample Files' Behavior
------------------------------------

Normally the QueryUnload method can be used in a form to determine if a form is
ready to be closed. The Online Help for Visual FoxPro states that it "...occurs
when CLEAR WINDOWS, RELEASE WINDOWS, or QUIT is executed in code, when the user
double-clicks the Control-menu box, or when the user chooses Close from the
Control-menu on a form." If the form is contained in a Top-Level form and the
Top-Level form is closed as described above, the QueryUnload method of any child
forms does not behave as expected.

In Visual FoxPro 5.0 or later, the QueryUnload method of child forms is executed
before the QueryUnload of the Top-Level parent form. This is reversed in Visual
FoxPro 5.0a. Here the QueryUnload of the Top-Level parent form is executed
before the child forms' QueryUnload. Therefore the main difference between how
the two versions behave is that Visual FoxPro 5.0a will ask if the Top-Level
form is ready to be closed while Visual FoxPro 5.0 will not. This is because the
code that asks this question is in the QueryUnload method of the Top-Level form
that is not executed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 or later.

In either case, if the child forms are not closed or NODEFAULT is not encountered
in the QueryUnload of the Top-Level form, the user is essentially stuck in an
endless loop getting asked if it is OK to close each child form. This will only
stop if there is only one child form left. Run the Bad.app to see this
illustrated. There are instructions on the main Top-Level form for what to do to
illustrate the problem.

What seems to be the best way to handle this situation is to put code in the
QueryUnload methods of both the Top-Level form and the child forms. If the
QueryUnload method in the Almost.scx form is reviewed, it would appear that this
should be all that is necessary to close the child forms. Unfortunately, due to
what appears to be a bug in Visual FoxPro, this technique cannot be used in all
circumstances. Only if the Top-Level form is the main and only interface for a
distributed executable file does this technique seem not to cause problems.

Whether using the technique in the Good.app or the Almost.app(not really
recommended), additional code can be placed in the QueryUnload methods of the
child forms in case they are closed by their control boxes. Below is the
QueryUnload method code from the Top-Level form and one of the child forms in
the Good.app example. Also review the code in the actual form's methods and the
other files in the project:

   *** QueryUnload of Good Top-Level form

      LOCAL lAllClosed, lFormOpen
      lAllClosed=.T.
      lFormOpen=.F.
      LOCAL xx
      xx=_Screen.FormCount

      * The CloseBox or Close command in the application menu was chosen
      IF This.ReleaseType=1
         IF MESSAGEBOX(;
            "Are you ready to close this top-level form?",36,;
            "QueryUnload of "+THIS.Caption) = 7
            NODEFAULT
            lAllClosed=.F.
            RETURN lAllClosed
         ENDIF
      ENDIF

      * The Quit menu option was chosen
      IF This.ReleaseType=0 AND xx>1

         IF MESSAGEBOX(;
            "Are you ready to close this top-level form?",36,;
            "QueryUnload of "+THIS.Caption) = 7
            NODEFAULT
            lAllClosed=.F.
            RETURN lAllClosed
         ENDIF
      ENDIF

      * Attempt to close all active forms via each form's QueryUnload event
         DO WHILE TYPE('_SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM') = "O" AND ;
                     _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.NAME <> "_"
               IF NOT _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.QUERYUNLOAD()
                     lAllClosed = .F.
                     NODEFAULT
                     EXIT
               ENDIF
            ENDDO
      RETURN lAllClosed
      *** End of QueryUnload of Good Top-Level form **********************

      *** QueryUnload of a Child form - either the GoodRed or GoodGreen.scx

      LOCAL x,xx,ans,cTopLevelCaption
      * Getting the caption of the Top-Level form to use in dialog boxes
      xx = _SCREEN.FormCount
      FOR x = 1 TO xx
         IF _SCREEN.FORMS[x].NAME = "_"
            cTopLevelCaption = _SCREEN.FORMS[x].Caption
            EXIT
         ENDIF
      ENDFOR
      ******

      * Optionally save changes before closing the form
      ans = MESSAGEBOX(;

            "Do you want to save changes to the "+CHR(13)+;
            THIS.Caption+"?",35,cTopLevelCaption)
      DO CASE
         CASE ans = 6   && Yes
            WAIT WINDOW "Changes saved" TIMEOUT 1
         CASE ans = 7   && No
            WAIT WINDOW "Changes NOT saved" TIMEOUT 1
         CASE ans = 2   && Cancel
            * Abort closing this form
            NODEFAULT
            * Return to calling program
            RETURN .F.
      ENDCASE
      THIS.RELEASE && if QueryUnload called as a method

Run the Good.app in Visual FoxPro 5.0a to see the code above in action. In the
Good.app example, Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 5.0a behave the same way if the Quit
menu option is chosen. Quit calls the QueryUnload method of the Top-Level form
and if that returns true(.T.) then the Top-Level form is released and CLEAR
EVENTS is issued. Note that the Destroy method of the Top-Level form issues a
CLEAR EVENTS.

There is a difference between Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 5.0a if the CloseBox is used
to close the Top-Level form when the child forms are open. In Visual FoxPro 5.0,
the GoodRed and GoodGreen forms are closed since they don't have anything in
their QueryUnload methods to prevent that. The GoodBlue form has code in its
QueryUnload method that can be used to keep the form from closing. But if two
instances of the GoodBlue form are running, answering "No" when prompted to
close will put Visual FoxPro into the same endless loop illustrated in Bad.app.
This happens with both the Almost.app and Good.app in Visual FoxPro 5.0 or
later. This does not happen in Visual FoxPro 5.0a with either application.
