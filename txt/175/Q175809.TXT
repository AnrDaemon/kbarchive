SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Rsh.exe utility to remotely execute commands on a UNIX server,
you are prompted for a password for authentication.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To work around this issue, you can prevent the remote shell (Rsh.exe) utility
from prompting for a password by configuring the Hosts.equiv file on the UNIX
server with the IP address and host name of the computer from which you are
running Rsh.exe.

See Hosts.equiv help on the UNIX host for more information.
