PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Exchange Server on a cluster server and then try to
configure the AppleTalk portion of the Microsoft Mail Connector interchange
service, Chooser does not recognize the Exchange cluster name. It can only see
the Windows NT machine names.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The AppleTalk MTA (ATMTA) is not supported in this
configuration.

Additional query words: macintosh
