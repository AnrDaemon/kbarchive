PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Replicator Service of a directory replication import computer posts the
following Event 3206 error.

   Event ID: 3206
   Source: Replicator
   Type: error
   Description: The replicator can not update directory
   C:\Winnt\System32\Repl\Import (or (C:\Winnt\System32\Repl\Import
   \Scripts)(by default). It has tree integrity and is the current
   directory for some processes.

You may also encounter No Sync errors in the Directory Replication Properties
dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

Possible causes include:

 - The NETLOGON share is accessed/connected by a user or process at the times
   when replication tries to run.

 - The import folder is in use by another process at the times the errors are
   occurring.

 - The import directory is locked.

 - This message also gets generated when the Wait Until Stabilized check box is
   selected in the Replicator service, and a process, such as Windows NT
   Explorer is opening and viewing that directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the NETLOGON share and the REPL$ share to ensure no one, except the
Replicator Service Account has a connection to the share.

From the Control Panel Server tool, click In Use to check any invalid connections
to the NETLOGON Share and REPL$ share. Or from Server Manager for Domains,
select the import server and the click In Use to check any invalid connections
to either share.

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, then
   double-click the Server icon.

2. Click In Use to check any invalid connections to the NETLOGON share and REPL$
   share.

   -or-

1. From Server Manager for Domains, select the Import Server and then click In
   Use to check any invalid connections to either share.

2. Check the lock status by clicking Manage under Import Directories in the
   Directory Replication dialog box. Remove Lock if a lock is posted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Directory Replicator service requires exclusive use of resources, such as
directories and all of their subdirectories being imported or exported, and
files on the REPL$ and NETLOGON shares. Any violation of this exclusive use,
such as File Manager having one of these directories open, or users connected to
the NETLOGON share, can cause this problem, plus they can cause Event ID 3216
and Event ID 3208 to occur.

For more information on Event ID 3216 and Event ID 3208, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

ARTICLE-ID: Q132950
TITLE : Event ID 3216 and 3208 Logged For Replicator Service

You should NOT use File Manager or Windows NT Explorer to examine the permissions
on the %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import directory, or else the special
permissions initially set there will be lost. These initial permissions enable
directory replication to work.

For more information on the default permissions to the directory trees, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
