SUMMARY
=======

If you are dual booting with Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0, you can save hard
drive space by allowing Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0 to share a Pagefile.sys
file on a common FAT partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the Pagifile.sys file in Windows NT, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the Systems icon. Click the Performance tab, and in the Virtual
   Memory section, click Change.

2. Set Initial Size: (MB) and Maximum Size: (MB) to the same value. Then click
   OK.

To configure the Pagefile.sys file in Windows 95/98, perform the following
steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   Double-click theSystem icon.

2. Click the Performance tab, and then click Virtual Memory.

3. Select the 'Let me specify my own virtual memory settings' option and set the
   Minimum and Maximum values to the same values entered for Windows NT above.

After you restart Windows 95/98, edit the System.ini file and add or edit the
following under:

   [386Enh]
   PagingFile=X:\PAGEFILE.SYS
   PagingDrive=X:

X: = the common drive

After these values are added or edited, restart the computer. If there is a
Win386.swp file remaining on the Windows 95/98 drive, the file can be deleted.
Both Windows 95/98 and Windows NT will now share the virtual memory space, thus
saving needed drive space.
