When running the Microsoft Exchange Server Utility GWReset, you may receive a
Dr. Watson error stating the following:

   An application error has occurred
   and an application error log is being generated.
   Reset.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc00000005), Address: 0x0040124f

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above error can occur if any of the following are true:

1. When starting Reset.exe, you already have a MAPI client started and logged on
   using a different profile than that of the Internet Mail Service gateway
   profile necessary for Reset.exe to run.

2. When choosing the profile for Reset.exe to use, you choose the incorrect
   profile.

3. When at the Choose Profile dialog box, you accidentally click Cancel.

Make sure that you do not have a MAPI profile already active before running
Reset.exe. Also, be sure to choose the correct MAPI profile created specifically
for access to the Internet Mail Service mailbox.
