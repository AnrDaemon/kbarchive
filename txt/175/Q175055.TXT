TITLE   :Cannot Use IPX/SPX with NetBIOS Support with Dial-Up Networking
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::1,2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool osr1 osr2 win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows 95 is configured to use the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol with
NetBIOS support enabled to communicate over a Dial-Up Networking connection, you
may receive an error message indicating that the NetBIOS name is already in use
if you use a program that uses NetBIOS over IPX/SPX. A Dial-Up Networking
connection that uses a different protocol (such as TCP/IP or NetBEUI) may work
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the Dial-Up Networking point-to-point (PPP) server is
configured to forward Type 20 IPX packets.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix for Windows 95 and OEM Service Release 2 that corrects this
problem is now available from Microsoft, but has not been fully regression
tested and should be applied only to computers experiencing this specific
problem. To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Technical upport
to obtain the fix.

on support costs, please go to the following address on the World Wide Web:

This fix for Windows 95 and OEM Service Release 2 should have the following file
attributes (or later):

   File name     Version    Date      Time     Size
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   Nwnblink.vxd  4.00.952   9/4/96    9:52am   46,677 bytes


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95, OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2), and Windows 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the PPP server forwards Type 20 (NetBIOS) IPX packets, it returns the
client's NetBIOS AddName packet back to the client who sent it. The Windows 95
IPX NetBIOS protocol (NWNBLink) does not recognize the packet as having
originated from itself, and interprets the response as indicating that the name
is already is use.
