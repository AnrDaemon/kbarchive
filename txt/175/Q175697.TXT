 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 with Microsoft Outlook Web
Access, a problem can occur when you try to view the next message, following a
move message operation.

If an open message is moved to another folder and the Read Next Item option is
selected, Outlook Web Access will skip the next message and move to the third
message in the folder. If there is no third message, the following error message
occurs:

   There are no more messages in that direction.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
