TITLE   :Server Service Fails with System Error 8 or System Error 234
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The server service fails to start and the following events are recorded:

   Event ID: 7023

      Source: Service Control Manager
      Type: Error
      Description: The Server service terminated with the following error:
                   More data is available.

-or-

   Not enough storage is available to process this command.

   Event ID: 7001

      Source: Service Control Manager
      Type: Error
      Description: The Net Logon service depends on the Server service
                   which failed to start because of the following error:
                   More data is available.

If you attempt to start the server service manually, the following errors may be
displayed:

   A system error has occurred.

   System error 234 has occurred.
   More data is available.

-or-

   System error 8 has occurred.
   Not enough storage is available to process this command.

Other services that may fail to start (also with event ID 7001) include the
computer browser and the directory replicator, because these services are
dependent on the Server service.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of these errors is the result of too much data stored in the following
key in the registry.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer
\Parameters\NullSessionPipes

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

The Server service queries the registry value above for its entries. The buffer
for the amount of information that the Server service can accept when it queries
is approximately 32 KB. If there are more than 32 KB in that entry, the Server
service will fail to start and return the error "More data is available," or
"Not enough storage is available."

RESOLUTION
==========

The solution is to remove any unnecessary entries from this value in the
registry, or apply (or reapply) the latest Windows NT Service pack.
