TITLE   :XFOR: IMS Failing to Decode Uuencoded Attachments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

UUEncoded body parts within a message received via the Microsoft Exchange Server
Internet Mail Service (IMS) are not decoded into an attachment. Instead, they
are left as UUEncoded text within the message.

CAUSE
=====

If a message includes a valid MIME header stating that the contents should be
text, then the above behavior is by design. However some messages will contain
partial MIME headers with UUEncoded bodyparts. In the case of a CONTENT-TYPE
header being present (without a full MIME version header), the Microsoft
Exchange Server will assume the message to be MIME and will not decode the
UUEncoded body parts. The information in the rest of this article describes how
this behavior can be modified so only valid MIME messages are treated this way.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

A new registry key value has been created for the Information Store to control
this behavior.

1. Start Windows NT Registry Editor. Use Regedt32.exe if you are running Windows
   NT 3.51 and either Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe for Windows NT 4.0.

2. Create the following registry value:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ 
   ParametersSystem\InternetContent

   Value Name: ContentTypeEQMimeVer
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 0 or 1 (default is 1)

3. Exit Registry Editor. Stop and restart the Microsoft Exchange Information
   Store for the change to take effect.

Setting this value to "1" means that if a top-level "Content-Type" header is
found in an inbound Internet Message, the message is treated as a MIME message
even if a "MIME Version" header is missing. Setting this value to "0" means that
an Internet message is treated as a MIME message ONLY if a "MIME Version" header
is found.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
