TITLE   :XFOR: Thai Characters not Translated by the MS Mail Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Mail messages containing Thai characters sent between a Microsoft Exchange
client on a Microsoft Exchange Server and a Microsoft Mail client on a Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks Postoffice are not translated correctly. These symptoms
occur when the message is sent via the Microsoft Mail Connector.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Microsoft Mail Connector requires a Primary Language for
clients, to allow correct conversion for a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
Postoffice. The Primary Language is set from the Interchange panel when viewing
the properties page of the Microsoft Mail Connector in the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program. Thai is not a valid option to set for this conversion, so
the correct conversion does not happen. The fix indicated below will allow the
Primary Language to be set to Thai.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because different Microsoft Mail for PC Networks client versions require a
different conversion, there is more than one fix required to add this
functionality. The Windows for Workgroups (Thai) client, Microsoft Mail 3.5
(USA), and Microsoft Mail 3.2 (USA) client are the three clients tested that
exhibit this incorrect behavior.
