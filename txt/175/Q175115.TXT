SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program in batch mode using:

   Setup /q [batchfile]

the following error may be displayed:

   There is something wrong with the INI file. Make sure the command line
   specifies a full path to a valid INI file.

This error occurs when the batch file contains PerServer licensing information.
Licensing mode was changed to only allow PerSeat mode for Exchange Server. To
correct this problem, edit the batch file and change the licensing mode to be
PerSeat and remove the PerServer information.
