TITLE   :XWEB: Outlook Web Access Attachments are Received Empty
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Multiple attachments in Outlook Web Access are received as a single blank or
empty attachment or not received at all.

CAUSE
=====

The sender attempting to send multiple attachments and delimiting the
attachments with a semi-colon. For example, after clicking the Attachment tab to
choose the attachments to send, the user types in multiple filenames such as
<file1;file2>. This causes the Outlook Web Access client to search for a
file named <file1;file2> for the attachment. Because Outlook Web Access
cannot find that filename, it sends a single blank or empty attachment.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Browse feature to select multiple attachments. These items must be
selected individually and added as attachments.

NOTE: Netscape Navigator 4.02 and previous versions only support single
attachments. If multiple attachments are selected and sent, the attachments are
received as an icon, but with nothing in them.
