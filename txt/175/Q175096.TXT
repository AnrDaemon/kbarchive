TITLE   :XCLN: Electronic Forms Designer Installation Hangs on Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing the Electronic Forms Designer (EFD) program from the
Microsoft Exchange Client or Outlook 97 CD-ROM onto an Exchange Server 5.5
computer, the Setup program will start, proceed through the first few screens,
and after prompting you for a user name and company, hang (stop responding).

CAUSE
=====

Other MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) services on the server
are causing the installation process to stall, because MAPI files in use cannot
be overwritten.

WORKAROUND
==========

Bring up Task Manager and stop Events.exe. This allows the installation process
to continue and complete successfully. To ensure that no other problems are
encountered, it is recommended that you stop all Exchange services until the
installation process is completed. After installation, restart the services
through the Services icon in Control Panel. EFD should function normally.
