TITLE   :Win32k.sys Causes STOP 0x0000001e and 0x0000000a on SMP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Programs runing on multiprocessor computers that start and close GUIs frequently
may cause either of the following STOP blue screen error messages to be
displayed:

   STOP 0x0000001e (0xc0000005, 0xa00f7538, 0x00000000, 0x00000008)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED


-or-

   STOP 0x0000000a(0x00000004, 0x0000001c, 0x00000000, 0x801175db)
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL


On some multiprocessor computers, programs with multiple threads that use the
CreateProcess() or CreateProcessAsUser() API calls to start processes do not
start because of desktop heap leaks. This inability to start results in a
User32.dll or Kernel32.dll file initialization error when the desktop heap is
exhausted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the thread object reference count breaks. The thread
object reference count breaks because of a threadlockobject instruction within
Win32k.sys that was not multiprocessor safe. This causes programs to quit
abnormally. Because of the abnormal way in which the program quits, the desktop
heap leaked until new processes could not be started. In some other instances,
when a program quits abnormally, a blue screen error message may be displayed.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
