TITLE   :Multipage LU3 Print Jobs Don't Form Feed Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), Form Feeds between pages of
a multipage LU3 host print job may not be honored. When this problem occurs, the
beginning of a page is printed at the end of the previous page. This also occurs
when the host sends multiple one-page LU3 print jobs in succession.

The same LU3 host print job printed correctly before you applied SP2.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the LU3 print job contains the following sequence at the
end of a page of data

   0C 0D 19      *or*      0C 19

where

   0C = form feed (FF)
   0D = carriage return (CR)
   19 = end of medium/end of message (EM)

The 3270 print provider for the host print service is not correctly handling
sequences that contained an FF followed by an EM for multipage LU3 host print
jobs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 3.0
Service Pack 2 (SP2).

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

With the fix applied, the 3270 print provider correctly handles multipage LU3
host print jobs that include FFs followed by an EM control code. The updated
module is <snaroot>\system\ppd3270.dll.

MORE INFORMATION
