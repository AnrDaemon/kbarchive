SYMPTOMS

When you clear the Documents menu, the most recently used list (MRU, or the list
of files most recently accessed) from the Find tool and Internet Explorer may
also be cleared.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, manually delete the contents of the Recent folder
instead of clicking Clear on the Start Menu Programs tab in Taskbar properties.
To manually delete the contents of the Recent folder, use the appropriate
method:

Windows 95

1. Double-click My Computer, and then click Options (or Folder Options) on the
   View menu.

2. On the View tab, click Show All Files, click OK, and then close My Computer.

3. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

4. In the Named box, type "recent" (without the quotation marks), and then click
   Find Now.

5. Double-click the Recent folder located in the Windows folder (or in the
   Windows\Profiles\<username> folder), and then click Select All on the
   Edit menu.

6. On the File menu, click Delete, click Yes if you are prompted to confirm that
   you want to delete the files, and then close the Find tool.

   you want to delete the files, and then close the Find tool.
