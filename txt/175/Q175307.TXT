KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the
"Restoring a Registry Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Srvinfo.exe from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit, it results in the
following error message:

   Dr. Watson For Windows NT

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   SRVINFO.exe Exception access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x77a5510

The Application Event Log records the following:

   Event Id: 4097
   Source: DrWatson

   The application, exe\srvinfo.dbg, generated an application error. The
   error occurred on <date> @  <time>. The exception generated was
   c0000005 at address 77a05510 (wcscpy).

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when a self-extracting hotfix has been applied to the server prior
to running Srvinfo.exe.

RESOLUTION
==========

Editing the registry to remove the key created when running the hotfix will
allow Srvinfo.exe to run without error.

The scenario below uses the example of having run Oobfix_i.exe. Other self-
extracting hotfixes for various products will also produce this problem, however
the hotfix key may be located elsewhere in the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT
   \CurrentVersion\Hotfix

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Select the File 1 key. From the Registry menu, click Save Key. After the key
   is saved to disk, return to Registry Editor and delete the File 1 key.

Deleting this key will allow Svrinfo.exe to run without error, while still
displaying the hotfix information.

STATUS
======
