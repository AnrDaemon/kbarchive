KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbfile kbnetwork kbprint win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, you may be unable to
view the contents of NetWare print queues, and in the Printers folder, the
NetWare printers may appear to be off-line.

Note that this does not occur you are using the Microsoft Service for NetWare
Directory Services (MSNDS).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you are attached to multiple NetWare servers whose
names are almost identical. This can occur when the name of one NetWare server
to which you are attached is a subset of another NetWare server to which you are
attached. For example:

   Server 1:  MY_SERVER
   Server 2:  MY_SERVER_TOO

In this example, you may be unable to view print queues on MY_SERVER_TOO while
attached to MY_SERVER.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
Services (MSNDS). With MSNDS you can connect to both NetWare 4.x (NDS) servers
and NetWare 3.x (Bindery) servers.

For additional information on MSNDS, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q138709 Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services Available

   Q164558 Configuring MSNDS to Log in to a NetWare Bindery Server

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
