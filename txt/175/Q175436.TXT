TITLE   :DNS Stops Forwarding Queries After PPP Link Goes Down
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your Microsoft Windows NT Domain Name Service (DNS) server is configured to
forward requests to a DNS server across a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) link and
that link goes down, your DNS clients on your local area network (LAN) may
receive an error message similar to the following when they attempt to resolve
host names:

   Bad IP address

NOTE: Your clients will still receive this error even after the PPP link is
re-established.

CAUSE
=====

When the PPP link goes down, your Microsoft DNS server cannot automatically
rebind to the Remote Access Service (RAS) IP address.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, any time your PPP link goes down you will need to
stop and restart the Microsoft DNS server service to rebind the service to its
RAS IP address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
