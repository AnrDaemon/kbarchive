SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Exchange Server Outlook Web Access (OWA) to list the
views on a folder, custom views created by Microsoft Outlook do not show up in
the view selector. Custom views created by the Microsoft Exchange client are
available.

This is because OWA does not read views stored in Outlook format. In order to
access these views using OWA, save the views in Exchange format using Outlook.
This can be done in Outlook by opening the properties page of the folder and
selecting Automatically Generate Microsoft Exchange Views on the General Tab.
