TITLE   :Microsoft Cluster Server Requires Service Pack 3 or Later.
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) requires Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise
Edition version 4.0 with at least Service Pack 3. If you remove the service pack
or install an earlier version, the following error may appear in the system
event log:

   Event:       1012
   Source:      ClusSvc
   Description: Microsoft Cluster Server did not start because the current
                version of Windows NT is not correct.  Microsoft Cluster
                Server runs only on Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition.

If you attempt to install MSCS on a server that does not run the Enterprise
Edition of Windows NT and/or does not have at least Service Pack 3, the
following message may be displayed:

   Microsoft Cluster Server runs on either Windows NT 5.0 or on Windows NT
   4.0 with Service Pack 3 or higher. Please install the correct version or
   service pack and run setup again.

CAUSE
=====

The Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Windows NT requires that Service Pack 3 or
later be installed on the server. MSCS has the same service pack requirement as
Enterprise Edition.

This error may be caused by performing an in-place upgrade of the existing
Windows NT installation with the same version of Windows NT without reapplying
the service pack.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve either of these situations, make sure the server runs the Enterprise
Edition of Windows NT Server with Service Pack 3 or later.
