KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 99 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft Bookshelf on a workstation from a network
drive, you may receive the following error message:

   The file <drive>:\Office\Msreftl.dll could not be opened.

CAUSE
=====

The server may be running network operating system software that does not
support long filenames.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade your network operating system software to a version that supports long
filenames.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error occurs because the file Msreftl.dll is normally installed to the path
Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Reference Titles. Because this path
contains long filenames, the file cannot be installed.

For more information on using Bookshelf on networks and servers, please see the
Bookshelf Network Administrator's Guide.
