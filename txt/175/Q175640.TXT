SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses information on how to configure a Routing and Remote
Access Service (RRAS) LAN-to-LAN Routing Dial-on-Demand (DOD) connection over
Nwlink.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure a RRAS LAN-to-LAN Routing DOD connection over Nwlink, start the
RRAS Administration utility, and then perform the following steps:

1. Right-click the LAN and Demand Dial Interfaces key, and click Add Interface.

   a. The name to be typed MUST be the name of a valid user account on the
      Dial-up RRAS server, and then click Next.

   b. Select "Route IPX packets on this interface" only, and then click Next.

   c. Type the telephone number of the Dial-up server, and then click Next.

   d. Type the user name, domain, and password of a valid user account on the
      Dial-up server, and then click Finish.

   e. Select Enable IPX on this Interface and make sure that both locations are
      set to use the same Dial In Control Protocol, then click OK.

   f. Make sure that Accept Broadcasts are enabled. If Always is selected, a
      Demand-Dial connection will be established whenever a Windows NT- based
      router receives a NetBIOS over IPX broadcast. If Statically Seeded is
      selected, only broadcast packets that are defined for a statically
      configured NetBIOS name, configured under the Static NetBIOS Names key,
      will be propagated. If only When Interface is Up is Selected it will act
      as if it was configured for Always, but only when the DOD connection is
      active. Click OK.

   g. Make sure that the Update Mode for RIP for IPX is set to Auto- Static,
      then click OK.

   h. Make sure that the Update Mode for SAP for IPX is set to Auto- Static,
      then click OK.

2. Select the NetBIOS Broadcasts key, and make sure that both the Internal and
   External network interface cards (NICs) are configured to Accept and Deliver
   NetBIOS Broadcasts. If either NIC is not configured to Accept and Deliver
   NetBIOS broadcasts, then right-click the NetBIOS Boradcasts key, and then
   click Configure Interface.

3. Each interface should be set to Accept Broadcasts and Deliver Broadcasts and
   be set to Always for full LAN-to-LAN connectivity.

4. Select the RIP for IPX key, and make sure that both the Internal and External
   NICs are configured to perform in a Standard update mode. If either NIC is
   not configured in this manner, right-click the RIP for IPX key, and then
   click Configure Interface.

5. Configure each interface to perform in a Standard update mode.

6. Select the SAP for IPX key and make sure that both the Internal and External
   NICs are configured to perform in a Standard update mode If either NIC is not
   configured in this manner, right-click the SAP for IPX key, and then click
   Configure Interface.

7. Make sure that the Update Mode for both the Internal and External NIC is set
   to Standard.

8. Right-click the Static NetBIOS Names key if you are using a Statically Seeded
   delivery method for NetBIOS Resolution, and click Add NetBIOS Name.

9. Type the NetBIOS name of the remote computer that you wish to connect to.
   Leave the Type field blank so it will propagate all computer types associated
   with the name. Click the DOD connection that will be used to communicate with
   the other RRAS router.

10. After the steps above have been performed on both RRAS servers, select the
   IPX Routing Summary key, and click the DOD connection that will be used to
   communicate with the other RRAS router. Right-click the IPX Routing Summary
   key, and then click Connect.

11. After you've connected, select IPX Routing Summary key, and then the DOD
   connection that will be used to communicate with the other Steelhead router.

12. Right-click the IPX Routing Summary key, and then click Update Routes.

At this point, Nwlink LAN-to-LAN routing should be successfully installed, and
full network connectivity is available.
