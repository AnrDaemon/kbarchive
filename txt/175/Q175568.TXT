TITLE   :XADM: Pause Option Not Available With Exchange Admin on Cluster
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Cluster Service Administrator page only lists online and offline
options for the Exchange services; a Pause option is not available. Because
pausing a service, such as the Directory Exchange Agent (DXA), may be necessary,
this can be a problem.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT Cluster Service Administrator page does not allow a paused status
for a service. Therefore, Pause is not an option. Only online and offline
options are available.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Pause button and paused status can be viewed from the Control Panel Services
icon. The following steps are recommended if pausing a service is necessary:

1. In Windows NT Cluster Service Administrator, take the Exchange service
   offline.

2. From the Control Panel Services icon, start the Exchange service.

3. As required, pause the Exchange service from the Control Panel.

4. When you finish performing any tasks to the Exchange Server computer,
   continue the service (it should start running again).

5. In Windows NT Cluster Service Administrator, bring the Exchange service
   online.
