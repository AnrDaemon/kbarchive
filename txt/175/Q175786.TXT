TITLE   :XWEB: Outlook Web Access Creates a Profile Marked as Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

For users with an Exchange or Outlook client only, creating and then deleting
all profiles will display this behavior also.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use either the Microsoft Exchange client or Microsoft Outlook client to
access your Exchange Server mailbox for the first time, the Exchange Profile
Wizard starts automatically. However, if you access your mailbox for the first
time using a Microsoft Outlook Web Access client, the Profile Wizard is not
started. If you subsequently run either the Exchange client or Outlook client,
you will see the Choose Profile dialog box, but there will be no profiles to
choose from.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the OWA client created a profile, but marked it as deleted.
Therefore, the Choose Profile dialog box is empty, because deleted profiles are
not displayed. Additionally, because there is a profile created from the OWA
startup, the Profile Wizard will not start automatically.

This behavior is by product design.
