TITLE   :XWEB: Error Msg: Failed to Get Inbox in Outlook Web Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to Outlook Web Access (OWA), a Failed to Get Inbox error message
may appear, even though the mailbox information you entered was correct.

CAUSE
=====

The error may occur if you bypass the authenticated domain logon by pressing the
Escape key. Additionally, the error may occur if you have logged on to Outlook
Web Access, logged off, and then logged on as a different user. This is because
the browser caches the original logon credentials.

WORKAROUND
==========

Restart the client browser or clear the browser cache.
