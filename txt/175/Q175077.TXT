TITLE   :SMS: Audit Gets "No Data Available" Message After Full Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbsms120 kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a full inventory is added to the database, the Audited Packages icon in
Personal Computer Properties shows "No Data Available." The audited packages
appear if you click on the history records.

CAUSE
=====

When a full inventory (that is, both hardware and software inventory together)
is run, and Inventory Dataloader adds the inventory to the database, Dataloader
looks at the current entries for the client's dwMachineID. If entries exist, and
they are not contained in the new "full" MIF, Dataloader removes them from the
current record and adds them to the history record for the client.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, view audited packages as historical records, where
they will appear correctly.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Software Auditing is not intended to be used for targeting workstation package
distribution. Precise software inventory of workstations should be done using
software inventory rules (Inventory Packages), because they are more efficient
and accurate.
