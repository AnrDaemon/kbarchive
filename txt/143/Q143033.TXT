SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 using Jet's DAO model, there are two Properties
that can help you determine the current cursor position or that you can use to
set the cursor to a certain position.

This article will demonstrate both properties and give you some ideas on when to
use one or the other.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According information from the online Help, the description of the
AbsolutePosition is as follows:

Returns or sets the relative record number of a Recordset object's current
record. Applies to the Recordset Object as a Dynaset-type or Snapshot-
type(except for forward-only Snapshots and passthrough queries).

According information from the online Help, the description of the
PercentPosition is as follows:

Returns or sets a value that indicates or changes the approximate location of the
current record in the Recordset object based on a percentage of the records in
the Recordset. Applies to all three types of Recordset Objects (except for
forward-only Snapshots and passthrough queries).

In the following code, I use the rs.MoveLast method before referring to
rs.PercentPosition. This is because PercentPosition is dependent on RecordCount,
and AbsolutePosition is not. The RecordCount property is not accurate until you
move to the end of your Recordset object. Also keep in mind that RecordCount is
not always 100 percent accurate, it is just an estimate of the number of rows in
your recordset, and therefore PercentPosition is not always accurate--but
AbsolutePosition is always accurate. For instance, a dynaset in a multi-user
environment does not reflect rows other users have added until you issue the
refresh method.


Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N) if
   Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two Command buttons(Command1, Command2), four Labels (Label1, Label2,
   Label3, Label4), one Data Control(Data1) and one Text box(Text1) to Form1.
   Place Label1 to the left of Text1 and place Label2 next to the Data control.
   Place Label3 next to the Command1 button and place Label4 next to the
   Command2 button.

3. Set the following properties for each control:

   Default   Property        Set to
   -----------------------------------------------
   Command1   Caption        AbsolutePosition
   Command2   Caption        PercentPosition
   Data1      DatabaseName   BIBLIO.MDB
   Data1      RecordSource   Titles
   Label1     Caption        Enter a Number:
   Text1      Text
   Label2     Caption
   Label2     DataSource     Data1
   Label2     DataField      Title
   Label3     Caption
   Label4     Caption

4. Add the following code to the Command1_Click event:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
        Dim rs1 As Recordset
        Set rs1 = Data1.Recordset
        rs1.MoveLast
        rs1.AbsolutePosition = Val(Text1.Text)
        Label3.Caption = "Absolute Results: " & rs1("title")
      End Sub

5. Add the following code to the Command2_Click event:

      Private Sub Command2_Click()
        Dim rs2 As Recordset
        Set rs2 = Data1.Recordset
        rs2.MoveLast    'RecordCount now accurate
        rs2.PercentPosition = Val(Text1.Text)
        Label4.Caption = "Percent Results: " & rs2("title")
      End Sub

6. From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT, R, S), or press the F5 key to run the
   program. Enter a number from 1 to 100 into Text1. Press the Command1 button,
   then press the Command2 button. Look at the different results in Label3
   versus Label4. You can test the location by selecting the arrow keys of the
   Data control also.

   You can experiment with different numbers to get different results. The
   PercentPosition property is good for helping in displaying a status bar type
   of indicator. The AbsolutePosition property could be used as a reference for
   jumping to certain records, but you could use a BookMark as well.
