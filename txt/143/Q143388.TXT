TITLE   :16-bit Windows Programs May Not Start
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run a 16-bit Windows program in its own memory space, an
error message may briefly appear on the screen, and the program may not start.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions exists:

 - Folders in the path to the program (.exe) file contain long file names
   (LFNs).

 - Folders in the path to the program file contain extended characters.

NOTE: There may be other possible causes for this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use one or more of the following methods:

 - Change the folder names in the path so that they do not contain extended
   characters.

 - Rename folders so that they conform to the MS-DOS 8.3 naming convention.

 - Do not run the program in a separate memory space. This causes the program to
   be run in a shared memory space within a single Windows-On- Windows (WOW)
   environment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT 3.5 and
3.51. This problem is resolved in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
