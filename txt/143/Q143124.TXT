======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The PC BIOS/Category property of a non-IBM microchannel computer is displayed as
an IBM PS/2 Model 70/80 in Systems Management Server.

CAUSE
=====

INVDOS collects the BIOS version and revision information of client computers
for Systems Management Server. When Systems Management Server detects that the
BIOS of a client computer supports the micro-channel bus and the system model
number is not available, the client computer is identified as an IBM PS/2 Model
70/80.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft
does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
