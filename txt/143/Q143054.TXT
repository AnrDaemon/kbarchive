-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive one of the following error messages and Windows 95 may stop
responding (hang) or run with limited functionality:

 - 

   RUNDLL32.EXE has caused an error in COMMCTRL.DLL

 - 

   The COMCTL32.DLL file cannot start.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if the Commctrl.dll file is missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then choose Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

2. Type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each line:

   cd \windows\system
   ren commctrl.dll commctrl.old

3. Use the Extract tool to extract the Kommctrl.dll file from the Precopy1.cab
   file on disk 1 of your Windows 95 disks or in the Win95 folder on the Windows
   95 CD-ROM to the Windows\System folder.

   NOTE: The Precopy1.cab file also contains a Commctrl.dll file. This file is
   used only by Setup. If you extract this file instead of the Kommctrl.dll
   file, Windows 95 will not run.

   For information about using the Extract tool, please see the following article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q129605 How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files

4. Type the following lines, pressing ENTER after each line:

   cd \windows\system
   ren kommctrl.dll commctrl.dll

5. Type the following line, and then press ENTER:

   copy commctrl.dll c:\windows\sysbckup

   When you are prompted to overwrite the existing file, press Y.

6. Restart your computer.
