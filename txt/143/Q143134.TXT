KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) network adapter in an
unattended setup or a Computer Profile Setup (CPS) of Windows NT, the following
error message appears:

   A network card of this type is already installed in the system. Do you want
   to continue?"

If you click OK, you may make changes or accept the network adapter
configuration. If you click Continue, the following error message appears:

   The dependency service or group failed to start. This error prevented the
   network from starting.

If you click OK, the following error message appears:

   The network software failed to start successfully. Choose YES to return to
   the Network dialog to reconfigure the software. If you choose NO to continue
   with the installation you will be unable to join a domain at the present
   time.

CAUSE
=====

The OEMSETUP.INF file for many OEM network adapters do not support unattended
setup or CPS.

WORKAROUND
==========

A few tips for customizing OEMSETUP.INF files are included below. For more
information, refer to the Programmer's Guide included in the Windows NT DDK,
contact Microsoft Consulting Services or contact a Solution Provider.

The Enterprise Customer Unit does not support the modification of OEMSETUP.INF
files.

WARNING: Modification of Setup files can cause serious, system-wide problems
before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
modification of the Setup files can be solved. Make Setup file modifications at
your own risk.

To prevent user interaction during Setup, either skip the code fragments using
the GOTO function or comment out code fragments by adding a semicolon (;) to the
beginning of a line.

You can skip code using the GOTO function. Many Network INF files in Windows NT
are designed by using this method. This can be considered a solution suitable
for CPS or Unattended Setup, as well as manual or interactive Setup. Make sure
you understand the implications of skipping code - results in the symptoms
mentioned above.

Example
-------

      installadapter = +
      Debug-Output "At installadapter"
      ;
      ;  First, check whether the same version of the software exists
      ;
      ;; As a workaround for CPS and Unattended Setup, the below lines have
      ;  been added:
      ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == "YES"
        goto skipoptions
      endif

   NOTE: In many cases, the skipoptions section may be called nextstep.
   Look at your OEMSETUP.INF file to verify the appropriate section name.

Commenting Out Code:

Commenting out code fragments should only be considered a workaround for CPS and
Unattended Setup. Subsequent manual installation or configuration of the Network
adapter software may result in symptoms mentioned above. Make sure you
understand the implications of commenting out code. When possible, skip code
using the method described above.

Example 1
---------

      installadapter = +
      Debug-Output "At installadapter"
      ;
      ;  First, check whether the same version of the software exists
      ;
      ;; As a workaround for CPS and Unattended Setup, the below lines are
      ;  commented out by prepending a semicolon.
      ;    OpenRegKey $(!REG_H_LOCAL) "" $(ProductKeyName) $(MAXIMUM_ALLOWED)
      KeyProduct
      ;    Ifstr $(KeyProduct) != $(KeyNull)
      ;
      ; Same version already existed in the local machine
      ; Popup the dialog and ask the user whether he wants to continue
      ;
      ;   CloseRegKey $(KeyProduct)
      ; ifstr(i) !(NTN_RegBase) == $(ProductKeyName)
      ;
      ; Cannot Install the same software again
      ;
      ;   Shell $(UtilityInf), VerExistedDlg, $(ProductSoftwareTitle),+
      ;   $(ProductVersion)
      ;   ifint $($ShellCode) != $(!SHELL_CODE_OK)
      ;     Debug-Output "ShellCode error: cannot get an error string."
      ;     goto ShellCodeError
      ;   endif
      ;   goto end
      ; else
      ;
      ; Add a new adapter card?
      ;
      ;   Shell $(UtilityInf), CardExistedDlg
      ;   ifint $($ShellCode) != $(!SHELL_CODE_OK)
      ;     Debug-Output "ShellCode error: cannot get an error string."
      ;     goto ShellCodeError
      ;   endif
      ;     ifstr(i) $($R1) != "OK"
      ;       goto end
      ;     endif
      ;     set OldVersionExisted = $(TRUE)
      ;   endif
      ; endif

Example 2
---------

      ;===================================================
      ;  Netcard Detection logic
      ;
      ;   Check that this card's parameters can be
      ;   fully detected.
      ;
      ;; As a workaround for CPS and Unattended Setup, the below line is
      ;  commented out by prepending a semicolon.
      ; Shell $(ParamInf) Param_ParameterConfidence
        Ifstr(i) $($R0) != STATUS_SUCCESSFUL
        Debug-Output "OEMNADIN.INF: parameter confidence too low to bypass
        configuration"

Example 3
---------

      ;; As a workaround for CPS and Unattended Setup, the below lines are
      ;  commented out by prepending a semicolon.
      ;===================================================
      ;Display configuration dialog if confidence is too low. This is to
      ;provide
      ;the user the opportunity to verify or modify the settings manually.
      ;
      ; ui start "InputDlg"
      ;    ifstr(i) $(DLGEVENT) == "CONTINUE"
      ;     Set IRQValue = $(Combo1Out)
      ;        Set IOAddrValue = $(Combo2Out)
      ;   Set IOReadyValue = ~($(IOReadyListExt),$(Combo3Out))
      ;        Set IOReadyValue = ~($(IOReadyList),$(Combo3Out))
      ;   Set TransceiverValue = ~($(TransceiverList),$(Combo4Out))
      ;   ui pop 1
      ;    else-ifstr(i) $(DLGEVENT) == "BACK"
      ;   set CommonStatus = STATUS_USERCANCEL
      ;   Debug-Output "Action: exit. Bye."
      ;   ui pop 1
      ;   goto end
      ;    else
      ;   Debug-Output "Action: unknown. Bye."
      ;   ui pop 1
      ;   goto end
      ;    endif

Example 4
---------

      ;   Verify parameter values selected. Give the user a chance to retry
      ;   or force the options given.
      ;
      Set from = adapteroptions
      Set to = skipoptions
      ;; As a workaround for CPS and Unattended Setup, the below lines are
      ;  commented out by prepending a semicolon.
      ;  Shell $(UtilityInf),RegistryErrorString,VERIFY_WARNING
      ;  ifint $($ShellCode) != $(!SHELL_CODE_OK)
      ;    Debug-Output "ShellCode error: cannot get an error string."
      ;    goto ShellCodeError
      ;  endif
      ;  set Error = $($R0)
      ;  Goto Warning

To retrieve adapter parameters from an answer file, you must modify the
OEMSETUP.INF file. The Unattended Setup answer file is called UNATTEND.TXT. The
CPS answer file is located in %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\DEFAULTS.INF on the
distribution share.

Example
-------

      writeparameters = +
      Debug-Output "At writeparameters"
      ;
      ;   Add the rest of the parameters to the Services area
      ;
      Ifstr(i) $(MachineType) == "MCA"
         set NewValueList =

      {{BusType,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(BusTypeNum)},+
         {McaPosId,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(NETCARD_ID)},+
         {SlotNumber,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(SlotNum)},+
         {MediaType,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),1}}

      else

         Set IOAddrValue = *($(IOAddrValues),
         ~($(IOAddrList),$(IOAddrValue)))

         Shell "" DebugConfiguration "Before Writing Parameters"
         set NewValueList =

      {{INTERRUPT,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(IRQValue)},+

         {BusType,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(BusInterfaceType)},+
         {BusNumber,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(BusNumber)},+
         {MediaType,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),1},+
         {IoChannelReady,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(IOReadyValue)},+
         {Transceiver,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(TransceiverValue)},+
         {IOADDRESS,$(NoTitle),$(!REG_VT_DWORD),$(IOAddrValue)}}

      endif

      Shell  $(UtilityInf), AddValueList, $(KeyParameters), $(NewValueList)
      ;;  Following lines added for CPS or Unattended Setup
      ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == "YES"

        Shell $(UtilityInf),AddDefaultNetCardParameters,$(KeyParameters)

      endif
