PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT primary domain controller (PDC) and a Windows NT client computer
reside on the same physical subnet and the same domain. The client computer can
connect to a network share on the PDC. In the Windows NT PDC, the following
system event appears in Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 8003
   Description: The master browser has received a server announcement from the
   computer <Windows NT client> that believes that it is the master
   browser for the domain on transport <NetBT>. The master browser is
   stopping or an election is being forced.

In the Windows NT client computer, the following system events appear in Event
Viewer:

   Event ID: 8009
   Description: The browser was unable to promote itself to master browser. The
   computer that currently believes it is the master browser is <PDC>.

   Event ID: 8019
   Description: The browser was unable to promote itself to master browser. The
   browser will continue to attempt to promote itself to the master browser, but
   will no longer log any events in Event Viewer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the subnet mask of the Windows NT client computer is
incorrect or different from the PDC. The client computer attempts to promote
itself to the master browser of the subnet and fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, change the TCP/IP protocol configuration to the correct
subnet mask.
