SUMMARY
=======

BOOTP relay agents are not able to successfully service all DHCP client
computers from a LAN segment using multiple logical IP subnets. Only one of the
logical IP subnets is able to obtain DHCP IP addresses for its DHCP client
computers.

For additional information on DHCP with multiple logical IP subnets when you are
not using relay agents, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q124026
   TITLE : Requests Fail on Logically Multihomed Server (Single NIC)

MORE INFORMATION
================

A router implemented as a BOOTP relay agent must insert its IP address in the
gateway IP address (giaddr) field of the DHCP Discover packet. A DHCP server
uses the giaddr field to determine the subnet that sent the request for IP
addresses and which IP addresses to offer. If the giaddr field is blank, the
DHCP server assumes that the request is from the local subnet.

The following is an excerpt from RFC 1542:

   If the relay agent does decide to relay the request, it MUST examine the
   "giaddr" ("gateway" IP address) field. If this field is zero, the relay agent
   MUST fill this field with the IP address of the interface on which the
   request was received. If the interface has more than one IP address logically
   associated with it, the relay agent SHOULD choose one IP address associated
   with that interface and use it consistently for all BOOTP messages it relays.

Because only one address is used in the giaddr field by the relay agent, only one
of the logical subnets is serviced through DHCP.
