SUMMARY
=======

Most World Wide Web (WWW) Browsers running on non-Microsoft network operation
systems rely on a Domain Name Server (DNS) and a Hosts file to resolve Host
names to IP addresses, even if the Web client and the Web server are on the same
subnet.

However, Microsoft Internet Explorer, does not only use the DNS and HOSTS file,
but uses Windows Internet Name Service (WINS), the LMHOSTS file, and NetBIOS
broadcasts for name resolution when it is running on Microsoft network operating
systems such as Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups with Microsoft
TCP/IP stacks installed. However, a NetBIOS broadcast resolves the name only if
the WWW server is running on Windows NT and both WWW Server and WWW client is on
the same subnet.

For additional information on name resolution, please see the following articles
