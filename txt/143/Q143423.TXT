The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to set or read the Font property of a column in a DBGrid control
results in error 438 - "Object doesn't support this property or method."

RESOLUTION
==========

The individual columns of the DBGrid control cannot be set to a specific font.
The column objects of the DBGrid control do not support this property. Page 138
of the "Microsoft Visual Basic Language Reference," as well as the online help
incorrectly document "Font" as being a property of the individual columns of the
Columns collection.

Use the Object Browser to determine what properties are supported by an object.
To launch the Object Browser, when Visual Basic is running, click the F2 key, or
click the Object Browser on the View menu.

To determine what properties are supported by the DBGrid control, select the
MSDBGrid - Apex Data Bound Grid Library from the Libraries / Project drop-down
combo box. In the Classes / Module list, select Column. The methods and
properties supported by this object are listed on the right.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
