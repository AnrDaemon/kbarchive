SUMMARY
=======

You can use the 32-bit PowerPoint Viewer to print a presentation. Note, however,
that when you print from PowerPoint Viewer, you have fewer print options that
you do in PowerPoint.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use PowerPoint Viewer to print a presentation, you can only print
slides (you can't print notes, handouts, or outline pages). Also, PowerPoint
Viewer prints all of the slides in a presentation. In addition, if you print to
a black and white printer, the slides are printed in black and white view.

Note that even though the Print dialog box in PowerPoint Viewer has buttons for
printing a partial slide range, the buttons are unavailable.
