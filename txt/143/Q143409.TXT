SUMMARY
=======

Using the GetFileTitle() CFile member function to return the file's title may
return the extension as well. However, the documentation for this member
function does not fully describe this "by design" behavior.

This was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior of CFile::GetFileTitle() member function has changed in Windows 95.
The expected behavior is described here.

From the Win32 SDK GetFileTitle() documentation:

In Windows 95, the GetFileTitle() function retrieves the same text that the
system would compose in displaying a file name to the user. This text is
intended to be used for display purposes only and is in accordance with the
user's preferences for display of filenames. There are two important
implications of this enhancement: First, an application cannot expect to use the
resultant text to call file system functions because it is merely a display
name; Second, in preserving the function's "insufficient buffer" case, the
return value for that code path reflects the size of the text that would be
composed in the normal case such that the caller may attempt to allocate
sufficient storage and retrieve the result with a subsequent call to
GetFileTitle(). More generally, there is no guaranteed connection between the
resultant text or return value and the characters in the original buffer passed
by the application.

In porting applications to Windows 95, you need to update any code that relies on
such behavior in previous versions of the operating system. The most common case
is code that deliberately calls GetFileTitle() with a NULL return buffer,
passing size 0, and then uses the return value as an index into the original
string. This technique is no longer supported. Applications can usually achieve
similar results (and superior performance) with run-time library functions such
as strrchr, wcsrchr, and _mbsrchr.
