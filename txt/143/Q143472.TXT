TITLE   :FPNW Blue Screens Accessing or Creating Folders with Long Paths
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If your network client uses Novell's MS-DOS real-mode redirector, NETX, you may
experience one of the following problems:

 - When you attempt to create a directory where the total path length is greater
   than 255 characters on a FPNW server, you may experience a blue screen error.

 - When you attempt to access a directory where the total path length is greater
   than 128 characters on a FPNW server, FPNW becomes unstable and a blue screen
   error normally occurs during the shut down of FPNW.

CAUSE
=====

You experience a blue screen error when you attempt to create a folder with a
path greater than 255 characters because FPNW does not perform limit checking on
the path length when the request is made. This problem only affects NETX clients
because all other Novell NetWare clients perform limit checking before they
submit the request to the server.

You experience a blue screen error when you attempt to access a folder with a
path greater than 128 characters due to problems converting the folder path
string to Unicode within the FPNW server. This only affects NETX clients because
all other Novell NetWare clients' use different NCP's (Network Control Protocol)
which do not experience this problem when they submit a change directory
request.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform one of the following steps to resolve these problems:

 - Obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

 - Use a Novell's VLM client on MS-DOS-based computers instead of NETX.

 - Do not create folders with paths greater than 128 characters.

STATUS
======
