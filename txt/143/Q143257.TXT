PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Microsoft Plus! on a hard disk other than the hard disk
on which Windows 95 is installed, you may receive the following error message:

   There is not enough disk space to complete installation. You can change your
   installation options, continue installation, or exit Setup.

You may receive this message even if there is enough room on the hard disk to
install Microsoft Plus!.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Microsoft Plus! on a hard disk other than the hard disk on
which Windows 95 is installed, Microsoft Plus! Setup uses approximately 18
megabytes (MB) of space on the hard disk on which Windows 95 is installed. This
space is used for temporary files that are removed when Setup is finished, and
for additional files that remain on the hard disk after Setup is finished. These
additional files can include .dll, .vxd, .inf, .exe, .cur, .ani, .scr, .hlp, and
.cnt files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, remove files from the hard disk on which Windows
95 is installed so that there is at least 18 MB of free space on the hard disk.
If you cannot remove enough files to create 18 MB of free hard disk space, you
may be able to reduce the size or change the location of the Windows swap file.
For information about modifying swap file settings, view the "Reserving disk
space for extra memory" topic in Windows 95 Help, or see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
