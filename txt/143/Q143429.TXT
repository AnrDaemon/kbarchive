PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:_IK920 kbVC kbVC400bug kbVC410fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When two or more OLE Custom Controls are placed in a dialog inside Microsoft
Developer Studio and that dialog is tested (by pressing CTRL+T), the Developer
Studio will cause an alignment fault and will be shut down.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only current workaround is to avoid testing dialogs containing two or more
OLE Custom Controls inside the Developer Studio. Instead the dialog can be
tested by instantiating the associated dialog class and calling the DoModal()
member function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
