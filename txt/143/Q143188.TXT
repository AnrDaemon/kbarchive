SUMMARY
=======

When you install the Gopher Server from the Internet Information Server, four
new objects are added to the existing list of objects. This article describes an
object called "Gopher server" which contains 19 counters.

Performance Monitor is a graphical tool for measuring the performance of your own
computer or other computers on a network. On each computer, you can view the
behavior of objects such as processors, memory, cache, threads, and processes.
Each of these objects has an associated set of counters that provide information
on such things as device usage, queue lengths, and delays, as well as
information used for throughput and internal congestion measurements. It
provides charting, alerting, and reporting capabilities that reflect current
activity along with ongoing logging. You can also open log files at a later time
for browsing and charting as if they were reflecting current activity.
