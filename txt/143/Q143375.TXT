The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

There are instances when an Exchange Mail client receives multiple copies of the
same message that is sent from the Internet via the Internet Mail Connector
(IMC) or by a Microsoft Mail 3.x client via the Microsoft Mail Connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This happens if the Exchange recipient belongs to multiple Distribution Lists
(DL). For instance, if user1 belongs to Distribution List 1 (DL1) and to
Distribution List 2 (DL2) and an Internet or Microsoft Mail 3.x client sends to
both DL's then the Exchange client receives two copies of the same message. If
DL2 is a member of DL1, then the Exchange recipient receives three messages.

This is by design. It is an X.400 feature. The Exchange Server tries to eliminate
duplicates, but for mail coming from external sources, the needed information to
accomplish the task is not available.
