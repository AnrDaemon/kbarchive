SYMPTOMS

When using a Compaq server or workstation configured with a 10 GB/20 GB DLT
Drive in a Windows NT 3.51 environment, the tape backup utility in
Administrative Tools may report an inaccurate error message similar to the
following:

   No tape in drive

   Foreign tape

Also, when you run Ntbackup from the command line, it may cause an access
violation with Dr. Watson.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Never start the tape backup application while the Tape In Use console light
   on the tape drive is flashing.

2. When the green Operate Handle console light on the tape drive lights up,
   remove the tape and reinsert it.
