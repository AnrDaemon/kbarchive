The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the Remote Registry service to remotely administer a
computer running the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS),
you may receive one of the following error messages:

 - Unable to connect to <computer name>. Make sure that this computer is
   on the network, has remote administration enabled, and that both computers
   are running remote registry service.

 - Unable to connect to <computer name>. Make sure you have permission to
   administer the computer.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

 - You attempt to use the Remote Registry service while you are logged on to a
   NetWare Directory Services (NDS) tree, and you are using a server for
   user-level security that is part of the same NDS tree.

 - You are logging on to an NDS tree and your password on the NDS tree is
   different than the password for your account on the server that is providing
   user-level security.

 - Bindery emulation is not set to the correct container on the NetWare 4.x
   server you are using for user-level security.

RESOLUTION
==========

To connect to a remote workstation using the Remote Registry service with MSNDS,
the following requirements must be met:

 - Both workstations must be set up for the Remote Registry service.

 - Both workstations must have Remote Administration set up correctly. For
   additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   Q141460 How to Install Remote Administration Services

 - User-level security must be installed and set to a bindery-based NetWare
   server that is not part of the NDS tree. The server can be either a NetWare
   3.x server or a NetWare 4.x server with bindery emulation set for the
   container where user accounts reside. This server cannot be a member of the
   NDS tree you log on to.

 - Your password for the NDS tree must be the same as the password on the server
   you are using for user-level security.

   NOTE: If your password for the user-level security server has been cached, it
   is possible to use a different password for logging on to the NDS tree.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Remote Registry service requires the use of user-level security and is
currently a bindery-based tool that does not understand NDS. Therefore, the
server used for user-level security must not be part of the NDS tree you are
logging on to.
