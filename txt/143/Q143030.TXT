TITLE   :RAS Clients Not Able to Connect to RAS Server's Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you connect to a Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) server and your
RAS client computer is assigned an IP address from the RAS server, the RAS
client computer is not able to connect to any computer on the RAS server's
network.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when more than 12 IP addresses are configured for the Remote
Access server's Network Card. An internal buffer overflow occurs and the RAS
server does not properly respond to ARP requests for the RAS client. The RAS
client computer can use PING and connect to shares on the RAS server only.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, apply the fix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
