SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Macintosh workstation version 3.0 and higher, you may receive
the following error message:

   Microsoft Mail Fatal Error:
   Could not create preferences file in System Folder

NOTE: The only button available in this dialog is Finder, which will return you
to the Finder.

CAUSE
=====

The preferences file is either locked or corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine if the file is locked:

1. Open the System Folder.

2. Select the file MS Mail/PC LANs Prefs.

3. From the File menu, choose Get Info.

If the Locked check box is selected, clear it and close the dialog box.

If the preferences file is not locked, it may be corrupt. The MS Mail/PC LANs
Prefs file is recreated when you run the workstation. Therefore, you can drag
the file to the trash, and run the workstation to check for corruption.
