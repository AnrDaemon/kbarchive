TITLE   :FIX: NODEFAULT in Page's Deactivate Event Activates Wrong Tab
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using NODEFAULT in the Page's Deactivate event stops the current page from
changing, but the tab of the page will not be active. Whichever tab is clicked,
the tab - 1 is the one that is brought forward. Therefore, if you are located on
page one and click the fourth page, tab 3 will be moved to the front yet page
one's objects continue to show on the pageframe.

WORKAROUND
==========

Move the NODEFAULT condition to the Activate event of each page. Create one
property in the form, and make it store the current page of the pageframe. The
default value should be 1. In the Activate event for each page, evaluate the
variables to see if the page should come forward. If it shouldn't come forward
based on certain conditions, issue the NODEFAULT and set the ACTIVEPAGE to the
form property. If the page should come forward, don't use the NODEFAULT clause,
and reset the curPage property to the current page.

Following is an example of what might be used in the Activate event of the page.
CurPage is a form property that stores the current active page in the pageframe.
Lexpression is the condition that must be met before the page will activate.

       IF THISFORM.curPage != 1 AND <lexpression>
        THISFORM.curPage = 1
      ELSE && Resets the active page
        NODEFAULT
        THIS.PARENT.ActivePage = THISFORM.curPage
      ENDIF

The value of curPage in this code would change to the page's number of the
current Activate event. For example, if this code was in the fourth page of the
pageframe, the code would be as follows:

      IF THISFORM.curPage != 4 AND <lexpression>
        THISFORM.curPage = 4
      ELSE && Resets the active page
        NODEFAULT
        THIS.PARENT.ActivePage = THISFORM.curPage
      ENDIF

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
