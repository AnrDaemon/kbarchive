TITLE   :Registry Corruption Detected During Restart of Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an application deletes volatile registry keys, a section of the registry is
written noting the change. When you reboot your computer, Windows NT reads the
section of the registry and does not start.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, repair the registry by starting Windows NT Setup
using the original Setup floppy disk or compact disc. Select 'r' at the first
screen to start repair.

To correct this problem, apply the fix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
