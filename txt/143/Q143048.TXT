SYMPTOMS
========

Unloading a form with a DBGrid control by using the Unload statement in the any
event of the DBGrid control causes an application error that ends the Visual
Basic program. The following are ways to work around this issue:

 - Set the form to nothing prior to unloading the form.

   -or-

 - Unload the form in an event other than a DBGrid event.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example to reproduce this behavior. Two forms are used:

 - The first form has a command button that shows the second form.

 - The second form contains the DBGrid control. The click event of the DBGrid
   control unloads the second form. Run the program and click the command button
   to show the second form. Click the DBGrid control in the second form and the
   application error occurs.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0 or if it is already running, click New Project on the
   File menu.

2. Add a command button to the Form1 form.

3. Copy the following code sample to the Form1 code window:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            'Show Form2
            Form2.Show
         End Sub

4. On the Insert menu, click Form to insert a second form into the project.

5. Add a DBGrid control to the Form2 form and copy the following code sample to
   the Form2 code window:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub DBGrid1_Click()
            'Remove the comment marks from the next two lines
            'to work around the bug.
            'Form2.Hide
            'Set Form2 = Nothing
            Unload Form2
         End Sub

6. On the Run menu, click Start, or press the F5 key to start the program. Click
   the Command1 command button to display the second form. Click on the DBGrid
   control in the second form. An application error occurs with the following
   message and Visual Basic ends:
