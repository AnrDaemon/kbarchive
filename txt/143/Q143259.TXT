SUMMARY
=======

Remote Callback is a Remote Automation process in which a server uses an object
reference to a client class to asynchronously trigger its methods or change its
properties. Callback, or Asynchronous Notification, is especially useful for
monitoring real time data. For a Callback process to be successful, the client
need to be running on a 32-bit system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Remote Automation server attempts to Callback a client object, it makes a
certain request. For instance, the server could request to trigger a client's
method. The automation proxy (AUTPRX32.DLL) on the server side carries this
request across the network. A method request by the automation proxy expects to
be met by the Automation Manager, and then served by the client. In other words,
the client needs to act as a server for the Callback to be successful. Because
16-bit systems cannot run the Automation Manager, they cannot run a Remote
Automation server. Therefore, a 16-bit client cannot be called back remotely.
