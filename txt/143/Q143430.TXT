PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), used with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While browsing for a member function of a C++ class, the browser 'References'
list may not show the source line in which the address of the function is taken.
See the sample code for an example.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code illustrates that the browser correctly shows all the
references to a member variable, but it doesn't show the references to a member
function where the address of the member function is taken.

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: /FR
      */ 

      class CTest
      {
      public:
         // Member function
         void MemFunc();
         // Member variable
         int m_i;
      };

      void CTest::MemFunc()
      {
      }

      // When you browse (Tools/Browse Menu) for the symbol 'MemFunc',
      // the 'References' list shows all the lines where 'MemFunc' is
      // referenced EXCEPT for the following source line.

      // Pointer to member function
      void (CTest::*pmfn)() = &CTest::MemFunc;

      // When you browse for the symbol 'm_i', the 'References' list
      // shows all the lines INCLUDING the following source line.

      // Pointer to member variable
      int CTest::*pmint = &CTest::m_i;

      void main()
      {
         CTest testObj;
         testObj.MemFunc();
         int j = testObj.m_i;
      }
