TITLE   :FIX: Cannot Programmatically Select Items in ListView
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After setting the Selected property of a ListItem in the ListView control to
True, the SelectedItem property returns the last item that was selected with a
mouse click.

RESOLUTION
==========

The code below can be used as a workaround instead of Selected = True.

      Sub SelectAListItem(iItemToSelect%)

            Dim Item As ListItem
            Set Item = ListView1.ListItems(iItemToSelect%)
            Set ListView1.SelectedItem = Item

      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0, or select New Project from the File menu if it is
   already running.

2. Add Command button and Listview controls to the default Form1.

3. Add the following code to Form1:

       Private Sub Form_Load()
          Dim itmX As ListItem
          Dim i As Integer

          For i = 1 To 10
              Set itmX = ListView1.ListItems.Add(, , CStr(i))
          Next i
       End Sub

       Private Sub Command1_Click()
          ListView1.ListItems(5).Selected = True
          MsgBox "Index of selected item is " & ListView1.SelectedItem.Index
       End Sub

4. Press F5 to start the application. Click once on the Command button and see
   that the message box displays the index of the selected item as 1, despite
   the fact that it was set to 5 by the previous line of code.

5. Change the code in the Command1_Click event to the following to fix the
   problem:

       Private Sub Command1_Click()
          Dim item As ListItem

          Set item = ListView1.ListItems(5)
          Set ListView1.SelectedItem = item

          MsgBox "Index of selected item is " & ListView1.SelectedItem.Index
       End Sub
