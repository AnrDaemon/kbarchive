   Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The form does not cover all possible error conditions that you may encounter but
it does handle the process of logging on to SQL Server, establishing a handle,
and allowing entry of data to the Authors table.

The Authors table was used because it has a primary key constraint on the Auth_ID
field, and it also requires that some additional conversion work be done to the
data that is passed through to SQL Server. The field that requires this
conversion is the Contract field, which is defined as a SQL Server field type of
'bit.' All code has been thoroughly commented explaining how and why things were
done in a specific fashion. You must have an ODBC data source to SQL Server 6.x,
and you will also need to edit the connection code found in the form's Load
event.

Additional query words: client server structured query language
