SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the security hotfix (Sec-fix) or Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3,
which includes this hotfix, applications that use null sessions may no longer
work properly.

For example, after you apply the security hotfix to a Windows NT computer running
Cheyenne ARCServe 6.0, you may receive the following error message when you
attempt to schedule a job (for example, local, remote, backup, and restore):

   User doesn't have enough rights to do this
   EC=5

CAUSE
=====

The updated security modules for Windows NT no longer permit null sessions to
access the Windows NT registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform the following steps to resolve this problem:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\

3. Add "winreg" (without the quotation marks) to the NullSessionPipes entry.

4. Restart your computer.
