TITLE   :PRB: Child Property Doesn't Reflect Parent Container Property
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set a child object's property value equal to a parent container's value
and then change the value for the parent container's property, the new value is
not reflected by the child object.

CAUSE
=====

Expressions placed in the child object's property sheet are evaluated once.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you change the parent container's property, you can force a reevaluation of
the child object's property by clicking into the property of the child on the
property sheet and pressing ENTER or by clicking the checkmark in the child
object's property sheet.

When you run the form, Visual FoxPro will evaluate all expressions once to
initialize the altered properties of every object. The exceptions to this are
the DynamicXX properties of the Grid column object. These are evaluated
dynamically when the grid is refreshed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Demonstrate Behavior
-----------------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Place an object such as a command button on the form.

3. In the Property sheet, set the property of the object's FontSize to
   Thisform.FontSize. After you press ENTER, the child object should pick up the
   value from the parent container.

4. Change the parent container's FontSize value. Note that the child does not
   pick up the new value until you force the form to reevaluate the parent
   container's value.
