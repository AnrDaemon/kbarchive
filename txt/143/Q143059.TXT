TITLE   :Network Client 3.0 Removes Most Recent Persistent Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you create several persistent network connections in Network Client 3.0
and attempt to remove a specific network connection, it is not removed. The most
recent persistent network connection is removed. For example, if you have
network connections assigned to drives E, G and F (in this order), and you
attempt to remove drive E, drive F is removed. This problem does not occur if
you use the following command:

   net use e: /d

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Network Client version 3.0
for MS-DOS. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
