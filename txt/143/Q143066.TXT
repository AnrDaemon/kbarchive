-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dogs for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a Microsoft Windows NT Workstation using a Guest account, you
cannot run Microsoft Dogs.

When you double-click on the Dogs icon, you receive the Microsoft Home screen and
then Dogs closes, or exits.

CAUSE
=====

When logged on as a Guest, your access privileges do not allow you to install
software on the computer. Microsoft Dogs writes to the registry when the program
is opened; as a result, Windows NT security believes you are attempting to
install new software and closes Microsoft Dogs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Log on to Windows NT with User or Administrator access privileges.

NOTE: Only the user who first runs Dogs and other users with "Administrator"
privileges will be able to use Dogs. All other users will not be able to.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Dogs for Windows
version 1.0 and 1.0a. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
