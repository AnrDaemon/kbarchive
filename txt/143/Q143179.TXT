TITLE   :Internet Information Server FTP Server Service Fails to Start
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Internet Information Server's (IIS) FTP Server service does not start
after successful installation of IIS on Windows NT 3.51 server. The Internet
Server Manager shows the service in a stopped state.

CAUSE
=====

It is not possible to run more than one FTP Server service on the same Windows
NT server. If the FTP Server service (included with Windows NT Server) was
running during the IIS installation, the FTP Server service in IIS fails to
start.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - Uninstall the Windows NT 3.51 FTP Server service from Control Panel, Networks
   and reboot the server and then start the IIS FTP server service from Internet
   Server Manager.

   -or-

 - Stop the Windows NT 3.51 FTP Server service from Control Panel, Services. It
   is best if you change from Automatic to Manual, so that it will not
   automatically start when the server is rebooted. Then start the IIS FTP
   server service from Internet Server Manager.
