TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Open Custom Recipient in Administrator
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a Custom Recipient that has been loaded into Microsoft
Exchange by directory synchronization (dirsync) from either Microsoft Mail 3.x
or Microsoft Mail for Appletalk Networks and it has non teletex characters ($,
~, ^, $, or #) in the Common Name portion of the Distinguished Name, the
following error might be displayed:

   The object cannot be found in the directory. This may be because replication
   has not completed.
   Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID No. c1010aae

CAUSE
=====

Some dirsynced addresses contain non teletex characters in a field that the
Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization Agent (DXA) uses for the alias
field. This field is also used for the Common Name portion of the Distinguished
Name in the Microsoft Exchange Directory. The Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program uses character mapping (ANSI) to handle the characters, but the DXA
converts these characters differently. The end result is that the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program cannot open these entries.

RESOLUTION
==========

The DXA has been changed to use the same method of character conversion as the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
