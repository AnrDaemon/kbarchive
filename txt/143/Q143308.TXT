======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The TextWidth method of Visual FoxPro for Windows is defined as returning the
length of a text string expressed in a count of units, the units being expressed
in either pixels or foxels depending on the current scalemode of the form.
However, the values are actually returned in pixels, only, regardless of the
scalemode property.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Illustrate this Problem
--------------------------------

In the Visual FoxPro Command window, type the following sequence of commands and
observe the information that is displayed in the upper-left portion of the
desktop:

  x = CreateObject("form")
  ? x.ScaleMode             && returns 3 (pixels, the default)
  ? x.TextWidth("testing")  && shows 42 (pixels, if standard font)
  x.Scalemode = 0           && Foxels
  ? x.TextWidth("testing")  && shows 42 - the pixels measurement
