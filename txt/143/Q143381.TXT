TITLE   :XCLN: New Mail Notification Not Visible with Screen Saver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive new mail on a Windows NT computer that has an active screen
saver, the New Mail notification box will not have the focus. When the screen
saver is disabled, the New Mail notification box is not visible and Microsoft
Exchange appears to be hung.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design. When new mail arrives, the Display a Notification
Message option displays a dialog box stating that new mail has been delivered
and asks if you want to read the new mail now. If the Exchange client is in the
foreground, and new mail is received when the screen saver is active, disabling
the screen saver and clicking anywhere in the Exchange client results in an
error. This is due to the modal nature of the Windows NT Exchange client.

If another application is in the foreground or Microsoft Exchange is minimized
and new mail is delivered when the screen saver is active, press ALT+TAB to get
back to Microsoft Exchange. This will bring the new mail notification to the
foreground.
