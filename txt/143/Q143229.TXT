 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 1.1b, 1.1c

SUMMARY
=======

When you print a Creative Writer card to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet or
DeskWriter printer, the bottom borders may be cut off.

The standard card layout and folding method puts the cropped borders at the
bottom of the cover and back pages of the card. By rearranging the page order
and using a different folding technique, you can make the printer limitation
less noticeable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following steps:

1. When you design the card, switch pages one and three, and switch pages two
   and four.

2. When you fold the card, fold the top edge to the back as usual, then fold the
   left side to the front instead of the back.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP DeskJet and DeskWriter series printers have a large bottom page margin
that cannot be changed. This fixed margin crops some borders at the bottom of
the first and last pages of a Creative Writer card, even when the widest margin
is selected.
