PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER:1.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft 3D Movie Maker for Windows, versions 95, 1.0 
 - Microsoft Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run 3D Movie Maker on a computer using a SoundBlaster AWE 32 card, you
experience MIDI sound problems. Problems include very low volume, or a lack of
MIDI sound from any program you use after running 3D Movie Maker and until you
restart your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Try one of the following resolutions.

Resolution 1
------------

Use the following steps to play MIDI with the Creative Labs SB AWE 32 driver v.
4.11.10:

1. Restart your computer.

2. With the right mouse button, click the Volume control icon located on the
   Windows 95 taskbar, and then click Volume Controls.

3. Set master Volume Control (far left control) to half of the maximum volume
   level.

4. Set Wave volume to maximum volume level.

5. Set MIDI (Synthesizer) volume to maximum volume level.

6. Close Volume Controls.

7. Use Media player to play canyon.mid.

   To find Canyon.mid, do the following:
   1. With you right mouse button, click the Start button, and then click Find.

   2. In the Named: box, type the following:

   " canyon.mid " (without the quotation marks)

   3. In the Look in box, enter the hard drive where you installed Windows. For
      example, enter

   " c:\ " (without the quotation marks)

      where C is the letter of the hard drive where you installed Windows.

   4. Click Find Now.

   5. Double-click Canyon.mid.

8. Set your speaker volume to your preferred setting.

9. Start 3D Movie Maker and create a movie with MIDI sounds.

MIDI should now play correctly.

Resolution 2
------------

Switch the MIDI drive to use FM Synthesis rather than WaveTable Synthesis. To use
FM Synthesis, follow the steps below.

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. Open the Multimedia control panel.

3. Click the MIDI tab.

4. In the MIDI output section, select the FM Synthesis for Single Instrument.

NOTE: Switching to FM Synthesis eliminates the problems with MIDI volumes and 3D
Movie Maker (as well as other products from other vendors), but you may notice
that the FM Synthesis sound quality is lower than the WaveTable Synthesis sound
quality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using Creative Labs, SB AWE 32 driver v.4.12.7 (dated 12/21/95), you
should hear MIDI regardless of system volume levels. With this driver, however,
you can no longer change the volume of individual MIDI sounds in 3D Movie
Maker.

The older (4.11.10) driver incorrectly reports volume settings and always returns
to full volume (100 percent), regardless of the setting. The volume setting is
logarithmic, not linear; anything below 50 percent with this driver is silence.

The newer (4.12.7) driver locks the volume at 100 percent to avoid losing sound
in applications such as 3D Movie Maker.

3D Movie Maker experiences this problem because it allows individual MIDI volumes
adjustments within the program and the driver does not report these volumes
correctly to the system. Most other programs leave MIDI as is or set it to 100
percent.

Other sound boards (such as the UltraSound Max) may display similar problems
because of borrowed hardware or software from Creative Labs AWE 32.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
