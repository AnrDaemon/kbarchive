TITLE   :FTP Server Service Does Not Start
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) FTP server service does not start
after successful installation of IIS on Windows NT 3.51 Server. The Internet
Server Manager shows the "state" as "Stopped".

CAUSE
=====

Your FTP server service (that comes with Windows NT Server) is running during
the IIS installation. This causes the FTP server service included with IIS to
fail to start.

It is not possible to run more than one FTP server service on the same Windows NT
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - Deinstall the Windows NT 3.51 FTP server service from Control Panel, Networks
   and reboot the server and then start IIS FTP server service from Internet
   Server Manager.

   -or-

 - Stop the Windows NT 3.51 FTP server service from Control Panel, Services. It
   is best if you change from Automatic to Manual, so that it will not
   automatically start when the server is rebooted. Then start IIS FTP server
   service from Internet Server Manager.
