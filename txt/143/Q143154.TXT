TITLE   :Indicate Expandable Branches In File Manager Causes Delay
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

SYMPTOMS
========

File Manager performance is excessively slow and causes delays in displaying
directories in extremely large directory structures. Every time a directory is
opened, you see the "Directories read:" message in the lower- left corner of
File Manager.

CAUSE
=====

When Indicate Expandable Branches (on the Tree menu) is enabled in File Manager,
it must open every directory and do a FindFirstFile() to determine if
subdirectories exist (that is, the "+" on the directory folders in File Manager
when Indicate Expandable Branches is enabled).

If Indicate Expandable Branches is not enabled, File Manager uses the directory
list it has already received. This setting is saved in the user's profile.
