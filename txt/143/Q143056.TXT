======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print an e-mail message from MSN, The Microsoft Network, the header is
printed as "Unknown."

If you use Microsoft Project or Microsoft Word to route an MSN e-mail message,
the routing slips do not automatically contain your address.

CAUSE
=====

MSN is not providing your user name for the header or the routing slip.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is currently no way to print the correct header.

For routing slips, in Microsoft Word, open the address book and select your name
in the Check Names dialog box. In Microsoft Project, the last member on the
routing slip must open the address book and select your name to route the
message back to you.

Additional query words: msn
