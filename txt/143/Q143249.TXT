TITLE   :PRB: ORDER BY Field in Result Set Without Being in Field List
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the ORDER BY clause of a SQL SELECT statement, you must include the
the ORDER BY field in the field list. If the ORDER BY field is not included in
the field list, it is added by FoxPro without an error.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. It is clearly documented in the Language Reference
and help file that the ORDER BY field must be in the field list. The following
quote is from the help file under the SELECT SQL topic:

   ORDER BY sorts query results based on data in one or more columns. Each
   Order_Item must correspond to a column in the query results

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Enter the following command in the Command Window:

   SELECT last_name FROM samples/data/employee ORDER BY emp_id

Notice that both last_name and emp_id are in the cursor even though the last_name
field was the only field in the field list.
