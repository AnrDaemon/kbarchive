TITLE   :XADM: Error Message: Error -550 Has Occurred
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server stops responding or is not
shut down gracefully after stopping all the services properly, the following
error message may appear on screen and in the event logs:

   Error -550 has occurred

This message may also appear when you start the directory or information store
service, in case of a power failure.

CAUSE
=====

This error usually means that the database is in an inconsistent state and
cannot start.

NOTE: This problem usually occurs when users move or delete their log files or
database. If the log files are deleted or moved, recovery appears to work (no
log files = no recovery), but the database will be inconsistent. If the database
is moved, recovery will not work (the path to the database is hard-coded in the
log files). If the log files are moved without updating the registry, recovery
will not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

Confirm that the state of the database is inconsistent, and then try a
defragmentation repair. Be sure to stop all services and back up all files
before you run the Edbutil.exe program.

1. Check the state of the database.

Versions 4.0 and 5.0
--------------------

Use Edbutil.exe with the "MH" option on the problem database, and dump the output
to a text file:

   EDBUTIL /MH c:\exchsrvr\dsadata\dir.edb >c:\edbdump.txt

-OR-

   EDBUTIL /MH c:\exchsrvr\mdbdata\priv.edb >c:\edbdump.txt

-OR-

   EDBUTIL /MH c:\exchsrvr\mdbdata\pub.edb >c:\edbdump.txt

Version 5.5
-----------

Use Eseutil.exe with the "MH" option on the problem database, and dump the output
to a text file:

   ESEUTIL /MH c:\exchsrvr\dsadata\dir.edb >c:\edbdump.txt

-OR-

   ESEUTIL /MH c:\exchsrvr\mdbdata\priv.edb >c:\edbdump.txt

-OR-

   ESEUTIL /MH c:\exchsrvr\mdbdata\pub.edb >c:\edbdump.txt

2. Edit the Edbdump.txt file and confirm that the state of the database is
   inconsistent.

3. If the database is inconsistent, run the following commands:

Versions 4.0 and 5.0
--------------------

   EDBUTIL /R /DS

Version 5.5
-----------

   ESEUTIL /R /DS

Use EDBUTIL /IS or ESEUTIL /IS to recover the Priv.edb and Pub.edb files. They
both use the same log files, so they will be recovered together.
