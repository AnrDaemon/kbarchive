TITLE   :BUG: Setup Does Not Validate First Three Digits of CD Key
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.0 4.1 4.2 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbVC500bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During installation of Visual C++, at the Registration dialog, setup will accept
any three characters entered for the first field of the CD Key. Setup will
continue and eventually brand a possibly incorrect CD Key into the "About
Developer Studio" dialog box of the installed product.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct an installation with an invalid CD Key, delete all files ending with
the .pkg extension in the \Msdev\Bin\Ide directory installed on the hard drive.
Then re-install Visual C++. At the Registration dialog, manually verify that the
first three digits of the CD Key are correct.

NOTE: You will have to re-install other components as well, such as Test,
Fortran, or MSDN.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The setup for this version of Visual C++ now correctly validates the second part
of the CD Key, the seven-digit serial field. Setup will not continue unless
these seven digits are entered correctly in the Registration dialog.

The CD Key for the product can be found on a yellow tag affixed inside the back
of the plastic CD case on the liner notes.
