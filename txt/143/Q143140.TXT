SUMMARY
=======

The Ipxroute.exe tool, included with Windows NT Server, provides the following
options:

1. The Ipxroute Config option displays the current IPX settings, including frame
   type, IPX network number, and internal network number, if one is configured.

2. The Ipxroute Table option displays the IPX routing table.

3. The Ipxroute Servers option displays the SAP table.

NOTE: The default setting is all server types. In the [/type=<xxxx>]
setting, <xxxx> refers to the server type.

4. The Ipxroute Stats option displays or clears IPX internal routing statistics.

NOTE: The [/Show] setting displays the internal routing table and the [/Clear]
setting clears the table.

These options provide information on RIP, SAP, and statistics. Use the Ipxroute
utility to display and modify information about the source routing tables used
by IPX.

MORE INFORMATION

IPX address, server type, and name.
