SUMMARY
=======

You may want to add frames and a path to an actor in a certain action pose, (see
"Using the SHIFT Key" below) or you may want to cycle through the actions
assigned to an actor to choose a particular pose (see "Using the CTRL Key"
below).

Using the SHIFT Key
-------------------

Once you have the actor in the position you want, hold the SHIFT key down on the
keyboard while continuing the path of the actor.

Using the CTRL Key
------------------

The control (CTRL) key allows you to cycle through the action sequence `in slow
motion to set the appropriate action.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adding frames with an actor resting, as opposed to moving, can also be
accomplished by holding down the left mouse button without moving the actor.
