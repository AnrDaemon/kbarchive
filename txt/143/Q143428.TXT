======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article corrects a documentation error for the SetWindowPos function call
as described in the Microsoft Visual Basic on-line help file (WIN31API.HLP) that
shipped with Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows. In Example 1 for
the hWnd property, if you run the code example, the following error message
displays:

   Bad DLL calling convention

MORE INFORMATION
================

The declaration is incorrectly documented as the following:

   Declare Sub SetWindowPos Lib "User" (ByVal h1 As Integer,
                                        ByVal h2 As Integer,
                                        ByVal x As Integer,
                                        ByVal y As Integer,
                                        ByVal cx As Integer,
                                        ByVal cy As Integer,
                                        ByVal f As Long)

The correct declaration is as follows:

   Declare Sub SetWindowPos Lib "User" (ByVal h1 As Integer,
                                        ByVal h2 As Integer,
                                        ByVal x As Integer,
                                        ByVal y As Integer,
                                        ByVal cx As Integer,
                                        ByVal cy As Integer,
                                        ByVal f As Integer)

NOTE: Each Declare statement must be entered as one, single line.

Please note that the last parameter (ByVal f As Long) is incorrectly defined as
Long. It should be defined as Integer.
