Page 61 of the Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 Concepts and Planning Guide states
the following:

   To create, share, stop sharing, and delete a ClipBook Viewer page,
   a user must be in one of the following groups on the computer:

      - Administrators
      - Server Operators
      - Power Users
      - Users

This statement is incorrect. Users cannot create new ClipBook pages. Users
can paste data into existing ClipBook pages when the creator (an
Administrator, Server Operator or Power User) of the page grants the user
permission.

Administrators, Server Operators and Power Users have the authority to
share directories on the network and create shared network objects. When
you, with only User permissions, attempt to create, share, stop sharing or
delete a ClipBook Viewer page, the following error message appears:

   You do not have sufficient privileges to perform this action.

This is by design.
