PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBKkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an unattended Setup of Windows NT 4.0, you may receive one of
the following messages:

 - Pre-installation completed successfully - press any key to shut down and
   reboot the system.

 - File system conversion complete.

When you receive one of these messages, the unattended Setup stops.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you use the following lines in your Unattend.txt
file:

   [Unattended]
   NoWaitAfterTextMode=1
   Filesystem=ConvertNTFS
   ExtendOemPartition=1

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Extract the Setupdd.sys file from the latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack or
   download the Setupdd.sys file from the following location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/
   hotfixes-postsp2/setupdd-fix

   For example, to extract all Service Pack files from Windows NT 4.0 Service
   Pack 3 to the current folder, type the following command at a command
   prompt:

   "Nt4sp3_i.exe /x" (without the quotation marks)

2. Copy the Setupdd.sys file to the folder from which you run Windows NT
   unattended Setup.

3. Edit the Unattend.txt file to add the "nowait" option to the end of the
   "ExtendOemPartition" line. For example, edit the Unattend.txt file so it
   includes the following lines:

   [Unattended]
   NoWaitAfterTextMode=1
   Filesystem=ConvertNTFS
   ExtendOemPartition=1, nowait

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem is corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the "ExtendOemPartition" option in Windows NT 4.0 unattended Setup, the
"OemPreinstall" option must be enabled. The "OemPreinstall" option was
originally designed to allow the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to stop
Windows NT Setup so the computer could be shipped to a customer at that point.
