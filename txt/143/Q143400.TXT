KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a form is run, either the form or controls on the form may exhibit
unexpected or inexplicable behavior.


CAUSE
=====

Some property settings in which the default value has been manually entered may
cause erratic behavior in certain forms. The exact properties or combination of
properties has not yet been determined.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine if this is the cause of unexplainable behavior, look for any
properties having the word "Default" within parenthesis which also appears in
bold. To correct this condition, right-click the bolded default property to
bring up the property menu. Then choose Reset to Default.
