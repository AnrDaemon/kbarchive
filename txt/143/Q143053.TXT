SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart your computer after installing Windows 95 or making a system
change that requires the computer to be restarted, you may receive the following
error message:

   While Initializing Device IOS: Windows Protection Error

Or, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault error message in Gui.exe.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the Mscmouse.com driver by Mouse Systems is being loaded
in the Autoexec.bat file, or if Gui.exe is being loaded from the "load=" line in
the Win.ini file.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the Mscmouse.com line in the Autoexec.bat file and then install the Mouse
Systems driver update available from the Mouse Systems BBS.

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the Win.ini file in the Windows
folder and remove the Gui.exe entry from the "load=" line. Save the Win.ini
file, close it, and then restart your computer.
