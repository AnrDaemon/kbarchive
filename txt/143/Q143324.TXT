======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q193970.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a Web in FrontPage Explorer, you receive the following
error message:

   HTTP error 404. The server may not have the FrontPage Server Extensions
   installed or may be misconfigured, you may have specified an invalid proxy
   server, or the Web you are accessing may have been deleted.

CAUSE
=====

You deleted your Web using File Manager or Windows Explorer rather than
FrontPage Explorer. When you click List Webs in the Open Web dialog box,
FrontPage Explorer retrieves the list of Webs from the Services.cnf file located
in the <x>:\<webroot>\_vti_pvt folder where <webroot> is the
location of the Web server's root content and <x> is the drive where the
Web server content resides. This file is updated when you delete your Web using
FrontPage Explorer; it is not updated when you use File Manager or Windows
Explorer to delete a Web.

RESOLUTION
==========

Method 1: Delete the Web
------------------------

To delete a Web, click Delete FrontPage Web on the File menu in FrontPage
Explorer.

You cannot delete a Web that you cannot open. To work around this situation,
create a folder using the same name as the deleted Web in the Content folder,
open the Web (it will be empty) in FrontPage Explorer, and then delete the Web.

Method 2: Edit the Services.cnf file
------------------------------------

Using a text editor, such as Notepad, edit the Services.cnf file in the
<x>:\<webroot>\_vti_pvt folder, where <webroot> is the
location of the Web server's root content and <x> is the drive where the
Web server content resides, and then remove the line that references the deleted
Web path.
