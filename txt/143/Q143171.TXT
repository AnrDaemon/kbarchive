SUMMARY
=======

When you perform an Unattended Setup of Windows NT 4.0, you are not given the
option either during or after Setup, to create an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD).
Use one of the following methods to create an Emergency Repair Disk:

Method 1: Have an ERD Created After Setup
-----------------------------------------

To have an Emergency Repair Disk created after Setup is complete, use these
steps:

1. Set up the following files in $oem$\d\temp:

         Rdisk.ini:
            \Registry\Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
            \RunOnce
            Run-Rdisk = rdisk.exe /s

         R-rdisk.bat:
            D:\Temp\Regini D:\Temp\Rdisk.ini
            del D:\Temp\Regini.exe
            del D:\Temp\Rdisk.ini
            del D:\Temp\R-Rdisk.bat

   The Regini.exe file is from the Resource Kit.

2. Add the following line to Cmdlines.txt:

   cmd /c d:\temp\r-rdisk.bat

   Substitute drive D: with the drive where you install Windows NT.

NOTE: This option causes a console window to appear during the GUI-mode of Setup
when the batch file is run. After your computer reboots, another Saving
Configuration message appears.

Method 2: Create a Shortcut
---------------------------

Add a shortcut to the desktop of the default user which starts "rdisk /s"
(without the quotation marks.)

Method 3: Create a Login Script
-------------------------------

Create a login script for your users that runs "rdisk /s" (without the quotation
marks) on a regular basis. This reminds users to keep their Emergency Repair
Disk current.

NOTE: An Emergency Repair Disk becomes increasingly more important as you make
changes to the system. The ERD created can, in most cases, be duplicated by
repeating Setup. Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
