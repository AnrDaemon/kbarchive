SUMMARY
=======

There are two ways to enable the Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me Style
Size Grip on the lower-right corner of a Microsoft Visual Basic Form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 95/98/Me Style Size Grip appears on certain forms and signals to the
user that the form is resizable.

There are two ways to enable the Size Grip icon to appear at the lower- right of
a Visual Basic Form.

 - The first way is to use the Status Bar Control, which is part of Windows
   Common Controls 6.0 (MSCOMCTL.OCX). This control positions itself at the
   bottom of the form and the size grip automatically appears on the right end
   of the control when the form is sizable.

 - The second way is to place a TextBox on the form so that the lower-right
   corner is always located on the lower-right corner of the form. You must then
   set the following properties for the TextBox in the Properties Window:

         Text1.Multiline = True
         Text1.Scrollbars = 3    'Both

The following code demonstrates using a text box in this way:

           Const x = 100       'where x and y are scaled values that you
           Const y = 385       'use to take into account the fact that
                               'the TextBox should be a little less wide
                               'and high than the form. You should
                               'initialize these to constant values.

           Private Sub Form_Load()
               Text1.Left = 0
               Text1.Top = 0
               Text1.Width = Me.Width - x
               Text1.Height = Me.Height - y
           End Sub

           Private Sub Form_Resize()
               Text1.Width = Me.Width - x
               Text1.Height = Me.Height - y
           End Sub
