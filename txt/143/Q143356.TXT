TITLE   :XCLN: Err Msg: The Logon Attempt Timed Out While Waiting
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select the Delivery tab in the Property dialog box for a Microsoft
Exchange 16-bit Windows client, the following error can occur:

   The logon attempt timed out while waiting for resources to become available
   Mapi 1.0 [00000a02]

WORKAROUND
==========

 - Open Control Panel and select the Mail And Fax icon. Click Show Profiles,
   then click Properties. Then, without logging on, double-click the Microsoft
   Exchange icon to bring up the Choose Profile dialog box.

   -or-

 - Complete the logon process held by the Choose Profile dialog box.

   -or-

 - Cancel the Choose Profile dialog box to free the logon mutex.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
4.0 16-bit Windows client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message occurs because of the action that selecting the Delivery tab
employs. "Delivery" is trying to log on while a logon mutex is held. A mutex is
a type of lock that prohibits other threads from attempting to execute the same
process. In the reverse case, the logon is completed before you attempt to do a
second logon so no error is generated.
