SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Start button and then click Help, you may receive the
following error message:

   Cannot display the help information. The file Winhelp.exe may be missing or
   damaged.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the Winhlp32.exe file in the Windows folder is missing
or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use Windows Explorer or My Computer to rename the Winhlp32.exe file, if it
   exists, in the Windows folder to Winhlp32.xxx.

2. Extract a new copy of the Winhlp32.exe file from your original Windows 95
   disks or CD-ROM to the Windows folder. For information about using the
   Extract tool, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:

3. Try to use Help again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Winhelp.exe file referred to in the error message is a 3K file in the
Windows folder. This file is used for compatibility with 16-bit Windows- based
programs. The Winhelp.exe file calls the Winhlp32.exe file to handle Help files.
The Winhelp.exe file is not actually required to run Help files, and it is
incorrectly referenced by the error message.
