TITLE   :IIS FTP Annotation Files Display One Line

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use FTP annotations in Microsoft Internet Information Server, some FTP
clients display only one line of the annotation file when you change to a new
directory. The full annotation file is displayed when you use the DIR or LS
commands.

NOTE: This only works with the command line FTP on one line. If you are using
Microsoft Internet Explorer for FTP, and using directory annotation, Internet
Explorer will give you the following error message:

   Internet explorer could not open site <address>

Netscape browser will not give an error, but it does not work.

This is a client/browser problem.

CAUSE
=====

The server sends the annotation file one line at a time. Some FTP clients do not
handle the multi-line message correctly. This is especially problematic when
using a web browser to connect to the FTP server.

WORKAROUND
==========

Reduce the annotation file to one line or disable FTP directory annotation. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q141705 : How to Set Up Directory Annotation for Internet Server FTP

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 1.0 We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
