The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Graph, Organization Chart, Equation Editor, or WordArt to insert an
object into a PowerPoint presentation, and you set the object's animation
settings to Build and Edit, you cannot activate the object for in-place editing
while running a slide show. Instead, PowerPoint opens the object in a separate
window.

CAUSE
=====

In PowerPoint, when you activate an OLE object to edit it, the toolbars and
menus change to those of the program that provided the OLE object. Therefore, if
you edit an embedded Word table, the PowerPoint menus and toolbars are
temporarily replaced by the Word menus and toolbars.

When you run a slide show, PowerPoint suppresses its menus and toolbars; they are
therefore not available to be replaced. The program responsible for editing the
OLE object opens its own window that can display menus and toolbars.
