TITLE   :Error Starting Mail Server in Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Mail Server (MailSrv) utility in Windows NT Resource Kit
version 3.51, the following error message appears:

   Error starting service smtpsrv
   Press OK to continue, or cancel to stop
   The data area passed to the system call is too small.

CAUSE
=====

The SMTPSrv service requires a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). A FQDN
consists of a Host name and a Domain name. When you install Windows NT Server
and the TCP/IP protocol, the computer name is entered as the Host name by
default. The Domain name is left blank.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Start Control Panel Network.

2. Select the TCP/IP Protocol and choose Configure.

3. Choose DNS and enter the Domain name.

   NOTE: Contact your network administrator for the exact domain name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mail Server is a Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office Protocol
versions 2 and 3 (POP2/POP3) server and implementation of the SendMail daemon
for Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server. The Mail Server installs many
services including SMTPSrv, which handles the receiving of SMTP mail. The
remaining services depend on SMTPSrv to start.
