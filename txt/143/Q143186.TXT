TITLE   :XADM: PerfMon Limited to 53 MTA Instances
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Only 53 Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) can be viewed in the
Windows NT Performance Monitor (PerfMon).

CAUSE
=====

The MTA service limits the number of MTA PerfMon instances to 53 by default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The number of MTA PerfMon instances can be viewed by starting PerfMon, clicking
the Edit menu, clicking Add to Chart, clicking MSExchangeMTA Connections in the
Object drop down box, and then viewing the Instances list box. The maximum
number of instances viewable by default is 53 and this includes other MTAs,
MDBs, and gateways.

The number of instances is calculated using the LAN-MTAs registry parameter
under:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      System
         CurrentControlSet
            Services
               MSExchangeMTA
                  Parameters

If the LAN-MTAs parameter is set to a value less than 53, there will be a maximum
number of 53 instances viewable.

Microsoft Exchange Servers that are exhibiting many MTA 9406 and 9407 event ID's
might need to have this value increased.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
