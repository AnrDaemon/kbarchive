TITLE   :PPT7: After Build Step Fails in Slide Show
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run your presentation in slide show view, some of the objects in your
presentation (text boxes, pictures, drawing objects) may be built incorrectly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when the animation settings for the object includes the
following:

 - The "Start When Previous Build Ends" check box is selected (under "Build
   Options"

 - A setting is selected in the "After Build Step" drop-down box

If you use these two options with the same object, the After Build Step will
fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one or the other of these options. That is, if you want to use the the
"After Build Step" option, clear the "Start When Previous Build Ends" check box
(under Build Options).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint version 7.0 for
Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
