PRODUCT :Word Front Page

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 2000 version of this article, see Q205479.

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194328.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running the FrontPage Personal Web Server and you browse a FrontPage
Web site, you may see a list of files in the Web's directory instead of the home
page.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the FrontPage Personal Web Server looks for a home
page with a name specified in the Srm.cnf file in the server's \conf directory.
A page with this name must reside in the default Web folder when using the
FrontPage Personal Web server. In FrontPage 1.1 and 97 this folder is typically
C:\FrontPage Webs\Content. In FrontPage 1.0, this folder is typically
C:\Content.

The default home page for the FrontPage Personal Web Server is Index.htm.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior, you may either rename your home page to Index.htm or
reconfigure the FrontPage Personal Web Server to serve the home page name of
your choosing.

If you choose to rename your home page, you may need to correct any links in the
Web that point back to the home page. If you are using FrontPage 1.1 and 97, you
will be prompted to automatically update incoming links.

If you choose to reconfigure the FrontPage Personal Web Server to serve the home
page name of your choosing, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q150681 FP: How to Use a Document Other Than Index.htm as Default Page

NOTE: Other Web servers, use different default home page file names, such as
Index.html, Welcome.htm, Welcome.html, Default.htm, or Default.html.
