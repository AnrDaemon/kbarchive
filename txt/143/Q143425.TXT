PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the RichTextBox control and attempting to load a text file that
contains a blank line as the first line, or, assigning a file, which contains a
blank line as the first line, to the FileName property of the RichTextBox
control, you will receive an error (32002):

   Cannot load binary data or files containing binary data

CAUSE
=====

The RichTextBox control scans the file and examines the first 5 characters. This
error is generated if any of the first 5 characters have an ANSI value less than
25 or greater than 250.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround the problem, import the file into any text editor (MS-DOS Edit,
Notepad or WordPad) and add 5 blank spaces on the first line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in the Visual
Basic version 4.0a for Windows synchronization release. This problem has also
been corrected in Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0.
