TITLE   :NetWare Clients Cannot Connect to FPNW Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you install File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) on your computer
running Windows NT, if NetWare clients are not able to connect to the FPNW
server, check to see if FPNW was installed in the absence of a NetWare server.
If so, then the resulting Network Number of all zeros is not valid.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install FPNW it will automatically detect any network numbers that are
being used (see page 3 in the Windows NT FPNW Administrators Guide). It will
then assign itself a number based on what it detects. If there are no network
numbers assigned or FPNW does not detect any (that is, no NetWare servers are
running), it will assign itself a number of all zeros. In the absence of any
NetWare Servers this is not a valid number and NetWare clients will not be able
to connect to the FPNW server.

With NetWare Netx clients, the error received is "No Free Connection Slots
Available".

To change the network number from all zeros to a valid network number:

1. Run Control Panel and choose Network.

2. Select NWLink and choose Configure.

3. Do one of the following:

    - Set the frame type and the network number:

      a. If you know the frame type used on your network, set the frame type
         from Auto to your network frame, otherwise leave it at Auto.

         NOTE: Changing Auto to the specific frame type speeds up frame
         processing because it eliminates the frame type detection process.

      b. If you have a NetWare server on your network, specify the network
         number used by that server and all NetWare workstations. If you do not
         have a NetWare server on your network specify a network number
         containing any combination of the letters A-F and numbers 0-9,
         excluding all Fs or all 0s (zeros).

-or-

    - Change the Internal Network number to a number that is unique on your
      network and not used by any other computer. That number may contain any
      combination of the letters A-F and numbers 0-9, excluding all Fs or all 0s
      (zeros).
