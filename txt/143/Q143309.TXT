TITLE   :FIX: Report Writer Ignores Constant Band Height Setting
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Report Writer ignores the Constant Band Height setting of the Detail band
when "Remove Line If Blank" is selected for the expressions in a single-column
report and there are blank fields in the record source table.

WORKAROUND
==========

For more information about preserving constant band height when some fields are
empty in a single column report, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q143063 How to Remove White Lines in Mailing Labels and Reports


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Using the Report Writer, create a single column report based on the Customer
   table located in the Samples\Data subdirectory.

2. Place the following fields in the Detail band of the report:

      cust_id
      city
      region
      country
      phone
      fax

3. Double-click each expression in the Detail band. Then choose the Print When
   button, and select "Remove Line If Blank."

4. Double-click the Detail band itself, and check "Constant Band Height."

5. Preview the report and look at the record for Cust_id = "ANTON". Notice that
   the fax number is missing. "Remove Line If Blank" worked; and "Constant Band
   Height" did not have any effect.
