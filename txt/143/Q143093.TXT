MORE INFORMATION
================

FrontPage TCP/IP Test
---------------------

The TCP/IP Test utility tests for a properly installed version of Windows
sockets, the IP address, and the host name (if any) of your computer. The
FrontPage TCP/IP test also verifies the local loopback address (127.0.0.1) and
localhost, the standard loopback host name.

FrontPage 97:

To run the TCP/IP test utility, follow these steps:

1. Start FrontPage Explorer.

2. On the Help menu, click About Microsoft FrontPage Explorer.

3. In the About FrontPage Explorer dialog box, click Network Test.

4. In the TCP/IP Test dialog box, click Start Test.

FrontPage 1.1:

To run the TCP/IP test utility, follow these steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Microsoft FrontPage,
   and then click TCP/IP Test.

2. In the TCP/IP Test dialog box, click Start Test.

Server Administrator
--------------------

Use the Server Administrator to check for properly installed server extensions,
the server type, the server port, the server content area, and the server
configuration file if the server has one. It is recommended that you uninstall
and then reinstall the extensions if the content area or configuration file has
changed.

The Server Administrator also allows you to enable or disable authoring on a
selected port. The Server Administrator also allows you to add user names and
passwords to a list of administrators on all servers except Microsoft Internet
Information Server.

The icon you use to start the FrontPage Server Administrator is in different
locations depending on the version of FrontPage and the version of Windows you
are running.

All versions of FrontPage Running on Windows NT 3.51:

The icon is located in the program group for Microsoft FrontPage. This is also
true for FrontPage 1.0 on Windows 3.x.

FrontPage 97 Running on Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0:

The icon is located in the directory where you installed FrontPage. By default,
this location is C:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage.

FrontPage 1.1 Running on Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0:

On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Microsoft FrontPage, and
then click FrontPage Server Administrator.

Check Installation Utility (FrontPage 1.0 Only)
-----------------------------------------------

The Check Installation utility is a component of FrontPage 1.0 only. It is not
available for later versions of FrontPage. The Check Installation utility
examines your system to ensure that the system dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)
necessary to run FrontPage are installed correctly. The results are displayed in
a window and are written to the Chkver.log file in the Bin folder within the
FrontPage Root. The default FrontPage Root for version 1.0 is c:\Vermeer.
