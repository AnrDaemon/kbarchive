======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Haunted House for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start The Ultimate Haunted House on a Windows 3.1x- based
computer, you may receive a "General Protection Fault" error message.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your display adapter is based on a Cirrus Logic chip
set and you need to update the video drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change your Windows 3.1x video driver to Super VGA (256
colors). For information about how to change your video driver, please see your
printed Windows documentation or on-line Help file.

The Super VGA (256 colors) video driver is included with version 3.11 of
Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Windows for Workgroups. If you have version 3.1
of Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you may need to download and install the
Super VGA drivers (Svga.exe) from the Microsoft Software Library. The Svga.exe
file is available as a free download from the following Microsoft Internet
sites:

   http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/svga.exe

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/svga.exe

MORE INFORMATION
================

Versions 1.32 and 1.4 of the Cirrus Logic video display drivers work well with
The Ultimate Haunted House. Version 1.43 of the Cirrus Logic video driver may be
incompatible with The Ultimate Haunted House.
