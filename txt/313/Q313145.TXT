======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to enter a Domain Name System (DNS) name in the COM Transaction
Integrator (COMTI) Manager, you discover that COMTI Manager does not support the
use of DNS names. Instead, COMTI Manager requires a numeric IP address on the
TCP/IP tab of the Remote Environment properties.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

In SNA Server 4.0, no change has been made to the product to allow you to enter a
DNS name.

Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------
