SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to replace a dynamic-link library (DLL) with its
checked version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The checked version of a DLL contains debug statements that are removed in the
release version of a DLL. You can use these debug statements to isolate a
problem in the DLL while you are debugging.

To replace a DLL with its checked version, follow these steps:

1. Check whether the DLL that the Technical Support personnel sent is the
   compressed version or the expanded version.

2. If the DLL is the expanded version, you can use the DLL as is.

   If the DLL is the compressed version, use the Resource Kit utility
   (Expand.exe) to uncompress the DLL. Type the following command at a command
   prompt:

   "expand.exe <compressed dllname> <expanded name>" (without the
   quotation marks)

3. Log on to the system in safe mode to work around the Microsoft Windows 2000
   File Protection feature.

4. Rename the existent DLL.

5. Copy the checked version of the DLL to the same folder. You can obtain the
   checked version of a DLL from Microsoft Technical Support. For more
   information, refer to the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx

6. Reboot the system in normal mode.
