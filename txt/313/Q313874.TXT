TITLE   :SMSINST: SMS Installer Does Not Overwrite Identical Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SMS Installer may not overwrite a file as you instruct it to if the same file
exists on a client computer.

CAUSE
=====

To alleviate excessive network traffic, a binary comparison is performed instead
of simply overwriting the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS Installer performs a binary comparison of the files that are to be replaced.
SMS Installer does not replace files that are identical on the client, even if
you choose always to overwrite in the script. This decision was made based on
the network traffic that occurs when identical files are copied. The binary
comparison ensures that files are skipped only if they are identical on the
client.

If the cyclical redundancy check (CRC) determines that the files are exactly the
same, the file is skipped. This cuts down on network traffic and essentially
allows installations to continue where they left off after interrupted
installations. The end result is exactly the same as in the previous version of
SMS Installer in all cases. The only difference is in the text in the log files.
