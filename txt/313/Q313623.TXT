TITLE   :FIX: Menus Display in English on Spanish-Language OS
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700 _IK283

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Spanish version of Visual FoxPro 7.0 on a computer running a
multi-language Windows operating system (OS), such as Microsoft Windows 2000 or
Microsoft Windows XP, and the language settings for the OS are set to any
language other than Spanish(Spain) (Espanol(Espana)), the Visual FoxPro 7.0
menus appear in English instead of Spanish.

CAUSE
=====

When Visual FoxPro loads, it checks with the OS to determine which resource file
to load. If the OS returns any language setting other than "ESN"
(Spanish(Spain)), Visual FoxPro defaults to the English resource file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

Although Microsoft recommends that you apply Visual FoxPro 7.0 Service Pack 1
(SP1), you can work around this problem by doing one of the following:

 - Set the regional options for the OS to Spanish(Spain).

 - Use the -l command-line switch to specify the Spanish resource file. Be sure
   not to leave a space after the "l". For example, create a shortcut with a
   command line such as the following:

   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual FoxPro\VFP7.exe" -lvfp7esn.dll

 - Delete or rename all of the Visual FoxPro 7.0 resource files (Vfp7xxx.dll)
   except Vfp7esn.dll. This forces Visual FoxPro 7.0 to load the correct
   resource file by default.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
