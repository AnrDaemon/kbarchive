SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft SQL Server 2000 supports multiple instances of the SQL Server database
engine that run concurrently on the same computer. The following are the two
types of SQL Server database engine instances: default and named. There can only
be one default instance that runs on any computer, and it is identified by the
name of the computer on which the default instance runs. The computer name and
instance name are typically specified in the following format:

computer_name\instance_name

To connect to a named instance through the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Driver for
JDBC, you must specify the port number that is associated with the named
instance, instead of the name of the named instance as shown earlier.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find the SQL Server instance port number, follow these steps:

1. On the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 server, start the SQL Server Network
   Utility.

2. Click the General tab, and then click the instance you want from the
   Instances drop-down menu.

3. Click TCP/IP, and then click Properties. Note that the port number for this
   instance appears in the Properties dialog box.

As soon as you have this value, you can use it in your connection URL when you
connect to SQL Server through JDBC. The following is an example of a typical
connection URL:

   jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://<yourServerName>:1433;user=<yourUser>;password=<yourPwd>

In this example, the default port of 1433 is used. Replace this default with the
port number for your named instance.
