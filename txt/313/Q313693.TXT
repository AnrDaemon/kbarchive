TITLE   :3270 Client (Win3270.exe) Doesn't Enforce User/Group Assignments
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The 3270 client (Win3270.exe) allows a user to open multiple 3270 sessions even
though only a single instance of a 3270 logical Unit (LU) pool is assigned to
the user/group record in the Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 configuration.

CAUSE
=====

The 3270 client was not updated to enforce user/group assignments after it was
enhanced to support multiple 3270 sessions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a single instance of a 3270 LU pool is assigned to a user or group, the user
should be restricted to opening a single 3270 session. To grant access to
multiple pooled 3270 sessions, an HIS 2000 administrator can assign multiple
instances of the 3270 LU pool to the user or group.

This problem has been observed with some third-party emulators, as described in
the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
