SUMMARY
=======

The name of a user in the form of user@domain.com is known as the user principal
name (UPN). This step-by-step article describes how to allow UPN logon for the
Microsoft File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service.

 Enable UPN Logon for FTP Using IIS 5.0
--------------------------------------

Note that you can only enable UPN logon for FTP in a Windows 2000 domain
environment. That is, you must have Active Directory running, and the user must
be in a domain account in that directory.

Before you begin, verify that you are not experiencing the problem that is
described in the following Knowledge Base article, and request the hotfix in the
article if necessary:

   Q299273 UPN Logon Option Does Not Work After You Apply Fix from MS01-026
   Security Bulletin

You can use either the Adsutil.vbs utility or the Mdutil.exe utility to allow UPN
logon for the FTP service.

Enable UPN Logon for FTP with Adsutil.vbs:

To use the Adsutil.vbs file to enable UPN logon for FTP, you must add the
DefaultLogonDomain entry to the FTP service properties in the metabase and set
the value to the backslash character (\). For additional information on how to
do this, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Enable UPN Logon for FTP with Mdutil.exe:

To enable UPN logon for all local FTP sites, type the following at a command
prompt:

   mdutil.exe set msftpsvc/DefaultLogonDomain \

To enable UPN logon for the first FTP site, type the following at a command
prompt:

   mdutil.exe set msftpsvc/1/DefaultLogonDomain \

NOTE: You cannot enable UPN logon for FTP by setting a backslash (\) for the
root, as follows:

   mdutil set /msftpsvc/1/root/DefaultLogonDomain \

For more information on Mdutil.exe, see the following Knowledge Base article:
