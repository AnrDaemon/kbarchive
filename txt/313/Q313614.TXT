-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select the Query node in the SMS Administrator console, the console may
appear to stop responding (hang) before all of the available queries are
displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur after you apply Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
Service Pack 4 (SP4). Changes in SMS 2.0 SP4 were made to prevent duplicate
queries from appearing in the SMS Administrator console as described in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
