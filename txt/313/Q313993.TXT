the 4 KB limit is truncated in the Visual SourceSafe (VSS) database. The stored
procedure is never truncated in the SQL Server database.

RESOLUTION

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
it has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to computers

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This hotfix also resolves the issue in which SQL Server consumes 100 percent of
the resources of the CPU and adds new stored procedures to the source control,
as well as the issue in which source control icons do not appear in Visual
InterDev.
