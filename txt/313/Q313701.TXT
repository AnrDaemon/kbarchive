TITLE   :Logon Manager Does Not Appear When Outlook Express is Launched A
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network Version 5.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Logon Manager does not appear when Outlook Express is launched after MSN 5.6
automatic upgrade.

CAUSE
=====

After an automatic upgrade to MSN version 5.6, Outlook Express will not launch
Logon Manager--whether you start Outlook Express from the desktop or from the
Program Files menu. Instead, a prompt appears asking what connection you would
like to dial with. The only option is Don't dial a connection. This is a known
issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Outlook Express has not been configured correctly before the forced upgrade
to MSN 5.6, then Logon Manager will not launch when you start Outlook Express.
Please check to make sure your e-mail security settings are correct. See
