KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbvfp kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700 _IK283

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot obtain the product ID from the Help About dialog box or from Visual
FoxPro (VFP) language functions.

CAUSE
=====

The Spanish version of Visual FoxPro 7.0 does not write the product ID into the
Windows registry. The setup routine that installs the Spanish version sets the
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\VisualFoxPro\7.0\Registration\ProductID value to "".

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install the Spanish version of VFP 7.0 on any operating system. The operating
   system can be any language version.

2. From the System menu, click Help, and then click About Microsoft Visual
   FoxPro. Note that the Product ID field is blank.

Because the registry key mentioned in the "Cause" section contains "", SYS(9) and
VERSION(1) return nothing.
