The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2002, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the Researcher in Microsoft Encarta Reference Library
2002, you may receive an error message similar to the following:

   The page cannot be displayed.

   There is a problem with the page you are trying to reach and it cannot be
   displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if Encarta Reference Library is damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please consult your product
documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.

2. Click "Add or Remove Programs".

3. In the list of currently installed programs, click "Microsoft Encarta
   Reference Library 2002", and then click Remove.

4. Start Windows Explorer, and then browse to the folder where Encarta is
   installed (for example, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Encarta).

5. Delete the Microsoft Encarta folder and the FactFinder folder.

6. Use a clean boot to restart your computer.

   NOTE: A clean boot is a way to create a clean environment. When you start your
   computer with a clean boot, Microsoft Windows starts and loads only basic
   devices and services. For information about how to use a clean boot and how
   to use a normal startup, see the "More Information" section later in this
   article.

7. Reinstall Encarta Reference Library.

8. Use a normal startup to restart Windows.
