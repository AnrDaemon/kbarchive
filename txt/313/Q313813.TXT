KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a site that is hosted on Internet Information Server
(IIS) 5.0 through the HTTPS protocol, and the Web server is configured to use a
Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) server certificate, you may receive the
following error message:

   The page cannot be displayed.


CAUSE
=====

The SGC certificate is missing the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.3 (Microsoft Server
Gated Crypto) entry in the Extended Key Usage extension field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, request a new SGC certificate that has the following
entries in the Extended Key Usage extension field:

 - 2.16.840.1.113730.4.1 (the OID for Netscape SGC)

 - 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.3 (the OID for Microsoft SGC)

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
