TITLE   :SMS: Duplicate Query Names Possible When You Rename a Query
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbui kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Systems Management Server (SMS) administrator console, when you edit a
query that has been previously defined, it is possible to change the query name.
If you change the query name to match the name of a query that already exists,
the SMS administrator console accepts the change, and the result is two queries
with the same name. When you initially build a query, it is not possible to
choose a name that already exists. This problem occurs only when you edit a
query and change its name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, ensure that the name you choose for a query is
unique.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are no known side effects of this problem except that when you select a
query to use in collection rules, you see two queries with the same name. This
makes it difficult to determine which query you need to use.

Additional query words: prodsms
