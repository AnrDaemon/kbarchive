Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE Project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click Components.

3. Click to select the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog control 6.0 check box, and then
   click OK.

4. Add a Tabbed Dialog Control (SSTab1) to Form1.

5. Add a Textbox control to Tab0.

6. Add a Textbox and Label control to Tab1.

7. Paste the following code in the General Declarations section of Form1:

   Private Sub Text1_Validate(Cancel As Boolean)
      Debug.Print "Text1_Validate"
   End Sub

   Private Sub Text2_Validate(Cancel As Boolean)
      Debug.Print "Text2_Validate"
   End Sub

8. Press the F5 key to start the project.

9. Click Text1 on Tab0.

10. Click Tab1. The Validate event for Text1 should fire, but it does not.

11. Click Text2 on Tab1.

12. Click Tab0. The Validate event for Text2 should fire, but it does not.

NOTE: If you place the Label and Textbox control on Tab1 inside of a Frame
control, the Validate event for both text boxes fires.
