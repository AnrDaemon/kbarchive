KEYWORDS:kbCOMIS kbWin2000PreSP3Fix kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 HTTP client sends a
Content-Range header or a Content-Type header to IIS, it is possible that when
IIS adds its Content-Range header, it may improperly place the header in the
body of the HTTP response.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior only occurs if the outgoing headers were modified by an IIS ISAPI
filter, which may occur if, for example, you use the IIS security tool, URLscan,
to remove the "Server:" header.
