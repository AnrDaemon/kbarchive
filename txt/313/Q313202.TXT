======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) or Common Programming
Interface for Communications (CPI-C) applications that are configured to use the
Single Sign-On (SSO) feature may fail to connect to a host system if the FMH-5
(function management header) Attach message does not contain one or more of the
following subfields:

 - Logical Unit of Work Identifier (LUWID) subfield

 - Conversation Correlator field

 - Password subfield (a subfield in the Access Security Information subfield,
   which also ordinarily includes a User ID subfield)

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe) fails to correctly parse short FMH-5
Attach messages. The FMH-5 Attach messages are short because they lack one or
more subfields.

RESOLUTION
==========

STATUS
======

SNA Server 4.0

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0, 4.0
Service Pack (SP) 1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, and 4.0 SP4.

Host Integration Server 2000

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are configuration settings that result in an FMH-5 Attach message
that does not include one or more of the necessary fields:

 - If the APPC or CPI-C application is running on an SNA Server 4.0 client or
   SNA Server 4.0 system that is configured with registry entry "LUWIDSUP=NO",
   the APPC dynamic link library (DLL) will not ask the SNA Server service to
   generate an LUWID. The resulting FMH-5 Attach message will not include the
   Logical Unit of Work Identifier subfield.

 - If an APPC or CPI-C application is designed to use a security type of AP_SAME
   or CM_SECURITY_SAME, the FMH-5 Attach message may not include the password
   subfield as part of the Access Security Information subfield.

For more information on these and other fields and parameters that are included
in FMH-5 Attach messages, see "FM Headers" in the IBM SNA Formats guide
(GA27-3136).
