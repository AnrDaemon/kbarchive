======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers with an EISA bus that use SysKonnect FDDI network adapters may
experience data corruption during some DMA write operations.

CAUSE
=====

SysKonnect has confirmed that a problem exists in the application-specific
intergrated circuit (ASIC) on their FDDI network adapters with model numbers
SK-53xx. The problem occurs only if the Bclock signal on the EISA bus is
extended beyond 800nS. This condition is known to occur on the following Compaq
systems:

   SystemPro XL
   ProLiant 2000
   ProLiant 4000
   ProLiant 4500

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, please contact SysKonnect technical support for an ASIC
revision. In addition to this hardware update, an enhanced Windows NT driver is
available from SysKonnect.
