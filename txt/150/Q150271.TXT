TITLE   :Duplicate Name on the Network error message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A DHCP client receives a "Duplicate name on the network" error message when
logging on to the network.

Also, the Enable IP Routing check box in the TCP/IP properties of the Network
Control Panel tool is checked, but is unavailable and cannot be cleared.

CAUSE
=====

If Remote Access Service (RAS) has been installed, in addition to another
network protocol, and then removed or disabled, the registry entries may not be
automatically removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. If RAS is still installed, remove it using the Network Control Panel tool,
   under Installed Network Software.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:

   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \Tcpip\Parameters

3. Change the 'EnableIpRouting' value to 0.

4. Restart the computer.

The computer will now only request an IP address for the installed network
interface.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
