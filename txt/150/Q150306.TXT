======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Bookshelf using the Minimal installation option, Bookshelf runs
from the compact disc, resulting in slower performance than the Typical
installation. This is normal behavior. So to increase performance, you then run
Bookshelf Setup again. The Add/Remove includes the following text:

   Microsoft Bookshelf application files: Selecting this option will install the
   application and the necessary system files, otherwise only the necessary
   system files will be installed on the hard drive, and the application will
   run from CD.

However, after you install the files to the hard drive, Bookshelf continues to
run from compact disc and performance is not increased.

NOTE: These Setup options are only available if you start the Bookshelf Setup
from the CD-ROM drive root folder. They are not available if you use the AutoRun
feature.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Bookshelf '96-'97 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Run Bookshelf Setup.

2. Choose the Remove All option.

3. Run Bookshelf Setup again, and perform a Typical Installation.

   NOTE: You can choose a Custom installation if you select the Bookshelf Files
   option.

After you remove and reinstall the program, Bookshelf will run from the hard
drive.
