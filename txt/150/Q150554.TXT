The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

After you install a Thomas Conrad TC4145 Token Ring adapter on a computer
running Windows NT, the following error is returned:

   The TCC Token Ring Driver service failed to start due to the following
   error:
   The device attached to the system is not functioning.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs when you use the driver supplied by Thomas Conrad with the
TC4145. This is a Plug and Play (PnP) adapter, and PnP must be turned off before
the driver will work properly in Windows NT. Use the QSET4145 utility supplied
with the adapter--specifically, the -B=D -T=1 switches. This will turn off the
PnP boot active and the PnP functionality.
