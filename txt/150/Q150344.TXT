SUMMARY
=======

In Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean, there are seven games, each associated
with different zones of the ocean. The games can be accessed in the back of the
bus from the game box in the lower-right area of the screen, just above the
porthole.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The game icon that appears in the game box defaults to the game for the current
zone, but the game can be changed based on the positions of the three levers to
the right of the game box.

The three levers (with round white handles) can be positioned up and down for a
total of eight possible lever combinations. Each of seven of the combinations
correspond to a different game, and there is one combination that corresponds to
the credits screen.
