SUMMARY
=======

This article lists some configuration settings for Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh version 3.0b.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Macscreen
---------

This setting controls whether the Visual FoxPro desktop is visible at startup. To
prevent the desktop screen from appearing at startup, use the following setting
in the Config.fpm file:

      MACSCREEN=OFF

Macdesktop
----------

Controls whether windows reside at the same level as the main FoxPro for
Macintosh window. When Macdesktop is set to OFF, windows reside on the main
FoxPro for Macintosh window. They cannot be moved outside the main FoxPro for
Macintosh window, and behave in the same manner as windows in Visual FoxPro for
Windows. This setting is useful when developing cross platform applications.

Keycomp
-------

This setting controls the Visual FoxPro keystroke navigation. In FoxPro for
Macintosh, you can specify the DOS, WINDOWS, or MAC (default) option. For more
information about the keystrokes that the Keycomp setting controls, search for
SET KEYCOMP in the online Help.

Title
-----

This setting changes the title of the main Visual FoxPro window. You can use it
in a executable (.EXE) file to control the name of the main window.

A sample configuration file is as follows:

      ******Sample Config.Fpm

         MACSCREEN=OFF
         TITLE=My Exe File
         MACDESKTOP=OFF
         DEFAULT="Macintosh HD:My Exe File"
         KEYCOMP= Mac
