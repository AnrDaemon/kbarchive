TITLE   :No Domain Validation with EtherExpres Pro and Docking Station II
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an IBM Docking Station II and an Intel EtherExpress Pro Ethernet
network card, computers running Microsoft Windows 95 cannot log on to the
network and be validated by a domain controller. Running SoftSet, its diagnostic
and setup program, the Loopback test will fail.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is with the amount of electromagnetic interference (EMI) inside the
Docking Station II. Under these conditions, the EtherExpress Pro will fail to
operate correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, change the setting, Force 8 Bit Operation, to True.
This slows the card down by making it use 8-bit data transfers instead of
16-bit. This slower transmission rate is sustainable even with the high amounts
of EMI. In addition, IBM has released a driver which alters the bus timing and
is reported to help ISA cards work in these docking stations.

Microsoft has not tested this driver and makes no claims about its
effectiveness.
