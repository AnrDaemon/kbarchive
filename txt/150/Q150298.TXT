======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may need to change the computer name of a primary domain
controller (PDC) or a backup domain controller (BDC). To do this, follow
the steps below.

To Rename a Primary Domain Controller
-------------------------------------

1. On Windows NT 3.x computers, from the console of the PDC, go to Control Panel
   Network.

   On Windows NT 4.0 computers, from the console of the PDC, go to Control Panel
   Network and click the Identification tab.

   In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the Change button next to the
   computer name. Type the new name in the Computer Name dialog box and choose
   OK.

2. Restart the PDC for the name change to take effect.

3. In Server Manager, if the old name still appears as a Backup, or if there is
   no entry for the new name:

   a. Create an entry for the new name. To do this, select Add to Domain in the
      Computer menu of Server Manager.

   b. Add the new computer account as a "Windows NT Backup Domain Controller"
      (it will be added and displayed as a Primary).

   c. Remove the old name by selecting the entry. To do this, select Remove from
      Domain on the Computer menu.

   NOTE: In some cases, Step 3a may create two accounts for the new computer
   name: one as a backup and the other as a primary. If this occurs, remove the
   Backup as described above.

To Rename a Backup Domain Controller
------------------------------------

1. In Server Manager, select the domain to which you are adding the new computer
   name. Then add the new computer name. Make sure to specify that it will be a
   backup domain controller.

2. On the BDC that you are changing the name of, go to Control Panel Network. In
   the Network Settings dialog box, click the Change button next to the computer
   name. Type the new computer name in the Computer Name dialog box and choose
   OK.

3. Restart the BDC for which you have changed the name. Note that the NETLOGON
   service will not yet start on this server.

4. On any other computer that is a member of the domain, open Server Manager.
   Select the new BDC name and from the Computer menu, choose Synchronize With
   Primary. This will start the NETLOGON service.

5. In Server Manager, select the old BDC name from the list and from the
   Computer menu, choose Remove From Domain.

Note:  If the BDC begins to receive 7023 or 3210 errors after synching the
domain in server manager, on the PDC choose the BDC and then synch that
specific BDC with the PDC.  After an event indicating that the synch is
complete, restart the BDC.
