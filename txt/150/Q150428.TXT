 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you work with Microsoft Bookshelf, temporary files appear in your
Bookshelf 1996-97 folder on the hard drive. These files are named "Do" and "oc,"
and may begin with a symbol character.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Find function in Bookshelf, the program creates temporary files
that it uses as part of the Find process. It is normal to have these files.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you quit Microsoft Bookshelf, the temporary files should be deleted
automatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the files are not deleted automatically, it should not pose a problem.
However, if you wish to remove them manually, do the following:

1. On the Special menu, click Restart.

2. After the machine restarts, you may drag the temporary files to the Trash and
   then empty the Trash. This deletes the files.
