TITLE   :Redirector Doesn't Close the Session After User Logs Off
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On Windows NT, it is possible for multiple logon sessions to be in progress
simultaneously from a single workstation to a single server, for example an
interactive logon session initiated by the interactive logon user and another
session initiated by a service. These logon sessions are multiplexed over a
single virtual circuit (VC). If a resource is kept open by the noninteractive
session on the server, the server will keep open the session for the interactive
user even after the user has logged off from the workstation.

CAUSE
=====

When a user logs off, the Rdr.sys checks to see if there is any open resource
for that user. Rdr.sys will close any resources that are open with the session
ID of the currently logged on user and then send a logoff request to the server;
the server will then close the session. However, if a resource is open on a
noninteractive session, Rdr.sys will close the resources open by the interactive
user but will not send a logoff request to the server. As a result, the session
will be kept open for the user on the server even after the user has logged off.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======
