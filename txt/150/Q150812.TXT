SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Octopus driver with a Windows NT server, the following stop
error message appears:

   STOP: 0x00000050 (0xff162000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
   PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA

Note: The first parameter may differ, depending upon the computer's
configuration, but the first three hexidecimal digits should be same for each
stop thereafter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The computer stops responding after the Octopus kernel mode driver requests
Windows NT to write to the Octopus log file with an invalid length parameter.

Octopus has developed a fix for this problem.

Users with version 1.5 should have build 1.5H or later. The driver should be
dated 5-15-96 or later.

Users with version 1.6 should have version build 147a or later. The Driver should
be dated 3-26-96 or later.
