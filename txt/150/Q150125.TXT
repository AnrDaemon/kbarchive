TITLE   :BUG: Write of Function Returning a Character String Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you declare a function that returns a variable size array of variable
length character strings by putting the array declaration part before the string
declaration part, a write of the array-valued function fails to produce correct
results.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reorder the declaration by specifying the string declaration part before the
array declaration part.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code causes the write of the array to print nothing.
Changing the declaration, so the string is declared before the array, causes the
correct output 1 to be written to the display.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem
---------------------------------

   ! Compile options needed: none

         program test
           interface
             function h(i,j)
   ! comment the following two lines for workaround
               dimension h(i)
               character(len=j) h
   ! uncomment the following two lines for workaround
   !            character(len=j) h
   !            dimension h(i)
             end function
           end interface

           write(*,*) h(1,1)
         end program test

         function h(i,j)
   ! comment the following two lines for workaround
           dimension h(i)
           character(len=j) h
   ! uncomment the following two lines for workaround
   !        character(len=j) h
   !        dimension h(i)
           h = '1234567890'
         end function
