TITLE   :PRB: Sizeof Constant Character Returns Different Values

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The sizeof('x') or sizeof(L'x') constants do not return expected results. In C,
the return value is 4 for the sizeof character constant and 2 for the sizeof
multicharacter constant. In C++, the return value is 1 for the sizeof character
constant and 2 for the sizeof multicharacter constant.

CAUSE
=====

The specification on this point is different for C from what it is for C++. In
C, a character constant is of type int. In C++, a character constant is of type
char. Multicharacter constants are implementation dependent.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using C, do not use sizeof to determine the width of a character constant.
Use sizeof("") to give the width of one character in both C and C++.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
