PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Batch Setup (Batch.exe) version 2.0 tool included with
Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1, extra commas may appear at the end of the
"Services=" line in the [Network] section of your custom Setup script.

Note that in some cases, the extra commas cause a Select Device dialog box to
appear during Setup, prompting the user to select a network service from a list
of manufacturers.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is enabled on the Available Clients
tab in the network options, and specific settings for the Preferred Tree or Name
Context have been entered for the NetWare Directory Service settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to remove the extra commas from the end of
the "Services=" line in the [Network] section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, extra commas do not impact an automated Setup. If a custom Setup
script contains extra commas in the "Services=" line, however, a prompt appears
during Setup.
