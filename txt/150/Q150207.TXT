TITLE   :FIX: Error Message on Property Page of ImageList Reappears
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp400bug kbVBp500fix kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the navigation arrow keys are used to try to change the Image size of icons
when there are pictures already stored in the Image List property page, the user
correctly receives the following error message:

   "Property is read-only if imagelist contains images"

However, closing this dialog by pressing the OK button causes the message box to
reappear. This behavior continues in a loop until Microsoft Visual Basic is
terminated.

NOTE: This only occurs if the arrow keys are used in an attempt to change the
image size.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. Add an
   ImageList control to Form1.

2. Choose the ellipsis (...) button adjacent to the Custom property of the
   control. Select the Images tab, click the Insert Picture button, and select
   any picture file.

3. Choose the General tab in the property page and use an arrow key to select an
   image size. The following message box will appear:

   "Property is read-only if imagelist contains images"

Pressing OK causes the message box to reappear in a loop, and Visual Basic has to
be shut down from the Windows Task List.
