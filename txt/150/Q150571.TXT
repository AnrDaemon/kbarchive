SYMPTOMS
========

The documentation for CWnd::DragAcceptFiles() in Books Online states:

   Call this member function from within the main window in your application's
   CWinApp::InitInstance function to indicate that your main window and all
   child windows accept dropped files from the Windows File Manager.

This information is not correct. The message is not propagated to the child
windows.

STATUS
======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since DragAcceptFiles() is a member function of CWnd class, a CWnd pointer is
needed to call this function in CWinApp::InitInstance(). The window that calls
DragAcceptFiles() with the bAccept parameter set to TRUE has identified itself
as able to process the WM_DROPFILES message from Windows File Manager.

For example, in an MFC MDI application, if the CMDIFrameWnd window pointer is
used in the DragAcceptFiles() function call, only the CMDIFrameWnd window gets
the WM_DROPFILES message. This message is not sent to all open CMDIChildWnd
windows. For a CMDIChildWnd window to receive this message, you need to call
DragAcceptFiles() with the CMDIChildWnd window pointer.

The correct documentation is also found in Windows API DragAcceptFiles() function
in Books Online.
