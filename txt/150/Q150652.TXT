Approximate disk space needed: 304 MB

1. Run Magic School Bus Setup from the compact disc.

2. Copy the following item from the compact disc onto the Macintosh Hard Drive
   icon:

   Sea-R

3. Rename Macintosh Hard Drive to "Magic School Bus - Ocean" (without the

You should now be able to run Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean from the hard
drive without inserting the compact disc.

your hard drive is named something other than "Magic School Bus - Ocean;"
otherwise, Setup may fail.
