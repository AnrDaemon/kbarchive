PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Compaq's Insight Agent (versions 2.60b or 2.61b) on a Compaq
Proliant server in which a SCSI tape drive is installed, the server will
eventually run out of memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is corrected by applying Compaq's Softpaq number SP1486, available
from Compaq at 1-800-386-2172.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To apply the Softpaq:

1. Place the SP1486 file in a new directory.

2. Run the Softpaq utility provided by Compaq to decompress the SP1486 file.
   (This will result in the following files: PATCH.EXE, 60B-60C.RTP and
   61B-61C.RTP.)

3. Copy these three files to the location of the Compaq Insight Agents. (This is
   by default %SystemRoot%\SYSTEM32\CPQMGMT.)

4. Stop the simple network management control protocol (SNMP) Service by typing
   the following command at the command prompt:

   "NET STOP SNMP /Y" (without the quotation marks)

5. Run the PATCH utility to update the version of the Insight Agents you have
   installed. It is important to run the PATCH utility using the current .rtp
   file for your version of Insight Agent.

   If you have version 2.60b, run:

   PATCH 60B-60C.RTP

   If you have version 2.61B, run:

   PATCH 61B-61C.RTP

6. Restart the Compaq Insight Agent by typing the following at the command
   prompt:

   "NET START CPQMGMT" (without the quotation marks)

   (This will automatically start the SNMP services.)
