SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article details changes and updates contained in version
1.17c of the Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD) for Windows NT 3.5x (NT
SSD). The information presented was taken directly from the NTreadme.hlp file
found on the SSD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 1.17c release of Compaq's NT SSD contains the following new features and
maintenance modifications:

   Compaq Standby Recovery Server Option

    - New support for both the SMART-2/E and SMART-2/P Controller. (For
      more information, refer to the SMART-2 Array Controller User Guide.)
    - New support for mismatched configurations. (For more information,
      refer to the Recovery Server Option User Guide.)
    - New support for shorter timeout values.
    - New support for ProSignia 300 and 500. (Standby Recovery Server now
      supports all of the following Compaq systems: ProLiant 4500, ProLiant
      4000, ProLiant 2000, ProLiant 1500, ProSignia 500, ProSignia 300.)

   Compaq On-Line Recovery Server Option

    - Support for both the SMART-2/E and SMART-2/P Controllers. (For more
      information, refer to the SMART-2 Array Controller User Guide.)
    - New support for ProSignia 300 and 500.

   Compaq NetFlex-3 Driver

    - Fixed a potential problem where the NetFlex-3/P and NetFlex-3/E
      Controllers could exhibit one of the following:

       - Poor performance
       - List Error Adapter Check (refer to the Event Log)
       - Acknowledge Error Adapter Check (refer to the Event Log)

     - New support for the Compaq 10T PCI UTP and 10/100TX PCI UTP
       Controllers.

   Compaq ISA Hardware Abstraction Layer for Windows NT 3.5x

    - Fixed a problem with how the HAL interfaces with the Power Management
      driver. This problem occurs when you run the Power Management applet
      from Control Panel and try to change the settings. The Control Panel
      applet does not work properly and therefore does not update any
      changes. Some of the symptoms include:

       - Event Log errors
       - Power Management Service termination
       - Application termination

      To fix this problem, install the updated HAL from the Compaq SSD for
      Windows NT 1.17c.
