SYMPTOMS
========

A Lotus Notes client on a Windows NT or Windows 95 computer using NetBIOS and
NWLink on Token Ring may fail to connect to a Lotus Notes server on Ethernet.
This symptom can also occur when a Notes client is on a FDDI ring.

CAUSE
=====

The network adapter on one side of the conversation is on a link that has a
larger frame size than the link on the other side, and IPX does not do
fragmentation. According to the IPX specification, it is up to a higher level to
determine the maximum transmit unit (MTU). For NetBIOS traffic over IPX there is
no MTU negotiation scheme.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, decrease the frame size of the Token Ring network
adapter to 1,012 bytes on the Windows NT computer.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

   \SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES\NWRDR\PARAMETERS

3. Set DefaultMaxPacketSize (reg_dword), to 1012 (decimal).
