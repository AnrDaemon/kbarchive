TITLE   :Session Canceled Error Using IBM 16/4 Adapter II
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform certain read operations between Windows NT computer using an
IBM 16/4 Adapter II network adapter and any Server Message Block (SMB) client or
server, the session to the remote computer stops and a "Session canceled" error
message appears. Additional attempts continue to fail with the same error. For
example, this problem occurs when you copy a file larger than 40 KB from a
remote computer to a Windows NT 3.51 computer on the same physical token ring
network.

CAUSE
=====

The IBM 16/4 Adapter II driver incorrectly reports the maximum receive size to
the transport driver. When the redirector performs a RAW read request and the
data returned is the maximum size allowed, the transport driver flags this as an
error and drops the packet as "too large". This eventually causes the
destination computer to disconnect after a number of retries.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, apply the fix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
