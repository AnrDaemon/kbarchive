-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you post, or drag and drop, a document into a Microsoft Exchange Public
Folder, the Subject field is changed to the document name. Once this is done,
the Subject field cannot be changed except by re-posting with a different file
name.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Title field in Word for Windows by choosing Properties from the File
menu and add this field to the default view of a Public Folder by choosing
Columns from the View menu in the Microsoft Exchange client and adding Title.
You will now be able to open the Word document, go to Properties, fill in the
Title property, and save the document back into the Public Folder.
