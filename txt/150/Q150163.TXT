SYMPTOMS
========

In the Plant Selector area of the Plant Encyclopedia, you can use the Plant
Selector tab to find plants with particular characteristics. After selecting a
particular characteristic, if you click away from the category area (for
example, on a blank area) all your choices are deleted as if you clicked the
Start Over button.

CAUSE
=====

If you move your mouse over the Start Over button (without clicking it), the
Start Over button becomes the "active" button. When you click away from the
category area, the category area closes, but the Start Over button is activated,
and all your choices are canceled.

RESOLUTION
==========

According to Complete Gardening Help, when you are done selecting a category,
you should click the Close button to close the category. Do not click any blank
spots to close the category area.

For more information on how to use Plant Selector categories, please see the
Complete Gardening online Help.
