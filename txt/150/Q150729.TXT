TITLE   :Err Msg: "Access Denied" When Using Account Operator
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Account Operator to manage an NT NetWareEnable account, you may
experience the following symptoms.

When a user with account operator privileges tries to create a new user, the
Maintain NetWare Compatible Login checkbox and the NWCompat button are missing
from the New User and User Properties dialog boxes in User Manager for Domains.

The account operator is unable to change the password for the Windows NT NetWare
Enable user. The following error message appears:

   Access Denied

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to reproduce the problem:

The account operator received the error message "Access Denied" when trying to
change the password for Windows NT NetWare-enable users.

These two users were created by the domain administrator:

   Test_Op = Member of Account Operators
   Test_User = Member of Domain Users with FPNW enabled

If the domain administrator logs off and Test_Op logs on, any attempt to modify
the password of Test_User results in an Access Denied error. (Test_Op can modify
non-NetWare Windows NT account passwords with no problem). The Test_Op can also
be a member of the Console Operators Group for NetWare console operators, but
the same problem exists.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
