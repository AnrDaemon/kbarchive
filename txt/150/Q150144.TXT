TITLE   :Multihomed Client Fails to Refresh Registration with WINS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A multihomed WINS client may fail to refresh its registration with a WINS server
if the client is configured to register with the same WINS server for each
network adapter card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A multihomed computer is one with multiple network cards and/or IP addresses
bound to NetBIOS over TCP/IP. A multihomed WINS client with multiple IP
addresses can register one or more addresses by sending one address at a time in
a multihomed registration packet. A multihomed name in a WINS database can have
one or more addresses.

If a multihomed client is configured to register with the same WINS server for
each network adapter card, the client may fail to send a name-refresh request to
the WINS server asking to renew its registration. Eventually, the WINS server
will time out the multihomed name and scavenge it from the WINS database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
