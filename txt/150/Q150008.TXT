KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Certain applications, such as Btrieve, may fail when you attempt to create a
file that already exists on a File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW)
server.

Btrieve may return the following error:

   Code 25: Cannot Create File

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by FPNW returning a NetWare Core Protocol (NCP)
Completion Code of Failure (FF) when attempting to create the file, instead of
the expected NCP Completion Code of No Create Delete Privilege (85).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
