TITLE   :Cannot Perform a NET VIEW Across RAS to Windows 95 Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT servers and workstations are unable to perform a NET VIEW on a
Windows 95 client when they are dialed in remotely through Remote Access Service
(RAS). The Windows NT clients can perform a NET USE without difficulty, but they
must know the share connection. The Windows 95 remote can perform a NET VIEW or
NET USE to Windows NT servers and workstations or other Windows 95 clients
without difficulty.

The following error message appears in Windows NT when a NET VIEW is performed
from a command prompt:

   System error 1450 has occurred.
   Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.


CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 allows only one server message block (SMB) request at a time from
each client. The Windows NT redirector has code that prevents all the command
slots at a server from being tied up with "long term" operations. Remote API
requests are marked as long term requests.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
