The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Word 6.0 with Bookshelf and select more than one word for
use with the Define command on the shortcut menu, only the first word in the
phrase is considered when you look up the definition.

For example, if you use the Define command after you select "United States," you
see a definition for "unite."

STATUS
======

This is by design in the 16-bit version of Bookshelf. If you want to define a
phrase, use the Microsoft QuickShelf Dictionary Find button.

For more information about Word Integration or the use of QuickShelf, see your
Bookshelf Help.

NOTE: The 32-bit version of Bookshelf '96-97 (running on Windows 95 or Windows NT
3.51) allows you to define multi-word phrases from the Define command on the
shortcut menu.
