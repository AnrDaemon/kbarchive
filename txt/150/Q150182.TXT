TITLE   :FIX: A Picture Box Containing Labels May Not Repaint Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A picture box that contains labels and is larger than the screen size does not
repaint correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use text boxes without borders - BorderStyle set to None - and a BackColor set
to the same color as the label to substitute for the labels. The text boxes
should be made read-only.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project. Form1 is created by default. Place a picture box on the
   form, and then place a label control inside the picture box.

2. In the Properties window for the picture box, change the Height property to a
   large value, such as 20000.

3. Drag the picture box up until you can view the lower border. Notice that the
   section of the picture box that was below the screen does not correctly
   repaint. When the label is removed, the problem goes away.

NOTE: This problem can also occur at run-time.
