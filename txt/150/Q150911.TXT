TITLE   :CACLS Output Cannot Be Redirected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51 SP5,4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 SP5, 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 SP5, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to redirect the output of CACLS to a file, the resulting
information is incomplete. For example, the display output of "cacls c:\" is:

   c:\ BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)F
   Everyone:(OI)(CI)C
   CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)F
   NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F

If you redirect the ouput with "cacls c:\ >file.out," File.out only contains
the following:

   \:(OI)(CI)F
   :(OI)(CI)C
   :(OI)(CI)F
   \:(OI)(CI)F

CAUSE
=====

With Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0 and Service Pack 5 for Windows NT 3.51,
Cacls.exe was modified to handle extended characters. This modification required
output routines that cannot be redirected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use Cacls.exe that ships with the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM or use XCACLS from the
Windows NT Server Resource Kit with Update 1.

NOTE: Xcacls.exe is located in the folder where you installed the Windows NT
Resource Kit; the default location is C:\Ntreskit. On the Resource Kit CD, it is
located in the following folder:

   D:\<platform>\Netadmin

where D: is your CDROM drive and <platform> is your computer platform, such
as i386 or Alpha.
