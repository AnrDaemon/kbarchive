TITLE   :XCLN: Exchng32 Causes Invalid Page Fault on ThinkPads
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client on an IBM ThinkPad, you
might see the following error when you exit Microsoft Exchange:

   EXCHNG32 caused an invalid page fault in module <unknown> at
   0000;10001b50

CAUSE
=====

The ThinkPad has Collabra Share installed, an add-on extension for Microsoft
Exchange. Collabra Share includes an extension DLL to automatically launch the
application from the Microsoft Exchange toolbar. This DLL causes the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Exit the Microsoft Exchange client and use the Windows 95 Registry Editor
(Regedit.exe) to find the following key in the Windows 95 registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      SOFTWARE
         Microsoft
            Exchange
               Client
                  Extensions

Delete the following value:

   QuickLaunch   "4.0;C:\COLLABRA\POLL95.DLL;1;01000000000001;111000"

Restart the Microsoft Exchange client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys and
Values online Help topic in Regedit.exe. Note that you should make a backup copy
of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the registry.

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.
