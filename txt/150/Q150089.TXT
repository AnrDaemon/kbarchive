The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

InstallShield3 requires the "-SMS" parameter for Setup.exe on the Command Line
of an SMS Package. Having it there will force the connection from the client to
the SMS Distribution server to stay open and will allow Setup.exe to run on
remote computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example illustrates this issue:

      Normal:  SETUP or SETUP -fc:\test.ins
      SMS:     SETUP -SMS or SETUP -fc:\test.ins -SMS

-SMS indicates that Setup.exe should continue to run until the installation is
done, thus allowing SMS to keep the remote computer connected. This adds the
ability for Setup.exe to continue to run until the main installation engine is
done.

NOTE: This command has nothing to do with silent mode -S.

The "-SMS" parameter is supported in versions 2.20.903 and greater of the
InstallShield Software Developer's Kit (SDK), and documentation is listed under
the "Setup.exe" topic in the online reference for versions 3.097 and earlier.
