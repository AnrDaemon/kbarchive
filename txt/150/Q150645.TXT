TITLE   :INFO: Minor Inconsistencies in the Header Log for <filename>
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The error message: "There are Minor inconsistencies in the Header Log for
<Filename>" occurs when running Analyze Build 1309 or greater on the
database for the first time, where <Filename> is the eight-character
SourceSafe database file name. This message is the result of eight extra bytes
added to the file during the conversion process, such as after running DDCONV.

Installations of Visual SourceSafe 5.0 will experience this error message when
using the -v4 directive as part of the Analyze command when run for the first
time on the database, such as Analyze -v4 C:\VSS\Data.

The -v4 provides the greatest level of information from the Analyze pass and
includes messages of an informational nature as well as errors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error does not represent a significant danger to the integrity of the
SourceSafe Database, and is corrected when Analyze is run with the -F
parameter.

Please note that Analyze -F does make changes to the data files in SourceSafe.
All users must log off SourceSafe while Analyze is running with the -F switch.

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you back up the database before beginning
this procedure.
