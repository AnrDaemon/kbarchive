TITLE   :FIX: C2682 Using dynamic_cast to Cast to a Const Pointer Type
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When casting a const pointer of derived class to a const pointer of base class,
the compiler generates the following error message:

   

   C2682: cannot use dynamic_cast to convert from "'const class 'name1'*

          to 'const class 'name2'*'"

where name1 and name2 refer to the names of your derived class and base class
respectively.

RESOLUTION
==========

Cast the derived class const pointer to a derived class non-const pointer. Then
use the derived class non-const pointer in the dynamic_cast expression. See the
MORE INFORMATION section of this article for sample code and a workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the problem and generates the compiler
error C2682. The workaround is shown in the comments in the sample code below.

Sample Code
-----------

         #define WORKAROUND  /* Uncomment this line to workaround */ 
         class A
         {
           virtual void f() { } ;
         } ;

         class B : public A
         {
         } ;

         void g(const B* pb)
         {
         #ifndef WORKAROUND
            const A* pa = dynamic_cast<const A*>(pb) ;
         #else
            B* tmpBp = const_cast<B*>(pb) ;
            const A* pa = dynamic_cast<const A*>(tmpBp) ;
         #endif
         }

         void main()
         {
            B bObj ;
            const B* pb = &bObj ;
            g(pb) ;
         }
