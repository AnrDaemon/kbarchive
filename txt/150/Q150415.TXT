TITLE   :FPNW Printing Causes File Cache to Grow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you transfer large print jobs from Novell NetWare clients to a server running
File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW,) you notice a user interface
performance degradation. The jobs need to have about the size of the physical
memory of the machine.

If you look at performance counters while this happens, you find that the counter
for the file cache (Memory: Cache Bytes) is very high while the process working
sets decline (Process: Working Set, instance _Total.)

CAUSE
=====

While writing spool files the FPNW printing does not use the flag
FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN to open the files. Thus cache manager increases the
cache size when data is read or written since it expects the application to need
it again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
Netware 4.0. A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends
that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact
Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
