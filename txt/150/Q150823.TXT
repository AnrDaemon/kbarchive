TITLE   :Trap 0xA When Token Ring Source Routing Data Exceeds 18 Bytes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible for a Trap 0xA to occur on a Windows NT computer in a Token Ring
network if packets are received with source routing information exceeding the
maximum length of 18 bytes.

In a reported case, a STOP Message (blue screen) resulted when source routing
data of 22 bytes was received. A partial frame is shown below. The value d6
resolves to the following:

         /-------- Single route Broadcast
              /---- SR data length 0x16 (22 bytes decimal)

 d6   110 10110

CAUSE
=====

The additional Source Routing information exceeded the length of a static
buffer. This results in the address containing the connection link being
overwritten. Several routines (NbfResetLink and MacConstructHeader) attempted to
use the overwritten link value and thus, generated the traps.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
4.0.

This problem has been corrected for Windows NT 3.51 with an updated version of
NBF.SYS. The bad packet is rejected at a lower level in
NbfGeneralReceiveHandler, since it is considered a malformed token ring packet.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0.
