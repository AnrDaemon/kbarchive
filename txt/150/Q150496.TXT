TITLE   :CLI_DOS /R Does Not Remove Extra Space in LOAD Line of WIN.ini
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Cli_Dos /R, the Smsrun16.exe file is removed from the Win.ini.
However, if this file is in between two other files the extra space is not
removed and an error message appears when you bring up Windows.

In other words, the following line:

   load=fileA<space>smsrun16.exe<space>fileB

becomes this line when you run Cli_Dos/R:

   load=fileA<space><space>fileB

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must manually delete the extra space.
