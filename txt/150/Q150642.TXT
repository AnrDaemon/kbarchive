TITLE   :HOWTO: Use SSInt.exe in Visual SourceSafe
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbVBp400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To integrate SourceSafe with the 16-bit edition of Microsoft Visual Basic
version 4.0, you need to install a 16-bit version of SourceSafe and then run the
SSINT.EXE file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the user has installed Visual SourceSafe and source code management is not
available on the menu of the 16-bit edition of Visual Basic 4.0, the VB.INI file
needs to be updated to integrate with Visual SourceSafe.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Go to the directory where Visual SourceSafe is installed on the server.

2. Select the WIN directory, and double-click the SSINT.EXE file.

3. Ensure that Update VB.INI is checked, and click OK.

4. Visual SourceSafe is now integrated with the 16-bit Edition of Visual Basic
   4.0.

With Visual SourceSafe 4.0, a Custom installation is required to install the
16-bit version on a 32-bit operating system. With Visual SourceSafe 4.0a, there
is Netsetup.exe and a Netset16.exe. The Netset16.exe should be used if the
16-bit Visual SourceSafe client is to be installed on a 32-bit operating system.
The Netsetup.exe assumes that you want to install the same bit client as
operating system (for example, 16-bit client on 16-bit operating system or
32-bit client on 32-bit operating system.)

For instructions regarding Visual SourceSafe 5.0, see the readme.wri file in the
Ss_16bit folder in the Visual SourceSafe 5.0 CD-ROM.
