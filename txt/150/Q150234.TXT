TITLE   :BUG: Sheridan Panel Doesn't Correctly Align if Visible is False
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp400bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Sheridan Panel control does not correctly align to the bottom of a form
after a window is resized if the Visible property of the control is set to False
during the resize of the window.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the position of the status bar using code. For example, rather than setting
the Visible property of the status bar to True, calculate and set the position
before showing the bar. The following code aligns the bar to the bottom of a
Form before showing it:

      SSPanel1.Align = 0
      SSPanel1.Top = Form1.Top + Form1.Width - SSPanel1.Width
      SSPanel1.Visible = True
      SSPanel1.Align = 2

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Sheridan Panel on the form, and set its Align property to 2 - Align
   Bottom.

3. Place two Command buttons on Form1. In the Click event for Command1, place
   the following code:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
         SSPanel1.Visible = False
         End Sub

4. In the Click event for the second Command button, place the following code:

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
         SSPanel1.Visible = True
         End Sub

5. Run the project by pressing the F5 key. Click the Command1 button to cause
   the panel to disappear. Resize the window, and then click the Command2 button
   to cause the panel to reappear.

Note that the panel appears in the middle of the form where the bottom of the
form was prior to the Resize event.

To work around the problem, place the code in the WORKAROUND Section above in the
Click event of the Command2 button.
