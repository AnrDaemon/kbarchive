SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to resolve Email alias names in Microsoft Exchange
clients using the equal sign(=).

MORE INFORMATION
================

In most companies there are Email users that have the same first and last names.
Their Email aliases will vary but when you try and resolve the name, you will
get a list and must select the person to whom you intend to send Email. This
also applies to Email aliases that are similar. For example:

   Danial Aaby's Email alias is:    Daniala
   Danial Aalberg's Email alias is: Danialaa

You want to send mail to Danial Aaby.

When you enter in 'Daniala' as the Email alias you wish to resolve, the Microsoft
Exchange client will display both users names in a Check Name dialog list box
where you must then select the appropriate name.

If you use the Equal sign in front of the users Email alias, then the alias name
will be resolved to the exact match after the Equal sign. In other words, by
typing:

   =daniala

in the To: (or Cc: field) and resolving, the user Danial Aaby will be resolved
and a Check Name dialog list box will not be displayed.
