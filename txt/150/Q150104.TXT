TITLE   :Removing Entry from Directory Replication Configuration Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Modifications to the To or From lists in the Directory Replication dialog box
are not saved when you also change the status of replication (that is, whether
to import or export directories) before clicking OK to accept the changes and
close the dialog box. (The Directory Replication dialog box is reached by going
into Control Panel, clicking the Server icon, then clicking the Directory
Replication button.)

RESOLUTION
==========

Make changes to the Directory Replication dialog box in two separate steps.

1. Make desired changes to the To or From lists, then click OK.

2. Reopen the dialog box and make any desired changes in the Do Not Export or Do
   Not Import buttons. Click OK to save these changes and complete the process.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
