SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the SPREAD() intrinsic function to copy an array into an array one
dimension larger, you may find that some large arrays cause the following
application error at run-time:

Under Windows 95:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

   Details:

   <program> caused an invalid page fault in module <program.exe> at
   0137:004013d7

Under Windows NT version 3.51:

   The instruction at "0x00000000" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory
   could not be "read".

STATUS
