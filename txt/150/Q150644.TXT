======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using SourceSafe Command Line commands, such as SS CD or SS CP, to set the
current project, you need to use quotation marks (" ") around a project name
that contains a space. The quotation marks must surround the entire project path
name or switch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Failure to enclose the project name in quotation marks results in the following
error message:

   You may only specify one project for this command

Follow this example for any SourceSafe command line command that contains a
space.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

From the Command prompt or MS-DOS session:

1. Change to the Root ($/) project:

   SS CP $/

   NOTE: SourceSafe returns: Current Project is $/.

2. Create a project named First Project from the Root:

   SS CREATE "First Project"

   (Note the quotation marks around the project name.)

   NOTE: This command without the quotes, that is SS CREATE First Project, will
   create two projects, one named First and the other Projects.

3. Change to the new project:

   SS CP "$/First Project"
