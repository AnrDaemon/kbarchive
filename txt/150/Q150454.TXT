The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is not recommended that you assign different LUs to user groups that have
members in common because the results cannot be predicted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to the SNA Server version 3.0 "Administration Guide," Chapter 3:

   If a user is assigned LUs through one or more accounts, such as group
   accounts and the user's individual account, the LUs do not accumulate.
   Instead, one account determines the access for that user. The account that
   determines this access is the account found first in the following search
   order:

   1. User accounts (highest priority)

   2. Domain groups

   3. Local groups

   4. Well-known groups such as Everyone (lowest priority)

However, it does not explain clearly what will happen if two groups are at the
same level (2 local groups).

SNA Server will use the LUs assigned to whichever group is returned first from
Microsoft Windows NT, and there is no way to predict the order in which the
groups will be returned.
