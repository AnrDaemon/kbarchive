TITLE   :XADM: Explanation of Exchange PCMTA's /Z Parameter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5

KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange PCMTA service uses a /Z parameter to indicate that the
Microsoft Exchange Server service account should be used to validate the
connection to a MSMail postoffice share. This parameter is stored in the Windows
NT registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This parameter is stored in the Registry under the PCMTA instance created by the
administrator:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
                            \<PCMTAinstance>\Parameters

The values DrivesUNC and DrivesWAN hold the connection information for the MSMail
postoffices. The format is as follows:

   DrivesUNC:REG_MULTI_SZ:\\serverA\share1 /Z \\serverB\share2 /Z ...
   DrivesWAN:REG_MULTI_SZ:\\serverC\share3 /Z \\serverD\share4 /Z ...

Note: DrivesWAN connections are set by either disabling dispatch on the instance
of PCMTA or selecting not to pick up mail for a particular postoffice.

When connection information is required, the /Z parameter will be followed by the
encrypted Connect As information. For example:

   DrivesUNC:REG_MULTI_SZ:\\serverA\share1 /Z DOMAIN\user 742SF32JA234
   234J53AA001

Because all these parameters are automatically entered by the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program, there is no need to manually edit the Registry with this
information.

Additional query words: command line novell lanman connector mta
