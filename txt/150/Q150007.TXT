TITLE   :Failed FPNW Logon Attempt Maps to F:\
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Login.exe file from Microsoft File and Print Services for
NetWare (FPNW) version 3.51 and 4.0, and you fail in an attempt to log on to a
Novell server, the failed attempt will root map the Novell server's login area
to F:\. This becomes a problem if a Novell login script expects to be in and at
a certain drive and directory prompt, such as F:\LOGIN.

Normally, Novell NETX shell behavior is not to root map the login area, even in
the case of logon failure. With a Novell NETX shell running on a DOS 6.x
computer, Novell's Login.exe would normally, in the event of a logon failure,
leave the user at the login area prompt, usually F:\LOGIN. You would then be
able to change out of this directory to another directory, such as F:\PUBLIC.
However, this is not how FPNW'S Login.exe file operates.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of this problem is currently under investigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that all logon attempts using FPNW'S Login.exe program supply a valid
user name and password to avoid a possible failure in the execution of the
user's Novell logon script.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
