TITLE   :CSNW May Fail to Execute Login Script Map Commands
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Client Service for NetWare (CSNW) supplied with the Czech version of
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 to execute login scripts from a Novell NetWare
server, map commands within the login script may fail. This problem does not
effect network drive mappings made from within the Windows NT user interface.

CAUSE
=====

The localized name the network provider registers is different from the
localized name the NetWare login script processor Nwscript.exe uses to find the
correct network provider. Thus Nwscript.exe fails to execute map commands.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To workaround this problem, change the value of the following registry key

   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \NWCWorkstation\networkprovider\Name

from the localized string to the string "NetWare or Compatible Network."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Czech language version of
Windows NT version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
