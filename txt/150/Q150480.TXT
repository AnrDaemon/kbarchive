TITLE   :Mac Music Central: Sounds Play Poorly on 5200, 5215 Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Music Central for the Macintosh, 1996, 1997 editions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Music Central introduction screen appears, the startup sound plays
poorly. Also, when you play song clips, the sound may play poorly and the slide
bar may not move.

This occurs on Macintosh 5200 and 5215 computers. This problem can occur on lower
performance Macintosh computers such as the SE/30.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Music Central 1996 and 1997. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no resolution that will keep the problem from occurring. However, you
can turn off the startup sequence sound. To turn off the sound, do the
following:

1. Open Music Central.

2. Click the Start button (in the lower-right corner).

3. On the Features menu, click Settings.

4. Clear the check mark from Play Title Screen Sequence selection, and then
   click OK.

The startup sound will not play the next time you start Music Central.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Quality of the audio playback may be slightly increased by optimizing the
performance of Music Central. The information necessary to do this can be found
in the "Read Me" file located on the Music Central 96 compact disc.
