SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete a large number of users from within the Users and Groups window
of SNA Server Admin causes an application exception error similar to the
following:

   An application error has occurred
   and an application error log is being generated.

   snaadmin.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x00a3169c

In addition, the Application Event Log will report the following error:

   Event ID: 4097
   Source: DrWatson
   Description: The application, snaadmin.DBG, generated an application
   error. The error occurred on 4/10/1996 @ 11:07:30.280. The exception
   generated was c0000005 at address 00a3169c (HashRemove).

   A DRWTSN32.LOG containing the details of the application exception
   will be located in the <windir> directory.


CAUSE

The Application Exception error occurs because the HashRemove() function in SNA
Server Admin is trying to remove an uninitialized hash entry when you delete a
large number of users.

==========

SNACFG.DLL has been updated to correct the problem.
