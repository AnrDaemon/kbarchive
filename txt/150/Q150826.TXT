SUMMARY
=======

The following batch file will create a listing of environment variables when a
client connects to a Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).

Create a file with Notepad and type the following lines of code. Save the file in
the scripts directory as Environment.cmd.

      @echo off
      echo Content-Type: text/plain
      echo.
      set

From a browser, type the http://<Web Server Name>/<Path to the Script
file>

where, WWW.UNKNOWN.COM is the full qualified Domain Name, and
SCRIPTS/ENVIRONMENT.CMD? is the Path to the Script file. For example:,
HTTP://WWW.UNKNOWN.COM/SCRIPTS/ENVIRONMENT.CMD?

NOTE: The question mark is very important. It informs the server that this is a
GET request instead of downloading the file.
