TITLE   :SNA Server Admin Application Exception When Use Banyan Vines
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbnetserv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you exit the SNA Server Admin, you may get an application exception if the
SNA Server is installed on a Microsoft Windows NT Server running the Banyan
Vines version 5.56(30) redirector. The application exception is similar to the
following:

   snaadmin.exe - application error

   The instruction at "0x77f8d637" referenced memory at "0x00000010". The memory
   could not be "written".

   Click OK to terminate the application.

In addition, SNA Server logs the following message in the Application Event log:

   Event ID: 560
   Source: SNA Base Service
   Description: Read from mailslot failed, rc = 165

CAUSE
=====

The application exception occurs when SNA Server Admin tries to close a Vines
socket from the Client/Server interface's detach entry point.

The Event 560 message is caused because the 5.56(30) version of the Banyan Vines
redirector returns a different error code on the VnsSocketReceive() API than
earlier versions when the socket is closed.

These two problems did not occur with previous versions of the Banyan Vines
redirector.


RESOLUTION
==========

Snadmod.dll and Snabv.dll have been updated so that the Vines socket is closed
before the Client/Server interface's detach entry point is called.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.1, 2.11,
and 2.11.sp1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
