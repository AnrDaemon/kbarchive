DOCUMENT:Q150108  08-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :User in 15 or More Groups Can't Connect to RCMD Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a user who is a member of at least 15 global groups tries to use the Remote
Command Service with the following command:

   rcmd \\<servername>

the computer returns the following error:

   Error - Failed to connect to \\<servername>, system not found or
   service not active.

If the command is run locally, the computer returns the following error:

   Error - Remote command server failed to respond, Error = 109


When this occurs, Remote Command Service becomes unusable for all users; when any
user tries to connect to the service, the computer generates the earlier error
until the service is stopped and restarted.

CAUSE
=====

The application was expecting a return code of ERROR_MORE_DATA from a call to
GetTokenInformation, not the return code ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER.


RESOLUTION
==========

Reduce the number of global groups that the user is a member of from 15 to 14 or
fewer, or apply the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-
tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support
Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
