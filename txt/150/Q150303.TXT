SUMMARY
=======

You can back up profile rules to a separate .PST file. For example, you might
want to save the .PAB and .PST files, but not the rules. Or you might want to
make a copy of the rules and apply them to different mailboxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To back up rules, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Personal Folder (PST).

2. Add a new folder to the PST named Test.

3. Select the new folder.

4. Click Application Design on the Tools menu and select the Copy Folder Design
   option.

   NOTE: This step applies to Outlook users only. Choose Folder from the File
   menu and selct the Copy Folder Design.

5. Select the Inbox.

6. Make sure the Rules box is selected.

7. Click the OK button.

This will copy the rules to the folder in the PST. The rules will not do anything
in this folder except exist.

If the Microsoft Exchange Server is lost with no hope of recovery or restoration,
you can reverse the above procedure to copy the rules back to your Inbox after
the Microsoft Exchange Server is re-installed.

For additional information on how to import rules from this PST file to another
mailbox, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
