======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you start and then quit Bookshelf '96-'97 for the Power Macintosh, it is
not possible to change the programs memory allocation or to throw the file away.

CAUSE
=====

To minimize the number of extensions that Microsoft Bookshelf must install into
the Extensions folder, a number of PowerPC shared libraries have been built into
the Bookshelf itself. Because these libraries can stay open even after the
application has quit, you are not able to change the memory allocated to the
application in the Get Info window.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the memory allocated to the program, or to throw the file away, you
must first restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior only occurs with the Power Macintosh version of Bookshelf. It will
not happen with the non-Power Macintosh (680x0 version) that is also included on
the Bookshelf '96-'97 compact disc.
