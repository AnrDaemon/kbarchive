SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Visual Basic program contains an Option button that is set to True
at runtime. However, the program is designed so a user cannot get to the Option
Button by using the Tab key. For this condition to occur, the TabStop property
of the Option button is set to False and the Value property is set to True at
design time. When running the program, you can tab to the Option button.

CAUSE
=====

The TabStop property is changed to True at run-time.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the TabStop property to False in the LostFocus event of each option button.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
