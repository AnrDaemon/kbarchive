SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) does not return a username for
the variable REMOTE_USER unless the WWW Service Properties dialog box options
for BASIC (CLEAR TEXT) Password Authentication is selected and Allow Anonymous
is cleared.

If you wish to use the REMOTE_USER variable in a CGI script, you will have to use
BASIC (CLEAR TEXT) Password Authentication. With Anonymous authentication, it
assumes the user is Anonymous and the variable is not a value assigned.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following batch file will display in a browser the environment variables
used by IIS to include REMOTE_USER:

      @echo off
      echo Content-Type: text/plain
      echo.
      set

Additional query words: prodnt not selected
