TITLE   :BUG: Sheridan Frame and Panel Stretch Font with Move Method
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp400bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Move method is invoked on a Sheridan Frame or Panel control, the font is
stretched if the size of the control is modified by the Move method.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Since this behavior does not occur with the Microsoft Frame control, use it
   instead of the Sheridan Frame control.

 - Instead of using the Move method to resize the control, the width and height
   of the control can be adjusted directly. For example, the following code
   makes the Frame the same height and width as the form, and places its upper
   left hand corner to the upper left hand corner of the form:

         SSFrame1.Move 0, 0, Form1.ScaleWidth, Form1.ScaleHeight

 - Replace the line of code above with:

         SSFrame1.Width = Form1.ScaleWidth

         SSFrame1.Height = Form1.ScaleHeight

         SSFrame1.Left = Form1.ScaleLeft

         SSFrame1.Top = Form1.ScaleTop

This code will not stretch the Caption of the control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Sheridan Frame control on Form1. If the Sheridan controls are not
   visible in the Toolbox, from the Tools menu, select Custom Controls, and then
   select Sheridan 3D Controls. In the Form_Click event, place the following
   code:

         Private Sub Form_Click()
         SSFrame1.Move 0, 0, Form1.ScaleWidth, Form1.ScaleHeight

         End Sub

3. Run the project by pressing the F5 key. Click on the Form, and notice that
   the Font for the caption of the frame control is stretched.
