SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting ODBC access to Oracle 7.x RDBMS servers, it may be
necessary to verify that the underlying SQL*Net and Oracle Protocol Adapters are
correctly installed. To do this you can use the Oracle supplied utility
NETTEST.EXE found in the ORAWIN\BIN directory.

Nettest is a simple utility that attempts to only login to the selected server
using the installed SQL*Net software that is part of the Oracle client. The
utility will ask for a login name, password, and TNS connect string. If the
Oracle client is correctly installed, the utility will simply display "Ping
Successful." If the login was not successful, the user will need to consult with
their database administrator.

Additional query words: Oracle ping SQLNet
