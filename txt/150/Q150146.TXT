TITLE   :PRB: No Error Generated Initializing Named Common Block Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The compiler does not generate an error or warning message when you initialize a
named common block object in a type statement outside of a block data
subprogram.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the /4Ys compiler option to enable strict FORTRAN 90 standard usage, and
force the compiler to catch the assignment of the named common block in a type
statement outside a block data subprogram.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Code to Illustrate Behavior
----------------------------------

   ! Compile options needed: none

         INTEGER I /1/ 
         COMMON /TheBlock/ I
         PRINT *, 'Initializing Common Block Object...'
         END
