The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh development environment is designed to
run on a Macintosh PowerPC. However, the professional edition of Visual FoxPro
for Macintosh allows development of applications that run on a Macintosh with a
68k processor. When developing applications that access remote data via ODBC, it
is important to understand which versions of the ODBC drivers are required by
both the development environment and distributed applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the Visual FoxPro development environment only runs on a Macintosh
PowerPC, the appropriate PowerPC ODBC driver must be installed to access remote
data.

When distributing a PowerPC version of an application, the same ODBC driver used
during development is used with the distributed application. However, when
distributing a 68k version of an application, a separate 68k ODBC driver must be
used.
