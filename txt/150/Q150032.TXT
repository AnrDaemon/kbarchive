TITLE   :Shared Application Still Running Error After Logoff
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you are using a 16-bit Windows client and running a shared application such as
Microsoft Word or Excel, and you close the application and immediately log off
without exiting Windows, you may after a short time receive the following error
message from Program Group Control:

   You have just logged off with shared applications running. Log back on and
   close your shared applications.

The message is incorrect because there are no shared applications running.

CAUSE
=====

Every 60 seconds, Program Group Control checks on the status of the shared
applications. It goes down its Task List incrementing a variable for each
running application and checking to see if that application is still running. If
the application is not running, Program Group Control removes it from its Task
List but does not decrement the variable. Therefore, the count it keeps of
running applications is incorrect for the first check after an application has
been closed. The count is corrected on the second check, 60 seconds later.

WORKAROUND
==========

Wait at least one minute after closing the last open shared application before
logging off, if you do not intend to exit Windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.2.
