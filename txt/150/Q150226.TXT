TITLE   :BUG: Sheridan Panel Receives Focus & Active Control Loses Focus
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp400bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the 16-bit edition of Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0, clicking on a Sheridan
Panel causes the panel to receive the focus while causing the active control on
the panel to lose the focus. Users are unable to send any input to the Panel
control, and the control lacks a GotFocus or LostFocus event.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Click event of the panel, place the following lines of code:

      Private Sub SSPanel1_Click()
         SendKeys "{TAB}"
         Beep
      End Sub

When the user clicks or double-clicks the frame control, the focus is restored to
the control that had the focus previously. However, the user is unable to use
keystrokes to tab to the frame control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in the 16-bit edition of Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is
   created by default.

2. Place a Sheridan Panel control on Form1.

3. Place a Text box on the Sheridan panel.

4. Press F5 to run the project and click on the Sheridan panel. The Text box
   loses the focus.

To correct this problem, place the code from the Workaround section above into
the Click event of the Sheridan panel control.
