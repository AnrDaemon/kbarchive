The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the DrawMode property of the Graph control is set to 5 when an application is
running on Windows 95, nothing is printed. Under Windows NT, printing is not
reliable either.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the PaintPicture method to print out the graph. The following code enables
the graph to print out consistently:

      Printer.PaintPicture Graph1.Picture, Printer.Width / 4, _
       Printer.Height / 4, Printer.Width / 2, Printer.Height / 2
      Printer.EndDoc

With the code above, the upper left-hand corner of the graph is positioned a
quarter of the width of the paper across and down from the upper-left hand
corner of the paper. The graph is made half as high and half as tall as the
paper.

For additional options, please see the online Help for the PaintPicture method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Graph control on Form1.

3. Place a Command button on Form1, and in the Click event for the Command
   button, place the following code:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Graph1.DrawMode = 5
         End Sub

Run the program by pressing the F5 key and press the Command button to print out
the graph. The graph on the screen changes shading temporarily, but there is no
print-out.
