TITLE   :DEC FDDI Adapters Fail to Respond to Broadcasts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT 3.51 DEFEA.SYS or DEFPA.SYS for the DEC EISA or PCI
FDDI network adapters, the driver fails to respond to broadcast packets.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the DEC FDDI adapter is reset. The problem occurs after
a reset because the driver fails to register the broadcast address filter with
the adapter after the reset.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the DEC FDDI adapter is initialized the device driver is responsible for
registering the broadcast address on the adapter. In event the device driver has
to reset the adapter for any reason, it is the drivers responsibility to
completely reinitialize the adapter, including registering the broadcast address
filter.

The DEC FDDI adapter can be reset by the driver for a variety of reasons during
normal use including requests to reset from a transport, and network conditions
that generate adapter errors.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, apply the fix mentioned below.

STATUS
======
