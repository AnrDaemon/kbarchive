TITLE   :Client Setup is Unable To Validate Windows Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a shared installation of Windows from a NetWare server, where your
Windows directory also resides on a NetWare server, the following error will
occur while running cli_dos in verbose mode:

   Reading configuration...Could not Validate Windows path:
   <Path to Windows directory>

where <Path to Windows directory> denotes the complete path to the Windows
directory on the NetWare server. For example, \USERS\JOHNDOE\WIN31.

NOTE: This problem occurs on NetWare clients running NETX only. This problem does
not occur on NetWare clients running VLM.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you run the setup /n from the Windows administrative share on the NetWare
server, specify that the Windows directory be installed locally (that is,
C:\windows).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q140781, "How Systems Management Server Detects
a Windows Client," states the following:

NOTE: Shared Windows is currently not supported by Systems Management Server, but
a reasonable effort has been made to contend with it.
