TITLE   :FIX: Absolute Pathnames for Source Files Placed in Makefile
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.0 4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Developer Studio generated Makefile contains absolute path names for source
files.

CAUSE
=====

The source files reside in a directory other than the project directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the Makefile to use relative paths by opening the .mak file in text
mode.

CAUTION: Be extremely careful not to add any extra spaces or unexpected
characters.

NOTE: Anytime the IDE writes to the .mak file, your changes are overwritten and
the full path name is re-installed. Make a backup copy of the .mak file
immediately after adding the relative paths to ensure that changes can be
re-entered if there is a problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
