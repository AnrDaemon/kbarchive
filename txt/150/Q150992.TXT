 - Microsoft Complete Gardening for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Complete Gardening, when you print an article containing more than
one major section (such as an entire entry from the Plant Encyclopedia), a large
area of white space is added to the end of each section on the printout.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the article into a text editor such as Microsoft WordPad. Edit the article
to remove the white spaces and print it directly from the text editor. To
accomplish this task, do the following:

1. Click the Complete Gardening icon at the upper left corner of the program
   window to activate the control menu.

2. On the control menu, click Copy. This copies the article to the Clipboard.

3. Open a text editor such as Microsoft WordPad (provided with Windows 95).

4. On the Edit menu, click Paste. This pastes the article into the text editor.

5. Edit the article to remove the areas of white space between sections.

6. Print the article directly from the text editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Complete Gardening
version 1.0 for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
