TITLE   :FIX: C1001 Fatal Error in File Main.c, Line 413 for /O1 or /O2
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.00 4.10
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using /O1 (minimize size) or /O2 (maximize speed) causes a C1001 error in a try
block with the following error message:

   

   fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
    (compiler file '\school.tp3\test\c10\src\P2\main.c', line 413)

Additionally, C++ exception handling must be enabled (/GX). If the warning level
is set to 4 (/W4), C4702 (unreachable code) warnings are issued before the C1001
fatal error.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of the problem is having both /Og (global optimizations) and inline
function expansion /Ob1 (Only __inline) or /Ob2 (Any Suitable) compiling. /O1
and /O2 are both compound switches, including /Og and /Ob1.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable either global optimizations (/Og-) or inline function expansion (/Ob1-
or /Ob2-). Please see the More Information section below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 32-bit Edition
version 4.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code reproduces the error when compiled:

      // Compile option needed are: /GX, /W4, and /O1(minimize size)
      // or /O2 (maximize speed)
      struct A
      {
              ~A(){}
      };
      struct B
      {
              A       a;
      };
      void main(void)
      {
              try                     // line 17
              {
                  B       *pB = new B[4];
                  delete [] pB;  // line 20, warning C4702: unreachable code
              }
              catch(...)
              {
              }
      }

The following error message is generated:

   

   test.cpp(17) : fatal error C1001: INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR
     (compiler file '\school.tp3\test\c10\src\P2\main.c', line 413)

Compiling from command line with both /Og (global optimizations) and in-line
function expansion, /Ob1(Only __inline) or /Ob2 (Any Suitable), reproduces the
error. For instance, using:

   cl  /Og /Ob1 /GX /W4 test.cpp

Compiling with the following switch settings in command line does not produce
errors:

   cl  /Og /GX /W4 test.cpp

- or -

   cl  /Ob1 /GX /W4 test.cpp

One workaround when using /O1 or /O2 in Developer Studio is to disable In-line
function expansion (Build:Settings, C++ Tab, Optimizations category). Another
workaround is to disable global optimizations. To accomplish this, choose Custom
for the type of optimization (Build:Settings, C++ Tab, Optimizations category).
Check all categories that apply, but do not check global optimizations. This
behavior is similar to using the components of /O1 or /O2 and eliminating /Og).
An additional method is to leave /O1 or /O2 intact and manually add /Og- to the
Project Options.
