TITLE   :FIX: "Function call on Left-hand side of assignment..." Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Read-Only property of a Text box is set in code, trying to run a project
brings up the following error message:

   "Function call on left-hand side of assignment must return Variant or Object"

The environment shows a line of code that does not involve a property where an
object or variant is necessary.

CAUSE
=====

The problem with the code has nothing to do with the return value of a function.
Although the error message is misleading and incorrect, it is an error to try
and set a Read-Only property.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not attempt to set a Read-Only property in code (by definition).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a TextBox control to Form1.

3. In the Form_Load event, place the following code:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Text1.HideSelection = False
         End Sub

4. Run the program by pressing the F5 key. The error message occurs.
