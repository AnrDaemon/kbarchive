The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print to a Cyclone Print Station from Windows NT, the following
errors may occur. When you print using Line Printer Remote (LPR), the following
error message appears:

   Error: print server did not accept print request. Job aborted

Or, when you print a document from an application connected to the print share in
Printer Manager, a Messenger Service dialog box displays the following error
message:

   Printing on <Printer Share> [lpr printer address:printer name] printing
   errors occured

RESOLUTION
==========

If you cannot print to a Cyclone Print Station print server from Windows NT, you
must add the Windows NT hostname and IP address of the Windows NT server to the
Hosts.lpd file found on the Cyclone Print Station in the etc directory of the
UNIX workstation. Adding the Windows NT hostname and IP address to the Hosts.lpd
file gives permission for the client to print to the Cyclone Print Station print
server.
