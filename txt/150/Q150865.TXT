OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the SNA Server service in SNA Admin, the status may go to
Pending and back to Inactive. The System Event log may also contain the
following Event ID 7001 message:

   The SnaServer service depends on the SnaTdlc1 service which failed to
   start because of the following error: The file could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

The IBM Twinax Link Service is not installed properly if you install SNA Server
2.11, then update immediately to SP1 without first installing the IBM Twinax
link service, or installing from the SNA Server version 2.11.sp1 compact disc.

The files: Ibmtdlc.sys and Snatdlc.dll are not copied into the \Sna\System
directory from the \Sna\System\Hwsetup\Ibmtdlc directory.

NOTE: This does not occur with other link services, such as the Andrew Twinax
Link service or the Barr SDLC Link service.

WORKAROUND
==========

Either copy the Ibmtdlc.sys and Snatdlc.dll files into the \Sna\System directory
or remove and reinstall the IBM Twinax Link Service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11.sp1. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
