-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run the Encarta installer, the Easy Install window indicates one of
three possible options. This article discusses the conditions for each of these
options.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Faster Encarta 96 Encyclopedia (System 7.1 or later)
----------------------------------------------------

This option is listed if the volume (hard drive) to which you are installing has
more than 16 MB of available hard drive space. This is the default and optimal
way to install Encarta on your Macintosh.

Slower Encarta 96 Encyclopedia (System 7.1 or later)
----------------------------------------------------

This option is listed if the volume to which you are installing has between 11 MB
and 15 MB of available hard drive space. In this situation, the installer will
not install the Data Files folder on to the hard drive, which will remain on the
CD-ROM.

The volume named "<hard drive name>" does not have enough space available
to install Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.

This option is listed if the volume to which you are installing has less than 11
MB of available hard drive space. Although you can click Customize to select
items to install, this is not recommended. If possible, you should quit the
installer and make more space available on the hard drive.
