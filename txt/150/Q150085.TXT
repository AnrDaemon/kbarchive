TITLE   :XCLN: AutoSignature and multiple users on same machine
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When there are multiple users on one computer and one of them sets up an
autosignature, the text of that autosignature will be applied to every mail
message sent from that computer, not just the mail sent by the user who created
the autosignature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. Autotext.sig is stored in the Windows subdirectory, not in
the profile. Therefore, it will affect every user.

WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround is to create an autosignature for every user's profile and have
the user select the desired autosignature. The autosignature that the user
selects will be their default.
