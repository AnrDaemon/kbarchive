SYMPTOMS
========

If the TabStop property of a control is set to False and the focus is set to
that control at run-time, and if another window in the same application or a
different application is activated, when the focus is set back to the original
window, the control no longer has the focus.

RESOLUTION
==========

Temporarily set the TabStop property to True in the GotFocus event, and set it
back to False in the LostFocus event. If the user changes over to another
application or window while the control has the focus, the focus returns to the
original control when the window is activated. For example, if, at the beginning
of the program, the Text1 control was not going to have the focus, the following
code could be inserted in the GotFocus and LostFocus events of the Text
control:

      Private Sub Text1_GotFocus()
         Text1.TabStop = True
         End Sub
         Private Sub Text1_LostFocus()
         Text1.TabStop = False
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place two Text boxes on Form1.

3. Set the TabStop property of the Text1 text box to False.

4. Run the project by pressing F5. Note that the Text2 text box has the focus
   when the form appears. Click on the Text1 text box, and then click on any
   other window in the Desktop, or press ALT+TAB to switch to another
   application.

5. Return the focus to Form1 by clicking on its Title bar or by pressing
   ALT+TAB. Note that the Text2 text box has the focus.

To work around this problem, place the code in the Workaround Section above into
the code for Form1.
