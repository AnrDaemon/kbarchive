SUMMARY

This article describes how to remove divers' licenses from Magic School Bus.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove one or more divers' licenses, use the appropriate steps below for your
version of Windows:

Windows 95/98
-------------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

2. Select the drive on which Magic School Bus has been installed. This is
   usually drive C.

3. For Magic School Bus Oceans, do the following:

   a. Click the plus sign next to the MSKids folder.

   b. Select the MSBOcean folder.

   For Magic School Bus Earth, do the following:

   a. Double-click the Program Files folder.

   b. Double-click the Microsoft Kids folder.

   c. Click the MSB Earth folder.

4. On the File menu, click New, and then click Folder.

5. Type "test" (without the quotation marks), then press ENTER.

6. On the View menu, click Arrange Icons, and then click by Name.

7. On the View menu, click Details.

8. Double-click the Windows\System folder.

9. Look for the first set of three files whose names begin with bd#####.gvd and
   end with bd#####.pag or bd#####.str (where ##### is a series of matching
   numbers). For example:

   bd32101.gvd
   bd32101.pag
   bd32101.str

   NOTE: If you see a file that begins with bd#####.gvd and is followed by
   another file with a three letter file extension of .gvd, continue to search
   until you find a group of two or three of them together.

10. Select the first of the files.

11. Press and hold down SHIFT, then click the file bd#####.str (where #####
   matches the numbers in the file highlighted in step 11). This selects all
   three files.

12. With the right mouse button, click any of the highlighted files, and then
   click Cut.

13. With the right mouse button, click the Test folder, and then click Paste.

14. Leave Windows Explorer open.

15. Return to Magic School Bus by selecting it on the Windows taskbar. When you
   get to the divers license and click Load, is the correct divers license
   gone? If not, close Magic School Bus.

16. Select Windows Explorer on the Windows taskbar, and then click the Test
   folder.

17. Click the first file in the Test folder. Hold down SHIFT, and then click the
   last file in the Test folder.

18. With the right mouse button, click any of the highlighted files, and then
   click Cut.

19. With the right mouse button, click the System folder, and then click Paste.

20. Go to the next set of two to three bd#####.* files. Follow steps 10-16.

21. Once you have determined that the correct divers license is gone, return to
   Windows Explorer.

22. With the right mouse button, click the Test folder, and then click Delete.

23. If you are prompted to confirm the folder deletion, click Yes.

Windows 3.x

2. Make sure you are viewing the files on the hard drive on which the program is
   installed (typically C:\).

3. Double-click the MSKids folder.

4. Double-click the MSBOcean folder for Oceans or MSBEarth for Earth.

5. On the File menu, click Create Directory.

6. Type "Test" (without the quotation marks) in the box next to Name, then click
   OK.

7. On the View menu, click Sort by Name.

8. Double-click the System directory.

9. Look for the first set of three files whose names begin with bd#####.gvd and
   end with bd#####.pag or bd#####.str (where ##### is a series of matching
   numbers). For example:

   bd32101.gvd
   bd32101.pag
   bd32101.str

   NOTE: If you see a file that begins with bd#####.gvd and is followed by
   another file with a three letter file extension of .gvd, continue to search
   until you find a group of two or three of them together.

10. Select the first of the files.

11. Press and hold down SHIFT, then click the file bd#####.str (where #####
   matches the numbers in the file highlighted in step 11.) This selects all
   three files.

12. With the files selected, drag them to the new Test directory.

13. Run Magic School bus. When you get to the divers license and choose Load, is
   the correct divers license gone?

14. If not, exit Magic School Bus and return to File Manager.

15. Double-click the Test directory.

16. Select the first file in the Test directory. Hold down the SHIFT key while
   you select the last file in the Test directory.

17. Drag those files back into the System directory below Magic School Bus.

18. Go to the next set of two to three bd#####.* files. Follow steps 11-14,
   above.

19. Once you have determined that the correct diver's license is gone, return to
   File Manager.

21. On the File menu, click Delete. Click OK in the Delete dialog box.

22. Click Yes To All in the Confirm File Delete dialog box.
