======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 without using the Bookshelf
Setup, the Setup Add/Remove option does not accurately report the Internet
Explorer 2.0 installation status.

For example, if you do a "Typical" Bookshelf installation, Internet Explorer is
not installed. Later, when you click on an Internet reference in Bookshelf, you
are asked if you want to install Internet Explorer. If you install it and later
run Bookshelf Setup, Setup searches for "installed components" and then
indicates Internet Explorer 2.0 is not installed.

STATUS
======

This behavior does not indicate a problem with Bookshelf or Internet Explorer,
and will not cause a problem if you install Internet Explorer again from
Bookshelf Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internet Explorer has its own Setup program. Unless Bookshelf Setup is used to
start Internet Explorer Setup, the program does not show as an Bookshelf
Setup-installed component.
