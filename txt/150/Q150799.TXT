The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


In Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1, the Package Definition File
(PDF) parser detects only the following strings for Windows NT for the Supported
Platforms entry:

   Windows NT 3.1 (x86)
   Windows NT 3.1 (MIPS)
   Windows NT 3.1 (Alpha)

In Systems Management Server version 1.2, the following strings can be specified
in the PDF file for Windows NT:

   Windows NT 3.5 (x86)
   Windows NT 3.5 (MIPS)
   Windows NT 3.5 (Alpha)
   Windows NT 3.51 (x86)
   Windows NT 3.51 (MIPS)
   Windows NT 3.51 (Alpha)
   Windows NT 4.0 (x86)
   Windows NT 4.0 (MIPS)
   Windows NT 4.0 (Alpha)
   Windows NT (x86)
   Windows NT (MIPS)
   Windows NT (Alpha)

The Systems Management Server Administrator UI displays only the following
generic entries:

   Windows NT (x86)
   Windows NT (MIPS)
   Windows NT (Alpha)

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server does no version checking when jobs are sent. Although
an operating system version can be specified in the PDF, when the PDF is
imported into a package, the Supported Platform selection is mapped to the
corresponding generic option.

STATUS
======

This is by product design.
