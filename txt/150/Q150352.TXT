======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores Inside the Earth for Windows, version 1.0 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you quit Magic School Bus Explores the Earth (MSB Earth), you may notice
that some of the non-maximized windows of currently running applications are
resized or maximized.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps describe a workaround for this problem:

1. Open the Bus Stop Utility for MSB Earth (which is located in the "Bus Help -
   Earth" Help program in the troubleshooting section).

   For information on how to open the Bus Stop Utility for MSB Earth, please see
   the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q151436 MSB Earth: Where Is the Bus Stop Utility

2. Click the button marked "Ask whether to change to 640x480" so that a green
   dot appears on top of the orange button.

3. Click Exit.

4. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Kids, and then click Magic
   School Bus - Earth.

5. Click No when the following message appears:

   For better picture quality we recommend that you switch screen resolution to
   640 x 480 pixels. Would you like to change screen resolution to 640 x 480
   pixels now?

The main program screen will now appear in the center of your monitor, surrounded
by a black background. When you quit the program the non- maximized windows of
currently running applications will not be resized or maximized.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior only occurs when running MSB Earth for Windows, version 1.0, on
Windows 95. This problem does not occur with the other Magic School Bus titles,
or if you are running MSB Earth on Windows 3.1 or 3.11.
