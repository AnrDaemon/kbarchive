TITLE   :BUG: FOR4280 Warning Given for Unused Result Variables
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The compiler erroneously gives the following warning message for unused function
result variables: warning FOR4280: unused local variable <name>

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Function result variables are not local variables. Therefore, the compiler
should not generate the FOR4280 warning message for unused function result
variables.

When compiling the sample code provided, the compiler issues two warning
messages: warning FOR4280: unused local variable R

   -and-

   warning FOR4290: function FUNC has not been pointer assigned nor allocated

The first compiler message is the incorrect FOR4280 warning message. However, the
second message is correct as FUNC expects to return a pointer to an integer but
R has no storage space allocated to it.

Sample Code to Illustrate Problem
---------------------------------

   ! Compile options needed: /c

         module mod
         contains
             function func() result(r)
             integer, pointer :: r
             end function func
         end module mod
