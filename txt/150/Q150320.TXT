KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Bookshelf '96-'97 from a UNC network path to a computer using
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.x, you receive the following error
message:

   Bad Argument Value. STOP.
   Bad Argument Value:
   Number 1
   File: .\path.c, Line: 392
   <OK>

After you click OK, you see the following message:

   Setup Message!
   Could not open the file named:
   '<UNC Path>'.
   <Abort>,<Retry><Ignore>

If you click Ignore, Bookshelf appears to install successfully, but some features
of the program, such as sound in animations with audio, do not work correctly.

NOTE: A UNC network path is a path specifying a particular network server and
share. For example:

   \\Bookshelf\Install\Setup.exe.

Compare this to using a standard drive connection, such as:

   D:\Setup.exe.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the Bookshelf program files, if installed, and run Setup from a local
CD-ROM drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bookshelf '96-'97 Setup is not designed to be run from a network drive.
