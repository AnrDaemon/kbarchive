The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Exchange clients for Windows, it might become necessary
to delete the Microsoft Schedule+ information for your mailbox from the
Microsoft Exchange Server. This article describes the steps required to perform
this operation.

CREATING A BACKUP OF YOUR SCHEDULE
----------------------------------

Before deleting your schedule, you may want to save your schedule data to a text
file. This can be done by exporting the data to the Schedule+ Interchange (.SC2)
format.

1. Select File/Export/Schedule+ Interchange.

2. Choose the path and filename of the export file.

3. Select any other options and press OK.

If problems occur while clearing your schedule, you can import the .SC2 file to
restore your original schedule information.

DELETING THE SCHEDULE+ DATA
---------------------------

1. Start the Microsoft Schedule+ client while holding down the CTRL and SHIFT
   keys.

2. You will receive the dialog box:

   You have launched Schedule+ with the CTRL and SHIFT keys held down.

   If you continue, Schedule+ will clear your schedule data. A backup copy of the
   data will be saved in your Windows directory.

   Are you sure you want to clear your schedule data?

3. Choose YES to continue with the operation.

This will cause a backup file, _schd01.bak to appear in your Windows directory.

If you do not see the warning dialog box, then Schedule+ did not recognize that
the keys Ctrl + Shift were being pressed. Try launching Schedule+ by double
clicking on the file SCHDPLS32.EXE while simultaneously pressing the Control and
Shift keys.

NOTE: There cannot be an existing session opened by either Microsoft Exchange or
Microsoft Schedule+. If there is an open session, the CTRL+SHIFT has no effect
when starting Microsoft Schedule+.
