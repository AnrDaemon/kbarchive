TITLE   :BUG: PEEKCHARQQ Fails in QuickWin or Standard Graphics Program
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbFortranPS kbLangFortran

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran Powerstation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the PEEKCHARQQ() run-time function to check the keystroke buffer for
keyboard characters will fail, causing .false. to be returned as the function's
result.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Using the sample code listed below, create a QuickWin or Standard Graphics
   application.

2. Run the application. Running the application causes the message "Press any
   key to exit" to be displayed 100 times. Then the application quits.

NOTE: Pressing any key does not halt the application because PEEKCHARQQ() always
returns .false. in a QuickWin or Standard Graphics program.

Sample Code
-----------

   ! Compile options needed: /MW or /MWs

         INCLUDE 'FLIB.FI'
         INCLUDE 'FLIB.FD'

         INTEGER COUNT
         LOGICAL DONE

         COUNT = 0
         DONE = .FALSE.

   10    DO WHILE( (.NOT. DONE) .AND. (COUNT .LT. 100) )
            WRITE(*, *) 'Press any key to exit'
            IF ( PEEKCHARQQ() ) THEN
               DONE = .TRUE.
               GOTO 10
            END IF
            COUNT = COUNT + 1
         END DO
         WRITE(*,*) 'Program terminated...'
         END
