SYMPTOMS
========

When using the localized Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows with Double- Byte
Character Sets (DBCS), printing problems occur when printing on various printers
with various fonts. This problem only occurs on Windows 95.


The problem has been reproduced with all Japanese Fonts. The problem does not
occur with the United States (US) version of Visual Basic 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace the Command_Click event code with the code shown below. This code works
to address the problem:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
         ' Workaround.
         x = printer.currentx
         y = printer.currenty
         printer.print
         printer.currentx = x
         printer.currenty = y

         printer.fontname = "?l?r ?S?V?b?N"
         printer.fontsize = 48
         printer.print "? ? ? ? ? "
         printer.enddoc
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Japanese version of Visual
Basic version 4.0 for Windows 95. This may be an issue with other localized
versions of Visual Basic 4.0. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in the Japanese version of Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is
   created by default.

2. Add a command button to Form1.

3. Add the following code to the Command1_Click event:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            printer.fontname = "?l?r ?S?V?b?N"
            printer.fontsize = 48
            printer.print "? ? ? ? ? "
            printer.enddoc
