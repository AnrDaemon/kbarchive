SYMPTOMS
========


When you start the Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 Help file from the SMS shared
application program group on a Windows NT client, you receive the following
error message:

   Executing winhelp.exe rather than winhlp32.exe because this help file uses a
   16 bit DLL (178)

The message occurs when Winhlp32 is asked to open any 16-bit Help file.

CAUSE
=====

Program Group Control (PGC) is designed to use file associations. A command line
such as "Wdreadme.hlp" causes PGC to run the program associated with the .hlp
extension and to look for the target file in the package directory. Under
Windows NT, .hlp files are associated with Winhlp32.exe. Winhlp32 recognizes
16-bit Help files and warns the user that it is going to run Winhelp.exe.
