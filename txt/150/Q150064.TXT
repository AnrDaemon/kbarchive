=======

In Visual SourceSafe, you can branch a specific version of a project. This
article shows by example how to do it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Branching a specific version of a project in Visual SourceSafe is slightly
different from the way it was accomplished in previous versions of SourceSafe.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, select the project you want to branch from
   by right-clicking on it and then click Show History.

2. In the Project History dialog box, select the recursive option if all
   subprojects and their files are wanted. Click OK.

3. Select the version, and click the Share button.

4. Select the project in which you want to create the new branch, then select
   the Branch After Share check box in the lower-left corner of the Share From
   dialog. Click OK.

5. In the Share dialog box, type the name you want to give to the new branch and
   check the recursive checkbox if you want to branch subprojects. Click OK.
