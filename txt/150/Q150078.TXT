TITLE   :MIFWIN Does Not Open Form Specified
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you send out a new form to the client there is no way to specify the new
form as the default form. Running MIFWIN "formname" does not bring up the
specified form.

CAUSE
=====

MIFWIN does not accept command line parameters. Therefore, the form name passed
to it is ignored.

RESOLUTION
==========

MIFWIN loads the forms in alphabetical order. Naming the new form with a name
that comes after the client's other forms, alphabetically, will bring the new
form up as the default form. For example, if the client has a form named
uninfo.xnf, sending out new form with the name tnewform.xnf will bring up the
new form as the default form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
