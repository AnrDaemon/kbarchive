The SMS Inventory Agent will not inventory packages or collect files that are on
compressed drives.

If you create an inventory package for a file that exists on the compressed drive
of a client computer, the inventory agent indicates that it is searching all
drives when it runs. However, the package is not found and is not added to the
Software group in Personal Computer properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. It has been fixed in Systems Management Server version 1.2.
