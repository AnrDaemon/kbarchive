SYMPTOMS
========

Your personal folders (.pst) file may not reduce in size after you delete
messages in Microsoft Exchange.

CAUSE
=====

In order for a .pst file to be compressed automatically, the following
conditions must be met:

 - Microsoft Exchange must be running.

 - The amount of recoverable space must be at least four percent of the total
   size of the .pst file.

 - There must be idle processor time. You may need to disable your screen saver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To reduce the size of a .pst file manually, follow these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Exchange.

2. On the Tools menu, click Services.

3. Click Personal Folders, click Properties, and then click Compact Now.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Personal Address Book (.pab) files are not compacted when you remove addresses
from your address book. There is no way to manually compact these files.
However, free space in these files is reused when you add new addresses.
