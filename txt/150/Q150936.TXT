SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Visual C++ integrated debugger fails to stop at the breakpoints it

CAUSE
=====

when a file in the project or a subdirectory in the path to the project uses

The problem became more apparent on upgrading to Visual C++ version 4.1.

patch can be found in the Microsoft Software Library as file VC41A.EXE.
