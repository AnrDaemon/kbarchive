TITLE   :BUG: LOADIMAGE() or LOADIMAGE_W() Graphics Functions Can Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Fortran Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbFortranPS kbLangFortrankbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the LOADIMAGE() or LOADIMAGE_W() graphics functions to display a bitmap
file (.bmp) having 256 or more colors or containing complex graphics images
fails in a QuickWin or Standard Graphics application.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either use bitmaps having no more than 256 colors or use less complex bitmap
images.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a source file that contains the sample code listed below.

2. Copy any 256-color or greater bitmap file (.bmp) to the directory containing
   the sample code.

3. Modify the sample code to include the 256-color or greater bitmap file name
   in the LOADIMAGE_W() function.

4. Compile and run the application.

Sample Code
-----------

   ! Compile options needed: /MW
         include 'FGRAPH.FI'
         include 'FGRAPH.FD'
         integer*4 i
         i=LOADIMAGE_W('winnt256.bmp',0,0)
         if( i .ne. 0 ) print *, 'LoadImage failed'
         end
