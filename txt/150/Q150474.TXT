TITLE   :Accessing an Access Database Through GSNW May Hang Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Microsoft Access database located on a Novell NetWare server
through a Windows NT Server running Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW), the
database may appear to stop responding (hang) when you close it.

This problem does not occur if the database is located on the Windows NT Server
or if the clients directly access the database on the NetWare Server by using
Client Services for NetWare (CSNW).

CAUSE
=====

When an Access database is shared between several users, it is normal for a lock
violation to occur on the locked database file (.LDB) when you close the
database. This lock violation is normally reported to the client; however, when
this occurs through GSNW, GSNW waits indefinitely for the lock to clear.
Eventually the client times out and closes the session to GSNW.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add the following value to the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer \Parameters

Value: LockViolationDelay
Type: REG_DWORD
Data: 0

This effectively turns off the lock violation optimisation within the Windows NT
Server and causes all lock violations to fail immediately.
