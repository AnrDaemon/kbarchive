SUMMARY
=======

When you use User Manager in Windows NT, certain options (such as Logon Hours)
cannot be set for groups, but can be set for individual users. This article
explains how to set these options for multiple users at one time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To select multiple users in a domain and set options for those users, select the
first user you want to apply the option to, hold the Shift key, and select the
last user you want to apply the option to. Also, you can press the Control key
to select or cancel the selection of individual user accounts.

Once the user accounts that you want to modify are selected, click Users, select
Properties, and change the setting; this will apply to all selected users.

This procedures can be used to change the following settings:

 - User must change password at next logon

 - Users cannot change password

 - Passwords never expire

 - Account disabled

 - Group membership (can add/remove users from groups)

 - Set the path for user profiles, home directories and logon scripts

 - Set logon hours

 - Set workstations that users can logon from

 - Set account expiration and account type (global or local)

Note that this procedure can produce a known issue. If one of the users selected
has the "User Must Change Password at Next Logon" check box selected, the check
box is cleared after changes are made to the user's properties. For additional
