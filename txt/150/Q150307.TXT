KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing network support, if you select the Novell NetWare
(Workstation Shell 3.x [Netx]) or the Novell NetWare (Workstation Shell 4.0 and
later [VLM]) network client and then open the properties for the network
adapter, the Real-Mode (16-Bit) ODI Drivers option is selected properly, but the
Enhanced-Mode (32-Bit And 16-Bit) NDIS Driver and the Real-Mode (16-Bit) NDIS
Driver options are not disabled.

Because the Real-Mode (16-Bit) ODI Driver option is the only valid option, it
should be the only option available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you select the Enhanced-Mode (32-Bit And 16-Bit) NDIS Driver or the Real-Mode
(16-Bit) NDIS Driver option with the Novell NetWare (Workstation Shell 3.x
[Netx]) or the Novell NetWare (Workstation Shell 4.0 and later [VLM]) network
client, Windows 95 may stop responding (hang) or may become unstable.
