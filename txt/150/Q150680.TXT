SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a Web, you may receive the error message

   Timed out while trying to connect to a server at <xxxxx> on port 80.

where <xxxxx> is a number representing the Internet Protocol (IP) address.

CAUSE
=====

The network is attempting to resolve the numeric value as an IP address rather
than as the server name.

This behavior is due to how host names are resolved. For example, if the host
name you are trying to resolve is numeric, the network may assume that the name
is actually an IP address; therefore, the host name is not converted to an IP
address. The network will time out attempting to reach this non-existent IP
address.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Use the 127.0.0.1 IP Address
--------------------------------------

Use the loopback IP Address (127.0.0.1) as the name of the computer you are
trying to access. This reserved IP address corresponds to your local computer.

Method 2: Use Localhost
-----------------------

Use "localhost" (without the quotation marks) as the name of the computer you are
trying to access. This reserved host name also corresponds to your local
computer.

Method 3: Use at Least One Alphabetical Character
-------------------------------------------------

Rename the host computer so that it includes at least one alphabetical
character.
