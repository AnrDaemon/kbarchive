SUMMARY
=======

Windows 95 includes a telephony utility that can be run from Control Panel, but
is not available by default. The telephony utility can be used for
troubleshooting telephony-related issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add the Telephony icon to Control Panel, rename Telephon.cp$ in the
Windows\System folder to Telephon.cpl, and then restart Control Panel.

If you have a 16-bit Telephony application programming interface (TAPI) service
provider already installed on your computer when you upgrade to Windows 95, you
may experience problems with your 32-bit communication applications (such as
HyperTerminal, Phone Dialer, and Dial-Up Networking).

You can use the Telephony icon in Control Panel to determine if you have a 16-bit
TAPI service provider installed and to remove your 16-bit TAPI service
provider(s) to eliminate problems with 32-bit communication programs. However,
removing your 16-bit TAPI service provider may prevent 16-bit TAPI-aware
programs from functioning properly. If you are having TAPI-related problems,
Microsoft recommends that you rebuild Telephon.ini using the steps outlined in
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q120221 How to Rebuild the TELEPHON.INI File

If you add and run the Telephony utility, you will most likely see the following
telephony driver installed:

   Unimodem Service Provider

This is the Windows 95 32-bit TAPI service provider and should not be removed.
