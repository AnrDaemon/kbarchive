SYMPTOMS
========

CDaoRecordView depends on an instance of CDaoRecordset to display data. The
CDaoRecordView class also needs to stay in synchronization with the current
record displayed by the CDaoRecordset instance. Calling the Seek, MoveFirst,
MoveNext, or other methods directly on the CDaoRecordset being used by a
CDaoRecordView causes the CDaoRecordView to behave incorrectly.

CAUSE
=====

CDaoRecordView uses four member variables to keep track of bookkeeping
information. The first three variables listed below store bookmarks for the
first, last, and current record. The fourth variable is used to enable or
disable the toolbar buttons corresponding to MoveFirst, MovePrev, MoveNext, and
MoveLast.

   m_varBookmarkCurrent
   m_varBookmarkFirst
   m_varBookmarkLast
   m_nStatus

These variables are only maintained when the CDaoRecordView::OnMove method is
invoked. This method invokes the CDaoRecordset MoveFirst, MoveNext,
MovePrevious, or MoveLast methods, and updates the variables. Only OnMove keeps
these variables in synchronization.

The following list contains the more common CDaoRecordset methods that change the
current record:

   - Find            - Move            - Requery
   - FindFirst       - MoveFirst       - Seek
   - FindLast        - MoveLast        - SetAbsolutePosition
   - FindNext        - MoveNext        - SetBookmark
   - FindPrev        - MovePrev        - SetPercentPosition

When the AddNew method is called, a new record is added to the recordset but the
current record bookmark does not change. To change the newly added record to the
current record, use the following method:

      // set the current bookmark to the newly added record
      m_pSet->SetBookmark(GetLastModifiedBookmark());

NOTE: GetLastModifiedBookmark() needs to be called right after the call to
Update() to return the newly added record. Calling it after one of the
recordview MoveXXXX functions returns a bookmark to the record that was current
prior to the move operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

After performing a CDaoRecordset method for an instance utilized by
CDaoRecordView, reset the CDaoRecordView's bookkeeping variables as shown in the
following code:

      if (!m_pSet->Seek(...))
      {
        if( !m_pSet->IsEOF() )
        {
            m_varBookmarkCurrent = 1L;   // <<- re-initialize
            m_varBookmarkFirst =         // <<- the bookmark
               m_varBookmarkLast = 0L;   // <<- member variables!
           // Enable toolbar buttons
           m_nStatus |= AFX_DAOVIEW_SCROLL_BACKWARD;// First & Prev buttons
           m_nStatus |= AFX_DAOVIEW_SCROLL_NEXT;    // next toolbar button
           m_nStatus |= AFX_DAOVIEW_SCROLL_LAST;    // last toolbar button
        }
        else
        {
           // Move to some valid record
        }
     }
     else
     {
        // Seek failed - move to a valid record
     }

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Generate a default AppWizard application named SeekTest, and give it the
   following attributes:

    - Database View without File Support.

    - Select a data source, using DAO and a Table recordset type.

    - Open the Student Registration database (STDREG32.MDB) on the SECTION
      table.

2. Using the Resource View, add several text boxes to the IDD_SEEKTEST_FORM
   dialog resource that appears. Use the CTRL-DBLCLK short-cut to bind columns
   in SECTION to the dialog resource.

3. Add a button to the IDD_SEEKTEST_FORM resource. Using ClassWizard, add the
   following code:

         m_pSet->SetCurrentIndex( _T("PrimaryKey") );

         COleVariant varCourse ( _T("MATH201"), VT_BSTRT );
         COleVariant varSection( _T( "1"     ), VT_BSTRT );

         if(! m_pSet->Seek( _T( "=" ), &varCourse, &varSection ) )
         {
             // Seek failed - need to move to a valid record
             m_pSet->MoveFirst();
         }
         UpdateData( FALSE );

4. Compile, build, and run the program.

5. Click the MoveNext (>) button and then the MovePrevious (<) button to
   disable the MoveFirst (|<) and MovePrevious (<) toolbar buttons.

6. Click the Seek button. Note that the MoveFirst and MovePrevious buttons are
   still incorrectly disabled.

Adding the code to clear the bookmarks, and resetting the m_nStatus variable
corrects the toolbar and prevents other problems.
