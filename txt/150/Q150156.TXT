SUMMARY

You might receive the following error message when you attempt to send a mail
message from Microsoft Word 6.0c on Windows 3.1 and you are using Netware VLM as
the network protocol:

   Your Microsoft Exchange Server is unavailable.

   You can retry connecting to the server using the network, or work offline and
   connect using dialup networking.

   The operation could not be completed due to insufficient memory. Close one or
   more applications to make more memory available.
