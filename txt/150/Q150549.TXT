PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbvfp300 kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the 16-bit Oracle 7 ODBC driver (Sqora7.dll version 1.11.0000) that
ships with Visual FoxPro to connect to an Oracle 7 server, the connection fails
with the following error message:

   Connectivity Error [Microsoft][ODBC DLL] Driver's SQLSetConnectOption failed

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because there are a lot of files (programs, projects, tables,
and so on) open in Visual FoxPro when you attempt to establish a connection to
the Oracle server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close some of the files prior to making the connection to the Oracle server.
This problem does not occur in the 32-bit Oracle 7 driver provided by Visigenic
Corporation.

NOTE: As of 12/9/98, Visigenic Corporation has been acquired by INPRISE, Inc.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open several program files in Visual FoxPro. The actual number may vary, but
   typically between eight and ten files reproduces the error.

2. Type the following command in the Command window:

         ?SQLConnect()

3. Choose the ODBC data source for the Oracle server, and click OK.

   A -1 is displayed on the Visual FoxPro desktop, indicating that the connection
   failed. To see the actual error message, type the following commands in the
   Command window:

         ?AError(aerrs)
         DISPLAY MEMORY LIKE aerrs

   The text of the error message is displayed on the Visual FoxPro desktop.
