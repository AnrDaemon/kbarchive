SUMMARY
=======

The third page in chapter 4 of the Microsoft Exchange Installation Guide
states:

   To set up a client install point:

   1. Run SETUP.EXE on the Microsoft Exchange Client CD-ROM in the \CLIENTS
   subdirectory.

This should reference the \ENG subdirectory, not the \CLIENTS subdirectory.

NOTE: This process is similar to just copying the appropriate subdirectory to a
network share and letting the users run the Microsoft Exchange Client Setup from
there.
