======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click OK in the Directory Replication dialog box, one of the following
STOP messages appears:

   The system cannot find the file specified.

   The device or directory does not exist.

CAUSE
=====

The first error can occur if the registry parameters ExportPath and/or
ImportPath contain an invalid path entry, for instance a nonexistent directory.

The second error can occur if the registry parameters ExportPath and/or
ImportPath contain an invalid drive entry.

An invalid ExportPath can cause the error even if the computer is not configured
as an export computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Edit the following HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree registry entries:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator\Parameters
       \ExportPath

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator\Parameters
       \ImportPath

Make sure that ExportPath and ImportPath point to valid drives and directories.

Close the Registry Editor and restart the computer.
