The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to plot a file using AutoCAD R13 under Windows NT, the following
error message appears:

   Error writing to LPTx the device is not ready

CAUSE
=====

Autocad defaults to its own AUTOSPOOL feature, which requires the LPT port to be
free. If you already have a printer defined in Print Manager to print to that
port, you may get the above error.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can configure AutoCAD to plot directly to the default printer set in Print
Manager by configuring AutoCAD for System Printer ADI. The System Printer and
System Printer Settings can be changed. In the Plot dialog box, open the Device
and Default selection dialog box and use the Change Device Requirements.
