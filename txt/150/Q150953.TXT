SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Novell NetWare Windows utility, Nwuser.exe, to send messages to
and from Novell clients, the message is truncated to approximately 38 characters
(NWUSER permits up to 255 characters.) This behavior is different than the
Novell DOS client's Send.exe utility, which permits only up to 55 characters.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

After you apply the fix, perform the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\FPNW\Parameters

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

4. Add the following value:

   Value Name: MaxNcpMessageLength
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 0 (default), 1, or 250 (maximum)

   NOTE: If you set the value to 0, you get the limit of 55. If you set the limit
   to 1, you get a limit of 1 character messages. If you set the limit to 250,
   you get the limit of 250 character messages.

5. Click OK and then quit Registry Editor.
