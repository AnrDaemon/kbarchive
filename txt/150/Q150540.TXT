======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you load File and Print Service for NetWare (FPNW) on a domain controller, it
must be loaded on the primary domain controller (PDC) to have full
functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When FPNW is loaded on a backup domain controller (BDC), but not on the PDC,
FPNW will not be able to create the directories which hold the NetWare
compatible login scripts.

When you create a user account and set it to maintain a NetWare compatible login,
the object ID is assigned, but the default directory SysVol\Mail\[objectID] is
not created. Also, the Edit Login Script button is grayed out.

Once FPNW is loaded on the PDC, the functionality will be there for future users
created on the BDC. The SysVol\Mail\[objectID] directory is created on the PDC.

Users may want to set up directory replication to ensure the login scripts are
updated from the PDC to the BDC(s). If the FPNW service is stopped on the PDC,
the functionality (creating the directory) on the BDC will again be lost.

This situation is by design. When using FPNW on a domain controller, User Manager
points to the domain, not a single server. FPNW is emulating a single server
configuration, but when loaded on a domain controller it is actually in a
multiserver environment.
