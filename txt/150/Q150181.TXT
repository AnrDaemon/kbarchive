SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Move method of the Spin control, the control may not move if it
is invisible.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, issue the Move command twice. For example, instead
of writing:

      SpinButton1.Move 0,0,200,200

use the following code to move the control if it is invisible:

      SpinButton1.Move 0,0,200,200
      SpinButton1.Move 0,0,200,200

If the size of the control remains unchanged, the command only needs to be issued
once.

Steps To Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place an OutRider SpinButton control on the form. From the Tools menu, select
   the Custom Controls menu option, and then select the Outrider SpinButton.

3. In the Form_Click event, place the following code:

      Private Sub Form_Click()

      SpinButton1.Visible = False

      SpinButton1.Move 0, 0, 200, 200

      SpinButton1.Visible = True

      End Sub

Run the program by pressing F5, and notice that the control re-sizes but does not
move to the upper left hand corner of the client area of the Form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In general, this problem is encountered when the size and the position of the
control are adjusted. If the size of the control is not adjusted by the Move
command, the control will move correctly.
