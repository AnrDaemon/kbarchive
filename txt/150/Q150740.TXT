TITLE   :XCLN: DocErr: Client Floppy Install Instructions are Wrong
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Readme.wri in the root directory of the Microsoft Exchange Client Software
CD instructs users who want to set up the Microsoft Exchange client from floppy
disks to copy each disk subdirectory from the floppy directory on the CD to a
floppy diskette. This is incorrect. There is no floppy directory on the CD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The correct method for creating client installation disks is listed in the
Installation Guide. Those steps are as follows:

1. On the Microsoft Exchange Client Software CD, change to the directory for the
   language and platform desired.

2. Copy each file with a .CAB extension onto a separate floppy disk, numbering
   the disks with the same number as the .CAB file.

3. Copy the remaining files, except Template.prf, onto Disk 1 (containing
   Exchng1.cab).

4. Be sure to copy Default.prf to Disk 1 if it exists.
