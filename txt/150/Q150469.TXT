SUMMARY
=======

This article corrects a documentation error in the code sample for the RowTop
Method described in the "Visual Basic 4.0 Language Reference," and online Help.
When you execute the sample code, an "Expected End of Statement" error occurs
and the following line of code is highlighted:

      CellTop = DataGrid1.RowTop RowValue + Y - DY / 2

This error occurs because the RowValue argument for the RowTop method is not
enclosed in parentheses.

To correct this error, enclose the RowValue argument in parentheses as in the
following example:

      CellTop = DataGrid1.RowTop(RowValue) + Y - DY / 2

STATUS
======

This documentation error was corrected in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 3.
