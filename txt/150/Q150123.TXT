The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard to migrate Microsoft Mail
users to Microsoft Exchange, you have the option to migrate Microsoft Schedule+
files. After the migration is completed and your users log into Microsoft
Schedule+ 7.0 for the first time, they will be prompted for a password. This is
the password from the cal file that was on the PC Mail Postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

The 1.0 cal file contains a password. When Microsoft Schedule+ information is
migrated, this password is merged into the Pub.edb file. Users will only be
prompted for this password the first time they log into Microsoft Schedule+.

RESOLUTION
==========

You need to confirm that all of your users know their password before migrating
them.

For information about how to perform a manual migration, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
