SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to import sounds into 3D Movie Maker.

You can import sounds from certain types of sound files into 3D Movie Maker for
use in your current movie. You can import sounds that are in the following
formats:

 - Waveform (.wav)

 - MIDI (.mid)

You can also import sounds contained in other 3D Movie Maker movies (provided
that the sound you are trying to import is not one of the sounds included in 3D
Movie Maker):

 - 3D Movie Maker (.3mm)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sound Effect, Dialog, or Music from File
----------------------------------------

To import a sound from a Wave (.wav) or MIDI (.mid) file to be used as a sound
effect, dialog, or as background music:

1. Open the movie into which you want to insert the sound.

2. Make sure you are in the Studio.

3. Click the Sounds tool (so you can see the Sound Effects, Speech, and Music
   buttons).

4. To import a Wave file as a sound effect, click the Sound Effects button (the
   button that looks like a horn).

   -or-

   To import a Wave file as dialog, click the Speech button (the button that
   looks like a pair of lips).

   -or-

   To import a .mid file, click the Music button (the button that looks like a
   treble clef).

5. Click the Find (Sound Effects/Dialog/Music) button in the lower left corner.
   (The button that looks like the Portfolio button).

6. Use the dialog box to locate the .wav or .mid file you want to use and click
   its name.

7. Click OK. The Sound Effects/Speech/Music list for your current movie appears,
   and the new sound is added to the end of the list.

8. Click the sound effect/dialog/music item you want to use and then click OK.

9. To apply the sound to an actor, prop, 3D word, or background, click the
   appropriate object.

Sound Effect, Dialog, or Music from Another 3D Movie Maker Movie
----------------------------------------------------------------

To import a sound from another movie to use as a sound effect, dialog, or as
background music:

1. Follow steps 1-5 above, then:

2. Use the dialog box to locate the 3D Movie Maker movie in which the sound is
   stored, and click its name.

3. Click OK. A list of available imported and recorded Sound
   Effects/Speech/Music in that movie appears.

4. Click the sound effect/dialog/music item you want to use (a short preview
   plays) and then press OK.

5. To apply the sound to an actor, prop, 3D word, or background, click the
   appropriate object.

NOTES:

 - When you import a sound from another movie, you are only given the list of
   sounds that match the type of sound you chose to import (that is, if you
   choose to import a Sound Effect, you will only be given The Sound Effect
   sounds).

 - 3D Movie Maker is not capable of importing or playing .mid files in RMI
   format.

 - You have the option to record sounds using the utilities supplied with your
   sound card or with Windows 95 (that is, Sound Recorder). You can import
   sounds saved as .wav files into any movie and save them as part of that
   movie. In 3D Movie Maker, .wav files are used for speech and sound effects.
   You also can use these sounds in other applications that support .wav files.
