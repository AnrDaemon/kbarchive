TITLE   :Cannot Access Exchange Server After Changing WinNT Domain Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change a Windows NT domain name and then attempt to run the Microsoft
Exchange Server administration tools, you will get a message that the Microsoft
Exchange Server cannot be located. The Microsoft Exchange Server will be
inaccessible by all other means as well.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Server services must log on to the Windows NT server on
which they're running. If the service has been configured in Control Panel under
Services to "Log On As" a specific domain account, the service may be trying to
start as OldDomainName\AccountName instead of NewDomainName\AccountName.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the "Log On As" account setup in Control Panel under Services for all the
Microsoft Exchange Server services. Other services such as Directory Replicator
may also need to be modified because they log on to the server with a domain
account.
