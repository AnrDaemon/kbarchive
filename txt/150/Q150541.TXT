The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you install Powershute software from American Power Conversion (APC) on a
Windows NT computer, the uninterruptable power supply (UPS) icon in Control
Panel is replaced with an icon from APC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

APC supplies Remove.exe to remove the APC program and icon. The Windows NT UPS
tool and icon are not restored. To restore the UPS tool and icon, perform the
following steps;

1. Run the Remove.exe program to remove the Powershute software.

2. Expand the UPS.CP_ file from the Windows NT CD and copy it to the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 directory. This step is necessary even if the file is
   currently on the hard disk drive, because the Powershute software file needs
   to be replaced.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
3. Save the following registry key to disk:
