The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a link to a web page, the text in the web page is displayed;
however, any images on the page are not displayed. Also, you will be prompted
for your user name and password over and over, until you are denied access.

CAUSE
=====

You do not have rights to where the image files are stored on the computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

Check the following:

 - Is IIS is using Basic or NT Challenge/Response password authentication?

   If yes, add Allow Anonymous password authentication.

 - Is the wwwroot directory is on an NTFS partition? With the group EVERYONE
   removed?

   If yes, add the EVERYONE group to where the image files are located.

 - Are the images used by the server stored in a different directory than the
   HTML pages? With the group EVERYONE removed?

   If yes, make sure the same user/group that has access to the HTML directories
   also has rights to where the images are stored on the server.
