TITLE   :ActiveX Developers Kit CD-ROM SP Hangs Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack (SP) 4 from the Microsoft ActiveX
Developers Kit compact disc, the files NTbackup.dll and NTdll.dll are not copied
correctly and the system stops responding.

When you run Update.exe for SP4, the following file copy errors are returned:

   An error has occurred.

   The file %systemroot%\system32\NTBACKUP.EXE was not copied correctly or is not
   a valid Windows NT Image.

and,

   An error has occurred.

   The file %systemroot%\system32\NTDLL.DLL was not copied correctly or is not a
   valid Windows NT Image.

Depending on what Hardware Abstraction Layer your system uses, you may also get a
message such as the following:

   HAL: MPS MP structure not found HAL: No MPS Table Found

   HAL: This HAL.DLL requires an MPS 1.1 system Replace HAL.DLL with the correct
   hal for this system

CAUSE
=====

The file NTdll.dll, which is necessary to start Microsoft Windows NT, is
corrupt. It is likely that both NTbackup.exe and NTdll.dll were not updated, and
that both show the original Windows NT 3.51 dates.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the emergency repair process as documented in Chapter 2 of the Microsoft
Windows NT Installation Guide. You will need to run the "Verify Windows NT
system files" option to recreate the proper operating system file configuration.
This process is also documented in the on-line help files on the NT 3.51
Workstation and Server compact discs under the \support\books subdirectory. You
can also perform an upgrade install of Microsoft Windows NT to recreate a
working operating system configuration. After you have a working installation of
NT 3.51, run Windows NT 3.51 SP4. If your NT installation is on a FAT partition
you can try to manually copy NTdll.dll from a working SP3.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
