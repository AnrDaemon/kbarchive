TITLE   :FIX: Toolbar Button Count Is Wrong if Image Index is Invalid
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp400bug kbVBp500fix kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Count property value of the Toolbar Buttons collection is not correct when a
button without an image is shown on the Toolbar control.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if an Invalid image parameter is used with the Add method
on an ImageList control. The ImageList control supplies the images for the
buttons on the Toolbar control.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a valid Image index number.

-or-

If you want a button to show without an image, trap the error and leave out the
Image parameter in the Add method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the 32-bit edition of Visual Basic 4.0. If it is already running, from
   the File menu, select New Project.

2. Add a Toolbar control, an Image List control, and a Command button to Form1.

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Dim i As Integer
            Dim ImgX As ListImage
            Dim tbButton As Button

            Set ImgX = ImageList1.ListImages.Add(, , _
                    LoadPicture("C:\Visual Basic\Icons\Industry\bicycle.ico"))
            ' Modify the argument for the LoadPicture function to point to
            ' directory containing an icon.

            On Error Resume Next
            Form1.Toolbar1.ImageList = ImageList1

            ' Comment the next line to workaround problem.
            Set tbButton = Form1.Toolbar1.Buttons.Add(1, , "Node1", , 2)

            ' Uncomment one of the following lines to workaround problem.
            ' Uncomment this line if you want the image to appear on the
            ' button.
            ' Set tbButton = Form1.Toolbar1.Buttons.Add(1, , "Node1", , 1)

            ' Uncomment this line if you want a blank button
            ' Set tbButton = Form1.Toolbar1.Buttons.Add(1, , "Node1")
            MsgBox "Number of Buttons according to Count Property: " & _
                    Toolbar1.Buttons.Count

         End Sub

4. On the Run menu, select Start, or press the F5 key. Click the Command button.
   A button appears on the Toolbar but the message box indicates no buttons on
   the Toolbar.
