TITLE   :XADM: Location of Microsoft Exchange Books OnLine
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Books Online files are located on the Microsoft Exchange
Server CD under the directory tree:

   \setup\<platform>\bin

where <platform> is specific to the processor type. The files are
Exchdoc.hlp and Exchdoc.cnt

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note: If you copy the files to your local hard disk, it is important that

   you copy both the .HLP and the .CNT file. The .CNT file is the table of
   contents for the Help file.

There are three ways to access Microsoft Exchange Books Online:

 - You can run them directly from the CD by running the Exchdoc.hlp file. This
   will save Hard Disk space.

 - You can copy them to your local Hard disk and run Exchdoc.hlp.

 - You can install Microsoft Exchange Books Online by running the Microsoft
   Exchange Setup program, selecting add/remove, selecting Exchange, clicking on
   the Change Option button, and checking the help check box. This will copy the
   files to your local hard disk and create an icon called Books Online in the
   Microsoft Exchange group in Program Manager.

For either of the first two options, you do not need to run the Microsoft
Exchange Setup program from the Microsoft Exchange Server CD.
