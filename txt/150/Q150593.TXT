TITLE   :PRB: Syntax Error When You Modify Local View w/ Reserved Words
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a local view to a table, any attempt to modify fields with
Visual FoxPro reserved words for field names results in this error:

   Syntax Error

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when Visual FoxPro attempts to send the modified data to the
source table where the field name is a Visual FoxPro reserved word.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the field in the table to a non-reserved word.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro does not support the use of reserved words as field names in
tables. This behavior does not occur with all reserved words.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new table.

2. Add a field called Value to the table; any data type works.

3. Add some records to the table.

4. Create a local view to the new table.

5. Click the Fields tab, and add the field to the Selected Output list.

6. Click the Update Criteria tab, and set the field to be the Key Field and
   Updatable. Then select the Send SQL Updates check box.

7. Run the view.

8. Modify the data, and move the record pointer. At this point, you receive the
   Syntax Error.

9. Use =TABLEREVERT(.T.) to clear the error.
