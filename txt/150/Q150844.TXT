TITLE   :NetWare Client Buffer-Size Limitation of FPNW Sent Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When in File and Print Services for NetWare, you direct Server Manager to send a
message, only the first 55 characters of the message are received by the Novell
clients; any characters in excess of 55 are not received. Also, sending a
message longer than 55 characters may cause the client computer to stop
responding.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a size limitation in the NetWare client buffer. The
buffer is hard-coded and cannot be tuned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
