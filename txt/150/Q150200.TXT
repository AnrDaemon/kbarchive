PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp400bug kbVBp500fix kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Treeview control does not receive Key events for certain keystrokes. In
particular, it does not generate events for the Enter key or the arrow
navigation keys.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. Add a
   TreeView control to Form1. If the TreeView control is not visible in the
   ToolBox, from the Tools menu, select Custom Controls and select the Microsoft
   Windows Common Controls. Since TreeView is the only control on Form1, it
   receives the focus automatically.

2. Place the following code in Form1:

         Private Sub TreeView1_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)

         Debug.Print "keyDown"

         End Sub

         Private Sub TreeView1_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer)

         Debug.Print "keyPress"

         End Sub

         Private Sub TreeView1_KeyUp(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)

         Debug.Print "keyUp"

         End Sub

3. Run the project by pressing the F5 key. Press the Enter key or an arrow key
   and notice that no key events are generated. The Escape key, the backspace
   key, and other keys generate events correctly.
