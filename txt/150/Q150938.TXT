PROD/VER::; winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print with a device resident font, for example Albertus Medium, the
font may not appear. This happens when you use a device font in a document from
Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint or any third-party applications with a
black or colored background.

CAUSE
=====

Using the Print Text as Graphic option will correct rasterized and True Type
fonts, but not device fonts. Windows NT will remove the device font from an
applications font list when Print Text as Graphic is selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select another font or contact the manufacturer of the printer to obtain the
same font in a True Type version.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
