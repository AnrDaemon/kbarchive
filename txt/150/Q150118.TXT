TITLE   :XADM: Err Msg:  The Ordinal 25 Could Not be Located
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbusage exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you try to start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program from the
Microsoft Exchange program group, the following error might be generated:

   The Ordinal 25 could not be located in the Dynamic Link Library LIBXDS.DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error can occur when you upgrade from an older Microsoft Exchange Server
and you tell the Microsoft Exchange Setup program not to remove or replace
existing files. This can leave more than one Libxds.dll on the computer and when
the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program starts, it could load the wrong
one.


RESOLUTION
==========

Start the Windows NT File Manager, select Search from the File menu, enter the
root of the system drive where the operating system files are located in the
Start From box, verify the Search All Subdirectories checkbox is checked, enter
Libxds.dll in the Search For box, and click OK. If more than one instance of
this file is found, remove any that are not in the system32 subdirectory.

If this does not resolve the problem, remove all instances of Libxds.dll and copy
this file from the Microsoft Exchange Server CD under
setup\<platform>\Libxds.dll into the system32 subdirectory.
