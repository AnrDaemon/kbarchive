The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

There are several registry settings you can set in Visual Basic's Visual
SourceSafe interface by using the Options menu item. There are also several of
the Srcsafe.ini file settings that you can set from Visual Basic's Visual
SourceSafe interface by using the tabbed dialog boxes in the advanced portion of
the Visual SourceSafe Options.

This article lists the options that are available in Visual Basic's Visual
SourceSafe Options and the settings they modify in both the registry and the
Srcsafe.ini file.

Developers who also use SourceSafe integration with DevStudio should take care,
since the .ini file settings will also affect the integration with DevStudio.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the registry, under the following registry path, there are a series of
options that can be set from the Visual Basic or Visual SourceSafe Options
window:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SourceCodeControlProvider\Options

To set the Registry options, on the Add-Ins, SourceSafe menu, click Options.
