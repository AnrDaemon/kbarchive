TITLE   :Win2w95.exe Run from \MSTEST Directory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the upgrade from Windows for Workgroups to Windows 95 in Package
Command Manager, you may, if the client is unable to access the specified logon
server, receive the following error:

   Could not load file from logon server
   \\LOGONSERVER\SMS_SHR\X86.BIN\409\_OSW16RC.DLL

CAUSE
=====

When executed from the Logon.srv\MSTEST directory, Win2w95.exe loads the
Resource.dll from the same logon server from which it was run. If Win2w95.exe
was run from the package directory on the distribution server, it searches
Sms.ini for a logon server from which it can load the Resource.dll. If it
chooses a logon server that is inaccessible to the client (for example, because
the server is down or the server is across a router and the client is using a
protocol like NetBEUI that does not cross the router), the client may receive
the error quoted above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a new package without including Win2w95.exe in the package.
Logon.srv\MSTEST already contains Win2w95.exe. Win2w95.eXE will run from the
default logon server for the client. This eliminates the possibility of not
being able to access the .dll for the client.
