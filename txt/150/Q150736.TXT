======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When SNA Server is configured with one or more 802.2 Token Ring or Ethernet
connections on Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 (or 3.51 Service Pack 1-4), you may
have one of the following problems:

 - When you stop SNA Server, the SNA Server Admin program shows the server in a
   perpetual Stopping state. A net start command shows the SNA Server service as
   stopped, though one or more 802.2 link services (SNADLC1, SNADLC2, ...) will
   still be started.

 - If an 802.2 connection is stopped or fails, the connection may be stuck in an
   Inactive state and it is not possible to restart it using SNA Server Admin.

CAUSE
=====

During connection shutdown, the SNA Server 802.2 link service issues commands
(such as DIR_READ_LOG or DLC_CLOSE_STATION) to the Windows NT Dlc.sys driver
that never completes, causing the link service to fail to respond to the SNA
Server's Close(Link) request.

When it processes these commands, the Windows NT DLC driver is waiting on a
response from the underlying NDIS miniport driver. However, the Windows NT
Ndis.sys wrapper request handler was not properly processing requests from the
transport driver in some cases, causing an NDIS command to fail to complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Microsoft for a Windows NT 3.51 hotfix for this problem.
