TITLE   :Event 3 May Indicate Excessive APPC LU Partnerships

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you define too many LU-LU partnerships, SNA Server will run out of Internal
Mode Control Blocks. You may get the following Dr. Watson error message in SNA
Server:

   80000003 (hardcoded breakpoint).

In addition, the following Event 3 will be logged in the Application Event log:

   

   Event ID: 3 (1102) Node Configuration Error
   EXPLANATION:
   The SNA server (node) detected a configuration file problem caused by a
   logic error in the configuration program. These subcodes should not
   occur during normal operation.


CAUSE
=====

Each LU-LU partnership requires one Internal Mode Control Block (IMCB), and an
additional IMCB is reserved if the LU is defined for parallel sessions. The
limit is 4096 Internal Mode Control Blocks per SNA Server.

For example, a configuration with 240 connections (each with 1 LU defined) and a
node with 10 local LUs (each partnered with every remote LU) will result in the
use of 2400 Mode control blocks. In addition, if the LUs support parallel
sessions, each is implicitly partnered with the SNASVCMG mode for CNOS, taking
up another 2400 control blocks, for a total of 4800 control blocks. Therefore,
the node reports the error and terminates.

WORKAROUND
==========

Reduce the number of LOCAL LUs configured. Each local LU that is removed saves
2*partner LU Mode control blocks.
