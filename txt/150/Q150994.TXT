======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a graphic image from Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia to an
inkjet printer, you may receive an Invalid Page Fault message.

This error message can occur on Pentium-processor-equipped computers running
Microsoft Windows 95/98.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs if the printer driver software is not fully compatible
with the Pentium computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install an alternative, or "emulation" printer driver.
Use the following guidelines for information on printer driver selection:

 - Consult your printer manual for recommended emulation drivers. Or,use the
   next closest model available in Windows.

 - Use a Windows 95/98 32-bit printer driver. For example, do not click the
   "Have Disk" button when you are using the Windows Add Printer Wizard.

   The printers listed at the very end of the Printers list for any manufacturer
   are not usually 32-bit drivers. These 16-bit printer drivers are not listed
   in alphabetical order.

 - Do not use the same printer driver you are currently using.

For more information about how to change printer drivers in Windows, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may be related to the way the printer software accesses the Math
Co-Processor. To test this issue, disable the Numeric Data Processor:

1. With your right mouse button, click My Computer, and then click Properties.

2. On the Device Manager tab, click the plus sign next to System Devices.

3. Double-click Numeric Data Processor.

4. On the Settings tab, click Never Use The Numeric Data Processor.
