======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A client computer uses only LMHOSTS with no WINS servers, and the LMHOSTS file
on this computer contains the following information:

 - IP address and NetBIOS name of the Domain Master Browser. (Generally the
   primary domain controller [PDC])

 - The domain name is preceded by the #PRE #DOM: tag, for example:

   200.1.1.1 PDC machine #PRE #DOM:Domain_name

When you try to Net view the Domain that is located across the router, the
following error message appears:

   There are no entries in the list.

RESOLUTION
==========

In addition to the above line, you also need to add the following line in the
LMHOSTS:

   

   <IP address><tab>"DOMAIN NAME   \0x1B" <tab> #PRE

IP address is the IP address of the PDC of the remote domain.

NOTE: The Domain name is limited to 15 characters. If the Domain name is less
than 15 characters, use spaces to fill it up to 15 characters. The hexadecimal
value 1B is appended following the Domain name and starts with the 16th
character (20 characters overall). The Domain name must be all upper-case
letters and must be inside quotation marks. You can verify that the entry has
loaded into cache correctly by running the nbtstat -c command. You should see
the domain name <1B> entry in cache.
