SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to an SMS database using the SMS Administrator, the
following error message appears:

   This version of SMS Administrator (Build xxx) is not compatible with the
   specified database (Build 600).

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you use SQL Server to create an SMS database that
contains no objects.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, choose to allow the SMS Setup program to build the SMS
database on one of the following types of devices:

1. A device that is pre-existing.

2. A device created by the SMS Setup program (if SQL is installed on the site
   server).

3. A device manually created by you.

The SMS Setup program will automatically create the site database on that device
so that it occupies the entire device.
