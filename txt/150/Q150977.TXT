======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following error may be generated by the MSExchangeIS service and logged in
the Application Log in Microsoft Windows NT Event Viewer:

   Event ID 1085

   Some data referred to code page <number> that is currently not supported
   by the operating system.

If any localized Microsoft Exchange Clients have mailboxes on a Microsoft
Exchange Server computer, the Exchange Server computer must have the correct
code pages installed for the appropriate character mapping to occur. You must
install the code page on the Exchange Server computer in Control Panel by
double-clicking International, and the Locales property sheet for that Exchange
Server computer must list the code page (in other words, the language) under
Selected Locales.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the Exchange Server computer to allow localized Exchange Clients to
connect and see information that is properly sorted and formatted for their
language, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program, select the Servers object,
   and select the Exchange Server computer that is generating the error.

2. On the File menu, click Properties, and click the Locales tab. Add the
   appropriate languages from the list on the left. If the appropriate code page
   has not been installed in Microsoft Windows NT, a prompt appears that asks
   you to install the code page.

3. In accordance with the procedure outlined in the Readme file provided on the
   Microsoft Exchange Server CD:

   a. Log on to the Microsoft Windows NT Server computer as a local
      administrator.

   b. In Program Manager, select the Main program group, and in Control Panel,
      double-click International.

   c. In Language, select the language support you want to add to the computer,
      and click OK. You are prompted to specify the location of the national
      language support files.

   d. Restart the computer.

   e. Reset the country and language settings back to their original settings.

This procedure may change with the release of Windows NT Server version 4.0.

Following is a list of languages and the corresponding Windows NT code pages that
the data is translated into. The <number> in the error message corresponds
