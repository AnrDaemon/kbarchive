TITLE   :Event ID 529 Unknown User Name Or Bad Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you add newly created user accounts to a domain, you may notice that
Windows 95 clients cannot log on to the domain with any of the newly created
accounts. The Windows 95 clients will report the following error:

   User name cannot be found

The same Windows 95 clients can log on to the domain with previously existing
user accounts. You will also notice that Windows NT workstations can log on to
the domain with these newly created accounts.

Check the primary domain controllers (PDCs) Event Viewer Security Log for the
following:

Event ID 529
Description:
Logon Failure:

   Reason:     Unknown user name or bad password
   User Name:  GUEST
   Domain:     NameOfYourDomain
   Logon Type: 3
   Logon Process: NCPSrv
   Authentication Package:
   Workstation Name:

NOTE: Your entries may vary, that is, the user name will not always be GUEST.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above scenario has been linked to other domain controllers in the domain
running out of resources. At this point, you will need to check all of the
servers in the domain that validate user accounts.

Check all the servers in the domain that validate user accounts for:

 - servers that are running out of disk space.

 - servers that have stopped responding (this may mean actually visiting the
   server).

 - servers that report Event IDs stating they have not been able to synchronize
   with the PDC. The server will report that insufficient system resources exist
   to complete the requested service.

After you find the domain controller with insufficient system resources, you may
either take that server offline, so that it is not involved in the validation
process, or fix the resource problem and re-synchronize the domain controller
with its PDC. If the problem persists, you may need to take a trace of the
Windows 95 computer while it is trying to log on to the domain to help further
identify problem areas.
