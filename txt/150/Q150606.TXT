======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install an Apple Laserwriter on your network and set it up for
spooling through Windows NT, the following message appears in Event Viewer:

   Event id: 4024 Source: MacPrint Type: Error
   The printer <printer name> could not be registered on the AppleTalk
   Network

CAUSE
=====

The share name created for this printer on the Windows NT Server is the same as
the printer name.

Apple Laserwriter printers connected to the network with a network interface card
(NIC) or other adapter will broadcast themselves on the network. If the printer
is created on a Windows NT Server for use by other clients on the network, and
the share name is the same as the printer name, the printer will not be able to
register itself on the network.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the share name of the printer to something other than the printer name.
