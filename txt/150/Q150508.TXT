TITLE   :Netscape Clients Hang While Posting Data to SSL Forms on IIS
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using a Netscape Browser to connect to a Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
protected form on the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), the browser
appears to hang when submitting the form data to the server by the POST method.

CAUSE
=====

A timing window exists in IIS where the service may lose received data. IIS
waits for data from the client (which was already sent), and the Netscape
Browser waits since it has sent the data.

RESOLUTION
==========

This timing window has been eliminated.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
