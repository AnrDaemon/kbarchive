TITLE   :Clients Cannot Connect to Server with SysKonnect FDDI Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Network clients using the NetBEUI protocol cannot connect to a server with a
SysKonnect FDDI network adapter. The client computer may display the following
error message:

   Error 53: The network path was not found

while the Server receives the following event when the SysKonnect driver is
logged:

   Event 5007 Timed out during an operation

If the event is logged while the server is running, other protocols (such as
TCP/IP and NWLink) resume operation. If you perform a network trace, you notice
that the server no longer responds to NetBIOS name resolution broadcasts.

CAUSE
=====

When the SysKonnect driver cannot access the FDDI ring for 15 seconds, the Event
5007 is logged and the card is reset. This is normally a hardware problem with
interrupt or DMA settings or an unplugged cable. When the ring is operational
again, a client using the NetBEUI protocol cannot reconnect as the driver does
not re-register the NetBIOS multicast address.

RESOLUTION
==========

Please contact SysKonnect for an updated driver that may correct this problem.
