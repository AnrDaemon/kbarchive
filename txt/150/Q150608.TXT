TITLE   :Multilanguage Font Entries Are Not Removed from WordPad
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install and then later remove the Multilanguage Support option, the
multilanguage fonts continue to appear in the Fonts box in WordPad.

If you select a multilanguage font [such as Times New Roman (Greek)], the Western
version of the font [such as Times New Roman (Western)] is used. The Western
version of the font is displayed and printed correctly.

This problem also affects Microsoft Paint, but does not affect other programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Select fonts using the Fonts command on the Format menu. The correct fonts
   are listed.

 - Reinstall Windows 95. Do not select the Multilanguage Support option. When
   Setup is finished, the multilanguage fonts entries are removed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
