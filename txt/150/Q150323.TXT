TITLE   :Computer Appears to Stop Responding Restarting in MS-DOS Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a computer with an XGA display adapter, when you attempt to restart
your computer in MS-DOS mode, your computer may appear to stop responding (hang)
at a black screen.

CAUSE
=====

The XGA driver does not properly switch the XGA adapter out of XGA mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

At the black screen where the computer appears to hang, type the command "mode
co80" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER. This resets the display
mode, so that the command prompt is visible. Note that you are not able to see
the "mode co80" command as you type it.

To prevent having to type "mode co80" each time you restart in MS-DOS mode, use
the appropriate method:

Method 1
--------

1. Using the Find command, locate the "Exit to Dos.pif" file.

2. Right-click the "Exit to Dos.pif" file, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Program tab, and then edit the Cmd line so that it reads:

   C:\Windows\Command.com /k mode co80

4. Click OK.

Method 2
--------

1. Using the Find command, locate the "Exit to Dos.pif" file.

2. Right-click the "Exit to Dos.pif" file, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Program tab, click Advanced, click "Specify a new MS-DOS
   configuration", and then edit the Autoexec.bat file to add this command as
   the first line:

   C:\Windows\Command\mode co80

4. Click OK, and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
