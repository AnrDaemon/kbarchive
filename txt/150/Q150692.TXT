-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy text from Bookshelf and then paste it into Scrapbook, the text
does not appear. Instead, a sound icon is displayed on the Scrapbook page.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a limitation on the items that can be displayed in Scrapbook.
The text actually is pasted into Scrapbook, but the icon displayed is incorrect.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, do one of the following:

Copy the item from Scrapbook into another application, such as Microsoft Word.
The text will display correctly.

-or-

After you copy text from Bookshelf, paste the information directly into the other
application instead of using Scrapbook.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you copy text from Bookshelf and then past it into Scrapbook, three formats
are attached to the copied text: text, RTF, and sound. Scrapbook, by default,
displays the item as sound and therefore displays the sound icon.
