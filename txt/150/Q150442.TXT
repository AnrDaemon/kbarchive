TITLE   :XCLN: Cancel After Adding Service, Installs But Not Configured
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a service to a profile, such as a Personal Folder, you might want
to select the Cancel button during the configuration of the service and expect
the installation of the service to aborted. However, the result is the service
is installed but not configured.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95 clients. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you press the Cancel button during the configuration of several of the
services for the Microsoft Exchange clients, such as Internet Mail (Windows 95),
Microsoft Mail, and Personal Address Book, you will receive the following
information dialog box:

   The service you have just added will not start until you choose Exit
   and Log Off on the File menu, and then restart Microsoft Exchange.

After you select the OK button, the service is installed even though the Cancel
button was pressed.

If you select the Cancel button during the configuration of Personal Folders, the
following dialog box is displayed:

   Properties for this information service must be defined prior to use.

The result is the same; an unconfigured Personal Folder service is installed.
