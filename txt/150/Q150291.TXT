TITLE   :BUG: Empty File Name in PrivateProfile APIs Returns True
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbVCkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, version 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Mac OS (all) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

WritePrivateProfileString() and GetPrivateProfileString() return TRUE when using
an empty string as the file name parameter. They should fail and return FALSE
when there is no cached file name value.

CAUSE
=====

When you pass an empty string ("") as the file name parameter to either
WritePrivateProfileString() or GetPrivateProfileString(), the Windows
Portability Library (WPL) incorrectly matches the empty string with the empty
invalid cached file name. The invalid cache entry contains an invalid refNum
(-1).

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not pass an empty string as the file name parameter. Use the fully qualified
name instead.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
