TITLE   :BUG: OLE Container Launches Word When Resized
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbVBp400

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Resizing the Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 OLE Container control at run-time, when
it contains a Microsoft Word document, causes Word to be launched. This behavior
is different if a Microsoft Excel Worksheet or other OLE Server document is
embedded in the OLE Container control. This is also different than the behavior
in Microsoft Visual Basic 3.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this issue and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Place an OLE Container Control on a form. Insert a Word document into the
   control by selecting any Word file in the Insert Object dialog box.

2. Place a Command button on the form and place the following code in the Click
   event for the button:

         'Resize the control

         OLE1.Width = 2 * OLE1.Width

         'Test if the application is running

         Msgbox OLE1.AppIsRunning

3. Run the program by pressing the F5 key and then press the Command button.
   Notice that Word is launched by the True result of the MsgBox.
