TITLE   :PRB: Setup Wizard Fails on HELO_SRV.VBP OC30.DLL Reference
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole kbVBp400 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport kb32bitOnly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Setup Wizard fails when trying to locate the OC30.DLL file if it is used to
build distribution disks for the \Vb\samples\remauto\hello\Helo_srv.VBP sample
project.

CAUSE
=====

The Helo_svr.VBP project was originally built using a BETA version of Visual
Basic 4.0. The references are not properly updated in the released version of
Visual Basic 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to resolve this problem:

1. Open the project in the design environment.

2. On the References Menu, select Options. Open the References dialog box.

3. Remove the Standard OLE Types reference for OC30.DLL and add the Standard OLE
   Types reference for OLEPRO32.DLL.

4. Save the project.

5. Run the Setup Wizard on the project.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Helo_srv.VBP sample project incorrectly makes a reference to the OC30.DLL
file for the Standard OLE Types. This file is a run-time file for OCX controls
built with the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) 3.0. This file is not included
with Visual Basic, and Visual Basic does not use it. The 32-bit edition of
Visual Basic 4.0 points to the OLEPRO32.DLL file for the Standard OLE Types.

There is an unrelated problem dealing with the OC30.DLL file. Many third party
OCX manufacturers fail to ship this file with their OCXs built with MFC 3.0.
Because Visual Basic does not include this file, the OCXs fail to register and
run. This file must be obtained from the OCX manufacturer or Microsoft Visual
C/C++ support.
