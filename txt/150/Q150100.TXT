The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2

SUMMARY
=======

Technote 64 states the following:

   Controls that support apartment-model threading should indicate this
   capability in the registry, by adding the key ThreadingModel with a
   value of Apartment under their class ID registry entry. To cause this
   key to be automatically registered for your control, pass the
   afxRegApartmentThreading flag in the sixth parameter to
   AfxOleRegisterControlClass.


This information is not correct. Apartment-model threading is not supported by
MFC in Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 4.1. The
afxRegApartmentThreading value is not used in this version and the registry is
not modified to reflect apartment-model threading support.

This documentation error was fixed in Visual C++ version 5.0. The following text
was added to Technote 64 in Visual C++ 5.0:

   Note that apartment-model threading is only supported in Visual C++
   versions 4.2 or later.
