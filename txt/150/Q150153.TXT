TITLE   :RAS Error: "Event 20077...The Account Is Disabled"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51 95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the account lockout feature in User Manager on your Windows NT RAS
server, you may eventually see the following error in the System Log of the
Event Viewer:

   Event ID: 20077 Source: Remote Access Service

   An error occurred in the Point to Point Protocol module on port COM<x. The
   account is disabled.

CAUSE
=====

This error results from an RAS client's exceeding the number of bad logon
attempts permitted by the setting in the Account Policy option of the User
Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

By itself, the error message text for event 20077 does not provide the
information needed to identify the RAS client responsible for the error. To
track the source of the invalid logon attempts, you can enable the Auditing for
Logon Failure option. To do this, go into User Manager, open the Policies menu,
and use the Auditing option to enable Auditing for Logon Failure." You should
then be able to correlate the failed logon error message with the RAS client
that triggered the error.

Each Security Log logon failure entry will record the user name and time of the
failed logon attempt. This record will show the reason as "Unknown user name or
bad password." When the user exceeds the bad logon attempt limit, the Security
Log will record a logon failure and give the reason "Account locked out." This
last failure should correspond exactly in time to the event 20077 in the System
Log.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the limit of bad logon attempts is exceeded, on a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51
RAS client, the following error will display on the screen:

   Error 67: The account is disabled.

When the bad logon limit is reached but not exceeded by a Windows 95 dial-up
networking (DUN) client to an NT RAS server, the client may display the
following error:

   The computer you have dialed into has denied access because your user name
   and/or your password is invalid on the domain.

When a Windows 95 DUN client exceeds the logon limit, the following error is
displayed:

   Your account is not active. Contact your network administrator.
