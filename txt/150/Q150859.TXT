SYMPTOMS
========

In the SMS 1.1 Japanese environment, it is not possible to map Windows NT
clients to <new domain> from <current domain> using the Smsls.ini
file.

Running Smsls.bat in verbose mode will show:

        Find the Server from the INI file
      get def INI Name using path from arg[0]
      inifile(\\<servername>\NETLOGONsmsls.ini)
      SMS.INI sez () () () () ()
      current sez (\\<servername>\NETLOGONsmsls.ini)
      Check (\\<servername>\NETLOGONsmsls.ini) for domain
      Error:-1 Opening (\\<servername>\NETLOGONsmsls.ini)

NOTE: This problem occurs only with the Japanese version of SMS1.1(x86, Alpha,
Mips).

CAUSE
=====

A backslash (\) is missing between NETLOGON and smsls.ini.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Japanese version of Systems
Management Server version 1.1. A fix to this problem is in development, but has
not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this
