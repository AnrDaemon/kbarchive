TITLE   :Preventing Repeated APPC Session Activation Failures Event 18

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When SNA Server is configured with independent APPC LU6.2 sessions, SNA Server
will automatically initiate LU6.2 session negotiation with the remote system for
each configured LU/LU/mode pair when the connection is started. The independent
LU6.2 LUs require an initial SNA Service Manager (SNASVCMG) mode BIND between
the LUs in order for session limit (CNOS) negotiation to take place.

If a BIND error is received on this mode, SNA Server will log the following Event
18:

NOTE: It will continue to retry.

   Event 18

   APPC session activation failure: BIND negative response or UNBIND
   request received

   Sense data = <sense data>
   Connection = <connection name>
   LU alias = <local LU alias>
   PLU alias = <remote LU alias>
   Mode name = SNASVCMG

If the remote system is not currently active (for example, if the remote system
is CICS though the CICS region has been brought down for maintenance), the Event
18 will be logged for each BIND failure.

The SNA Server NOINITCNOS registry setting can be set to prevent these repeated
Event 18 errors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server supports a registry entry that disables automatic LU6.2 session
negotiation using the NOINITCNOS registry setting, as documented in the SNA
Server [ASCII 147]Reference Guide,[ASCII 148] page 195 (in Appendix C). This
will cause SNA Server to perform LU6.2 session negotiation only when an
application requests a conversation over an LU/LU pair.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/Snaservr
   /Parameters/ 

   NOINITCNOS: REG_SZ: YES

If this entry is not present in the registry, it defaults to No.
