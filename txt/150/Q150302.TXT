TITLE   :Overlapped I/O to Tape Results In Data Corruption
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Data corruption occurs when you write data to the Windows NT 3.51 tape drivers
using overlapped I/O. The Windows NT backup program NTBackup.exe does not
support overlapped I/O, so this problem only affects developers writing
third-party backup software for Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

The data corruption occurs because the tape drivers do not zero out the
QueueSortKey in the SCSI Request Block (SRB) before submitting the SRB to the
SCSIPort driver. As a result, random values are placed in the QueueSortKey,
causing overlapped writes to be committed to tape out of order.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the tape drivers to set the QueueSortKey to zero before submitting write
requests to the SCSIPort driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in <product and version>.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
