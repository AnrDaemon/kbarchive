TITLE   :Bookshelf 96-97 Installed Before Word Will Not Integrate
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.x,6.x
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer using Windows 3.x, if Bookshelf 96-97 is installed before
Microsoft Word 6.0, the Word Integration feature is not available.

NOTE: The only Word Integration feature is a Word shortcut menu for "Define."
This is accessed in Word by clicking on a word with your right mouse button.

Reinstalling Bookshelf does not add the integration.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design in the 16-bit version of Bookshelf. The Word
Integration"option is added in a Typical installation, whether you have Word or
not.

Reinstalling Bookshelf will not add the integration since the option has already
been added.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Run Bookshelf Setup and use the Add/Remove option to remove "Word
   Integration."

2. Run Bookshelf Setup again and use the Add/Remove option to add "Word
   Integration." This time Setup will find Word 6.0 and correctly add the
   integration feature.

For information about how to run Setup, please see the CD-ROM jewel-case insert
(liner notes).
