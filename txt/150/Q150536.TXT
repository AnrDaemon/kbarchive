-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Windows NT Resource Kit utility Remote Command Service (RCMD),
you may receive the following error message:

   Failed to connect to <\\servername>, Error = 53

where servername is the NetBIOS name of the server on which you are attempting to
execute a command.

CAUSE
=====

This error may occur when RCMD cannot communicate with the destination server.

RESOLUTION
==========

The above error equates to the common networking error 53, "The network path was
not found." To resolve this issue, you will need to verify connectivity to the
server. Depending on what networking protocols are in use on your network, this
may involve hardware issues as well as high-level issues, such as name
resolution.
