TITLE   :Windows 95 Logon Script Is Not Processed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows 95 workstation logging on to a Microsoft Windows NT domain controller
may not process the centralized logon script batch file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if multiple Windows 95 workstations try to run a logon
script file (for example, the Winlogon.bat file) located on a single Windows NT
domain controller at the same time. The first time a Windows 95 workstation
access the logon script file, it does so in Read/Share/Exclusive mode. All
subsequent accesses to the file are done in Read/Share/Deny None mode.

The exclusive requests fail when another workstation has the file open in
Read/Share/Deny None mode.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
