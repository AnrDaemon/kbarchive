TITLE   :Microsoft Voice Does Not Extract WordPad Commands
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 msphone1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you start WordPad using the mouse or keyboard, and then open a second
instance of WordPad using the "Start Running WordPad" voice command,
WordPad-specific voice commands may not be executed. In addition, issuing the
"What can I say" voice command may not display the list of WordPad- specific
voice commands.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Voice normally extracts commands from the menus of an application when
you start or switch focus to that application. However, in the situation noted
in the "Symptoms" section, the menu extraction of WordPad commands does not take
place when WordPad starts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To force Microsoft Voice to extract the list of commands available for WordPad,
switch focus away from the voice-initiated instance of WordPad, and then switch
focus back to that instance of WordPad. At this point, you will be able to
execute WordPad-specific voice commands and view WordPad- specific voice
commands by issuing the "What Can I Say" command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Voice version 1.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NOTE: This problem occurs only with WordPad, and does not occur with other
Windows 95 programs such as Notepad or Paint.
