TITLE   :DOCFIX: SelectObject Declaration is Incorrect in API Viewer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following describes a documentation error for the SelectObject function call
as listed in the 32-bit edition of Visual Basic version 4.0 WIN32API.TXT file
used by the Application Programming Interface (API) Viewer:

      Declare Function SelectObject Lib "user32" Alias "SelectObject" _
      (ByVal hdc As Long, ByVal hObject As Long) As Long

Attempting to use this function as documented results in the following (error
453) error message:

   Specified DLL Function Not Found

STATUS
======

This documentation error was fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SelectObject function is incorrectly documented as existing in the
USER32.DLL file. This function is a Graphics Device Interface function and is
therefore in the GDI32.DLL file. The correct declaration is as follows:

      Declare Function SelectObject Lib "GDI32" Alias "SelectObject" _
      (ByVal hdc As Long, ByVal hObject As Long) As Long

You can also change the statement in the file win32api.txt so the next time you
use the API Text Viewer, the Declare statement will be correct.
