TITLE   :cc:Mail Clients Lock Up Through FPNW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When several OS/2 computers are simultaneously running the router software for
cc:Mail in conjunction with one File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW)
server, the server can cause mail to slow almost to a standstill. You may notice
file locks being kept open for long periods (more than 15 seconds).

CAUSE
=====

There is a hard-coded time-out in the FPNW software that causes the delay on the
file lock.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

The time-out has been changed so that the file lock will be released in a manner
allowing mail to flow normally.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack
for Windows NT Workstation or Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining
