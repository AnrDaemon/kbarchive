SUMMARY
=======

After deleting or renaming a voice command or category, you may find that it is
restored to its original name after you restart Microsoft Phone.

Microsoft Phone is designed to prevent the deleting and modifying of command
categories and certain voice commands.

Only voice commands in the SpeedDialTabs category may be deleted and renamed.

Voice commands in the following categories may be renamed, but not deleted.

 - After entering a phone number

 - After recording a greeting

 - After reviewing e-mail

 - After reviewing voice messages

 - Changing a greeting

 - Get Phone Number

 - Main Menu

 - Recording a greeting

Voice commands listed in the Messages category as well as the categories
themselves cannot be renamed or deleted.

If one of the above situations occurs, Microsoft Phone will reload the entire
category affected with the default names.
