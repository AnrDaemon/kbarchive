======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When calling LoadLibrary followed by FreeLibrary on an MFC regular DLL, and
watching the memory allocations associated with the calling program, you see
that four memory objects are not freed when the DLL is unloaded.

CAUSE
=====

The memory allocated for the m_pszExeName, m_pszAppName, m_pszHelpFilePath, and
m_pszProfileName members of the DLL's CWinApp-derived object is not
automatically released when the DLL unloads.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have not added references or changes to these variables in your code, you
can release the allocated memory manually by doing one of the following two
procedures:

 - If no other global or static objects except the global CWinApp-derived object
   rely on the strings, free the memory for them in the destructor of the global
   CWinApp-derived object. For example:

      CDllAppObject::~CDllAppObject()
      {
        if(m_pszExeName)
          m_pszExeName = GlobalFree(m_pszExeName);

        if(m_pszAppName)
          m_pszAppName = GlobalFree(m_pszAppName);

        if(m_pszHelpFilePath)
          m_pszHelpFilePath = GlobalFree(m_pszHelpFilePath);

        if(m_pszProfileName)
          m_pszProfileName = GlobalFree(m_pszProfileName);
      }

   -or-

 - If other global or static objects rely on these strings, then free the memory
   allocated for them in your own implementation of the RawDllMain function. The
   RawDllMain function is called by the C Runtime after all global or static
   objects have had their destructors called. NOTE: Due to the complexity of
   this procedure and the knowledge that MFC's RawDllMain implementation may
   change in future versions of MFC, this approach is not recommended unless
   absolutely necessary. To gain access to and be able to delete the strings in
   your version of RawDLLMai, you must declare four global variables and
   initialize them in the DLL's CWinApp-derived object's InitInstance. For
   example:

         LPCTSTR g_pszExeName = NULL;
         LPCTSTR g_pszAppName = NULL;
         LPCTSTR g_pszHelpFilePath = NULL;
         LPCTSTR g_pszProfileName = NULL;

         BOOL CHeapDllApp::InitInstance()
         {
           if(CWinApp::InitInstance())
           {
             g_pszExeName = m_pszExeName;
             g_pszAppName = m_pszAppName;
             g_pszHelpFilePath = m_pszHelpFilePath;
             g_pszProfileName = m_pszProfileName;

             return TRUE;
           }
           else
             return FALSE;
         }

   Then, in your version of RawDllMain, call GlobalFree on the global pointers
   when the reason for calling is DLL_PROCESS_DETACH. For example:

         extern LPCTSTR g_pszExeName;
         extern LPCTSTR g_pszAppName;
         extern LPCTSTR g_pszHelpFilePath;
         extern LPCTSTR g_pszProfileName;

         extern "C"
         BOOL WINAPI RawDllMain(HINSTANCE, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID)
         {
           if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
           {
             // ... Code abbreviated from DLLMODUL.CPP
           }
           else if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH)
           {
             // restore module state after cleanup
             AFX_MODULE_STATE* pModuleState = AfxGetStaticModuleState();
             _AFX_THREAD_STATE* pState = AfxGetThreadState();
             VERIFY(AfxSetModuleState(pState->m_pPrevModuleState) ==
               pModuleState);
             DEBUG_ONLY(pState->m_pPrevModuleState = NULL);

             #ifndef _AFXDLL
               AfxCriticalTerm();
             #endif

             // NEW CODE ADDED HERE
             // -------------------

             if(g_pszExeName)
               GlobalFree((HGLOBAL)g_pszExeName);

             if(g_pszAppName)
               GlobalFree((HGLOBAL)g_pszAppName);

             if(g_pszHelpFilePath)
               GlobalFree((HGLOBAL)g_pszHelpFilePath);

             if(g_pszProfileName)
               GlobalFree((HGLOBAL)g_pszProfileName);
           }

           return TRUE;
         }

If you have added references or modified the contents of these pointer variables,
you need to free them in a manner appropriate to your usage. If you used the
second procedure and changed the location that one of these variables points to
after saving the address in InitInstance, the code added to RawDllMain frees the
old (wrong) contents of memory and not the new contents that you allocated. When
using the first procedure, make sure you free the old contents pointed to by the
particular variable as well as any strings you have allocated yourself.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The m_pszExeName, m_pszAppName, m_pszHelpFilePath, and m_pszProfileName members
of CWinApp are allocated in the CWinApp::SetCurrentHandles function (APPINIT.CPP
line 107 in version 4.1). SetCurrentHandles is called during the initialization
of a Regular DLL by default.

The MFC source code in SetCurrentHandles says the following regarding the memory
allocations for these CWinApp strings and why the memory is not automatically
released:

NOTE: there are a number of _tcsdup (aka strdup) calls that are made here for the
exe path, help file path, and so on. This memory is not freed and will be
reported by various memory diagnostic utilities. This is not a bug. These
strings cannot be freed because they may be set by the application to anything,
even something that is not on the heap. Furthermore, they may be accessed at any
time, including during destructor calls. Because the order of destructor calls
with respect to the CWinApp object and any other objects in the program is not
deterministic, the CWinApp object cannot free this memory.
