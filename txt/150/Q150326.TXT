SYMPTOMS
========

The opening screen of Wine Guide is distorted. This occurs when you use version

These are the drivers available from the Avance Logic web site at

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Windows 3.x (real mode) drivers. Many Avance Logic Video cards come
with the Hercules Stingray PCI 3.1 drivers on floppy disk. Use this disk to load
the Hercules Stingray PCI 3.1 drivers.
