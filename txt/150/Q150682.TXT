SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse a page created in FrontPage, and attempt to use a custom image
map or a browse-time WebBot component you receive an error message similar to
the following:

   file:<driveletter>/<Web|content|directory>/myWeb/_vti_bin/
   shtml.exe/mypage.htm/ could not be found.

NOTE: Browse-time WebBot components include the following:

   WebBot Confirmation Field component   WebBot Discussion component    WebBot
Registration component   WebBot Save Results component   WebBot Search component

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you browse a FrontPage Web page using a file location
rather than a HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
if the FrontPage Web page contains browse-time FrontPage components. HTTP is
required to access the server extensions to allow these components to run.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use HTTP to look at the page. To do this, start the Web
browser and type the URL of the page. For example, type:

   http://example.microsoft.com/mypage.htm

MORE INFORMATION
================

To open a Web page using the location of the file, start the Web browser and
type the location of the page on your hard disk. For example, type:

   file:<drive letter>:/myweb/<Web content directory>/mypage.htm

When you use this method to view a page, some features of FrontPage Web pages may
not function properly.
