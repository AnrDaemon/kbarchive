Page 6: Windows XP Activation Is 30 Days
----------------------------------------

On page 6, in the final paragraph of the information box titled "Activating
Windows XP",

Change:
"Each copy of Windows XP must be activated within 14 days of the first use."

To:
"Each copy of Windows XP must be activated within 30 days of the first use."


Page 115: My Text File Should Be My Text File.txt
-------------------------------------------------

In Step 11 on page 115, omitting the .txt file extension will prevent the
completion of the exercise.

Change:
"My Text File"

To:
"My Text File.txt"


Quick Reference Card: Keyboard Shortcut For Delete Is Incorrect
---------------------------------------------------------------

On the Quick Reference card in that back of the book, the keyboard shortcut given
to delete a selected item is "A". This should be changed to the DEL key.
