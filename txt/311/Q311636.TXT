======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to locate a Web page, you may receive the following error message:

   HTTP 404 - File not found
   Internet Information Services

CAUSE
=====

A physical directory has been created with non-Latin alphabet characters. A
virtual directory that points to the physical directory that was created in
non-Latin characters has been created with English characters. The IIS metabase
does not recognize non-Latin characters in physical paths.

NOTE: The virtual directory appears with a stop error in the Microsoft Management
Console (MMC).

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not create virtual directories that are mapped to physical directories that
are created with non-Latin alphabet characters.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
