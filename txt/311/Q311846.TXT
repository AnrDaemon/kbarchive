======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM+, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Transaction Server 2.0 
 - Microsoft SQL Server 
 - Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (all editions) 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to help you in the setup or in the
troubleshooting of a configuration for a COM+ Application Server or a
configuration for an Internet Information Server (IIS) computer that interacts
with a clustered server that uses Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) that is behind
a firewall.

You may have one of the following scenarios:

 - COM+ or IIS computer (client computer)

 - SQL Server clustered that uses MSCS

 - Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) as a clustered resource
   in its own resource group (own name and IP address)

 - Cluster and client computer that are separated by a firewall

Certain Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and their corresponding network names
must be known by the client computer for MSDTC to work correctly. The client
computer can resolve the following names and the following IP addresses by using
Domain Name System (DNS), hosts file, or another name resolution method:

 - MSDTC resource

 - An instance of SQL Server if the cluster configuration is either
   active-passive or active-active

 - Cluster Name

Certain IP addresses and their corresponding network names must be known by the
nodes in the cluster for MSDTC to work correctly. Both nodes in the cluster can
resolve the client computer name to an IP address by using DNS, hosts file, or
another name resolution method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Additionally, the firewall must be configured to allow bidirectional traffic to
occur between the client computer and the cluster. The firewall rules must
include the following:

 - The IP network names and the addresses of both physical nodes on the cluster

 - The SQL Server Instances network names and address

 - The client network name and addresses

 - The child network name and IP resource of the MSDTC Resource

Firewall rules must include the range of IP ports that are defined in the
registry to allow traffic. See the "References" section.

You may also have to open an additional range of available IP ports as a
requirement for the cluster server. See the "References" section for more
information.
