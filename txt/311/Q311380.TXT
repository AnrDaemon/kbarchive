PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During high levels of computer stress, a pointer move/assignment may be
overwritten by another thread before that pointer is used by the owning thread.
When the pointer becomes invalid, you may receive the following error message on
a blue screen:

   Stop 00000050 (0xa8070f7c, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000001)

CAUSE
=====

The failure actually occurs in nt!ObSetSecurityDescriptorInfo because of a
pointer move not being under a lock.
