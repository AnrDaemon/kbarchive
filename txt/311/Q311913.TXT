SYMPTOMS

When you try to send notifications which contain the less than (<) character,
the section within the less than (<) and greater than (>) characters is
blank.

CAUSE
=====

When you do not encode the less than (<) and greater than (>) characters,
the less than (<) character throws off the XML, and the error occurs.

Encode the less than (<) and greater than (>) characters before they reach
the nrouter.
