TITLE   :SMS: Clients Do Not Download Large Excluded Programs Lists
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) software metering clients may be unable to
download the excluded programs list from the site if the list becomes very
large. The client tries to download the list for an extended period of time, and
the client's CPU usage may be spiked by the Remodbc.exe process while this is
happening. In the Liccli.log file on the client, the following sequence of
messages is logged:

   Copying reintegration data to server...
   OK
   Offline upload successful
   Downloading client configuration...
   Download failed: Failed to get ignorable exes
   +ON +: Synchronized FAILED.
   Switching OFFLINE ...

Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The excluded programs list corresponds to the contents of the IGNORE table in
the software-metering database. It is recommended that the contents of the
NONLIC table (unlicensed products) be moved periodically to the excluded
programs list; this improves software metering's scalability by preventing
clients from tracking every unlicensed product that is started locally. For
additional information about how to scale software metering, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q263023 SMS: Information on Scaling Software Metering

Because the NONLIC table can grow very large, this means that the excluded
programs list can become very large as well which leads to this problem. The
exact size of the excluded programs list that will cause this problem is not
known, but the problem has occurred with excluded program lists that are 3.5
megabytes or larger.
