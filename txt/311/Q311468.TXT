SUMMARY
=======

In Exchange 2000, Internet Message Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4) protocol does not
support the other user's name space. This functionality is available only in
Exchange Server 5.5. When you open an IMAP4 connection on port 143 (default port
number) to an Exchange server, log on with a user name and password, and then
run the namespace command, Exchange Server 5.5 returns the list of name spaces
including the other users' name spaces (delegated users). Exchange 2000 only
returns the name space for the current user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note the output you receive when you run the following commands:

   telnet <exchange server name> 143
   a001 login <user name><password>
   a002 namespace

In Exchange 2000, you receive the following output:

   * NAMESPACE (("" "/")) NIL (("Public Folders/" "/"))

In Exchange Server 5.5, you receive the following output:

   * NAMESPACE (("" "/")) (("Other users/" "/")) (("Public Folders/" "/"))

Additional query words: IMAP4
