TITLE   :The HP NTLock Services Do Not Start After Installing the SRP
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the post-Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a) Security Rollup
Package (SRP) on a Hewlett-Packard computer with Hewlett-Packard NTLock
installed, you may receive any of the following error messages when you reboot
the computer:

   STOP c000021a

   winlogon.exe - DLL Initialization Failed
   Initialization of the dynamic link library C:\WINNT\System32\HPSmartF.dll
   failed. The process is terminating abnormally.

   HPolLock.exe - DLL Initialization Failed
   Initialization of the dynamic link library C:\WINNT\System32\HPSmartF.dll
   failed. The process is terminating abnormally.

   WIxInitialize
   HP Gina specific initialization failed: Disable ALL HP Lock features.

If you uninstall NTLock properly before you install the SRP, the computer boots
correctly and remains stable. However, the HPGate service does not start
properly and you receive repeated "failed service" notifications every time you
start the computer. If you then install the latest NTLock software, the computer
does not boot properly and you may receive any of the error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The SRP exposes an issue with Hewlett-Packard Entlk 2.2a and earlier versions of
NTLock (Hpgate.sys) that is available from any of the following Hewlett-Packard
sources:

 - The Hewlett-Packard Web site: Hewlett-Packard NTLock Software and Drivers
   (http://www.support.vectra.hp.com/vectrasupport/indexes/Driver622.html)

 - The Hewlett-Packard recovery CD-ROM

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, use these steps:

1. If Hewlett-Packard TopTools is installed, make sure that you have installed
   the latest version. The latest versions of TopTools (TopTools 5.0 and 5.5)
   are available from the following Hewlett-Packard Web site:

   http://www.hp.com/toptools/

2. If TopTools is not installed, install the updated version of NTLock before
   you install the SRP. The updated version of NTLock is available from the
   following Hewlett-Packard Web site:

   http://www.support.vectra.hp.com/vectrasupport/indexes/Driver622.html
