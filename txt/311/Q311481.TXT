TITLE   :BETA-PRB: CGI Code That Calls External Applications May Fail
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
This article discusses a beta test product not yet released by
Microsoft. Please feel free to familiarize yourself with this
product, test it, and report problems to Microsoft.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use anonymous authentication and you call external programs (including
PHP programs) from Common Gateway Interface (CGI) code, the operation may fail.

CAUSE
=====

In Internet Information Services (IIS), the IUSR_<computer_name>
(anonymous) account is explicitly denied access to all executable programs in
the %windir%\System32 folder for security reasons. This denial causes CGI code
that attempts to run these external programs in the anonymous security context
to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the IUSR denial access control list (ACL) on the
necessary command-line tools (such as Cmd.exe) that are located in
\%windir%\System32, and grant the IUSR account Read and Execute access.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install PHP 4.0 on IIS 6.0.

2. Associate the .php extension in IIS 6.0 with the Php.exe CGI application. To
   do this, follow these steps:

   a. Open the IIS MMC.

   b. Open the property sheet for the Web site to which you want to add the PHP.

   c. On the Home Directory tab, click Configuration.

   d. Under Application Mappings, click Add.

   e. For Executable, type the path to Php.exe (for example, C:\Php\Php.exe).

   f. For Extension box, type ".php" (without the quotation marks) and click OK.

   g. Save your changes and exit the MMC.

3. In Notepad, save the following code as Test.php:

NOTE: For this code to work, IUSR must have Read and Execute access to Ping.exe.

   <?php
   $output = `ping localhost`;
   echo $output;
   ?>

4. Save the file in the Web site publishing point.

5. Call the file from a Web browser (for example,
   http://<localhost>/test.php).
