TITLE   :EU and Admin Client Traps If OU Name Longer than 64 Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Host Integration Server 2000 End-User (EU) Client or Admin Client is
configured with a long organizational unit (OU) name, the SNA Resource Location
Wizard will terminate abnormally due to an access violation.

If Dr.Watson is configured as the default debugger, you will get a DRWTSN32.log
similar to the following:

Application exception occurred:
        App: HICliCfg.exe (pid=624)
        When: 10/22/2001 @ 15:46:43.986
        Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Resource Location Wizard uses a static string to store the OU name. The
string is defined to contain a maximum of 64 characters. If the OU name is
longer than this, an access violation results.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.
