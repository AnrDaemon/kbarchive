TITLE   :PRB: All Users Do Not Have Access to Installed Application
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbAppSetup kbvfp kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbvfp700

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use InstallShield Express - Visual FoxPro Limited Edition to create setup
disks, the application is only available to the user who runs the set up and
installs the application. The application is not available to everyone who is
logged on to the computer.

CAUSE
=====

By design, unless the set up includes the Customer Information dialog box, the
user who installs the application cannot select the "Anyone who uses this
computer (all users)" check box. If this check box is not selected, the
application is only available to the user who installs the application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, include the Customer Information dialog box in the
Dialogs section of step 4, "Customize the Setup Appearance."

In addition, the user who installs the application must select the "Anyone who
uses this computer (all users)" check box. This check box appears in the
Customer Information dialog box under "Install this application for".

If you have a third-party application, and it is not practical to obtain a new
set up from the vendor, you can run the set up from the Microsoft Windows
command prompt and append "/V"ALLUSERS=1"" (without the quotation marks) to the
end of the command. For example:

   

   C:\DISK ONE\SETUP.EXE" /V"ALLUSERS=1

REFERENCES
==========

topic in the InstallShield Express - Visual FoxPro Limited Edition Help Library.
