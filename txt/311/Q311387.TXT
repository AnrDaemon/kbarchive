TITLE   :XADM: Search Permission Prevents Viewing Membership of DL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are logged on to a client computer and attempt to view the membership of a
distribution list. When you view the properties of the distribution list, you
cannot view the membership list in the Members dialog box, the owner in the
Owner dialog box, or which distribution lists this list is a member of in the
Distribution List Membership window on the Member Of tab.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Search permission has been set on the
distribution list and the user that is logged on does not have the Search
permission.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, remove the Search permission from the distribution
list. To do so:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, open the properties
   of the distribution list.

2. Click the Permissions tab.

3. View the permissions that are assigned to the accounts listed in the "Windows
   NT accounts with permissions" box.

4. Clear the Search check box for any account that has the Search permission in
   the Rights dialog box.

5. Click OK to close the distribution list properties.

WORKAROUND
==========

This behavior is by design.
