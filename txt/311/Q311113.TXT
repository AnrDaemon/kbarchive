The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Internet Information Services (IIS) Lockdown Wizard, administrators can
choose the option to uninstall unused services. This configuration option cannot
be undone by using the undo operation in the IIS Lockdown Wizard.

CAUSE
=====

When you run the IIS Lockdown Wizard, it creates a log file named Oblt-log.log
that records the security configuration changes that are made. There is an
option available in the wizard that you can select to uninstall the services
that are not in use. The Oblt-log.log file, which is used when you use the
wizard to undo a previous configuration, does not record that the services have
been uninstalled. As a result, the undo feature does not restore any previously
uninstalled services.
