PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Microsoft Windows 2000 Active Directory-based environment with Systems
Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later installed and success
auditing of directory service access enabled, the SMS Service account may
generate many Event ID 565 entries in the Security event log.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the SMS Service account's group membership is
evaluated repeatedly as Collection Evaluator monitors collections.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable the success auditing of directory service
accesses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
