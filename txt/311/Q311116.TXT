SUMMARY
=======

The "URLScan" section of the IIS Lockdown Tool 2.0 documentation contains an
explanation of the AllowDotInPath setting that is incorrect.

The AllowDotInPath documentation contains the following text, which is
incorrect:

   AllowDotInPath: Allowed values are 0 or 1. Default is 0. If set to 1, UrlScan
   rejects any requests containing multiple instances of the dot (.) character.
   If set to 0, UrlScan does not perform this test.

The documentation should read:

   AllowDotInPath: Allowed values are 0 or 1. Default is 0. If set to 0, UrlScan
   rejects any requests containing multiple instances of the dot (.) character.
   If set to 1, UrlScan does not perform this test.
