The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some advertisement status messages from client computers may not be returned to
the SMS database and Status Manager may sporadically delete status message files
and log errors stating that the files are in use and damaged. If you experience
this problem, you can view the log entries that are similar to the following log
entries in the Statmgr.log file:

   ERROR: Could not open file
   "C:\SMS\inboxes\statmgr.box\statmsgs\IBNQWXY4.SVF", the file is assumed to be
   corrupt. The operating system reported error 5: Access is denied. Deleted
   corrupt file "C:\SMS\inboxes\statmgr.box\statmsgs\IBNQWXY4.SVF".

   -or-

   ERROR: Could not open file
   "C:\SMS\inboxes\statmgr.box\statmsgs\IUSH4YZ5.SVF", the file is assumed to be
   corrupt. The operating system reported error 32: The process cannot access
   the file because it is being used by another process. ERROR: Could not delete
   corrupt file "C:\SMS\inboxes\statmgr.box\statmsgs\IUSH4YZ5.SVF". The
   operating system reported error 32: The process cannot access the file
   because it is being used by another process.

Similar problems with other components may also occur. View the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article for information about similar symptoms when you
use the Software Inventory Processor component:

   Q303279 SMS: Software Inventory Processor Has a Critical Status

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Inbox Manager Assistant (SMS_INBOX_MANAGER_ASSISTANT)
copies a file from a Client Access Point (CAP) to the site server because Inbox
Manager Assistant uses the file's original file extension. If the file is large
or if the CAP-to-site server link is slow, the receiving SMS component (for
example, Status Manager) can start processing the file before it is completely
copied.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server (SMS) service
pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language post-Service Pack 3 (SP3) version of this fix should have
the following file attributes or later:

   Date         Time    Version        Size     File name     Platform
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   01-Mar-2001  01:30p  2.0.1493.3206  38,784   Inboxast.dll  Intel
   01-Mar-2001  01:30p  2.0.1493.3206  107,920  Inboxmgr.dll  Intel
   01-Mar-2001  01:30p  2.0.1493.3206  61,200   Inboxast.dll  Alpha
   01-Mar-2001  01:30p  2.0.1493.3206  173,328  Inboxmgr.dll  Alpha

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



After you apply this hotfix, Inbox Manager Assistant copies every file from a CAP
to the appropriate site server Inbox by using a .tmp file extension. After the
file is copied to the Inbox, it is renamed with the correct file extension,
which signals the receiving SMS component to process the file.


How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Install this hotfix on all primary and secondary site servers. To install the
hotfix, use one of the following methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: Use this method only on Intel-based computers.

To use the hotfix installer:

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the update file (Q311212.exe) and platform folders to the new folder.
   The update file must be located one folder above the platform folders.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
   log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
   privileges.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console if it is running.

5. Run Q311212.exe and follow the directions in the wizard.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

To manually install the hotfix:

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the platform folders that contain the hotfix files to the new folder.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
   log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
   privileges.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console if it is running.

5. Stop all SMS services.

6. Replace the Inboxast.dll file in the
   <Sms_root_folder>\Bin\<Platform> folder with the version of the
   file that you obtain from the hotfix.

7. Replace the Inboxmgr.dll file in the
   <Sms_root_folder>\Bin\<Platform> folder with the version of the
   file that you obtain from the hotfix.

8. Perform a site reset for the new Inboxast.dll and Inboxmgr.dll files that
