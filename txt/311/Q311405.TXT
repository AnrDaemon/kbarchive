RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Modifying the registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems that result from incorrectly modifying the registry can be solved.
Modify the registry at your own risk.

Note that you should back up the registry before you modify it. If you are
running Windows NT or Windows 2000, you should also update your Emergency Repair
Disk (ERD).

To resolve this issue, use a .reg file to re-create the appropriate entries:

1. Create a file with the following contents:

   REGEDIT4

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{6D807884-7D21-11CF-801C-08002BE10318}]
   @="Tape drives"
   "Class"="TapeDrive"
   "Icon"="1610"
   "Installer32"="SysSetup.Dll,TapeClassInstaller"
   "LegacyInfOption"="TAPE"

2. Save the file with a .reg file name extension.

3. Double-click the .reg file to merge its contents into the registry on your
   computer.

You do not need to reboot your computer after you merge the .reg file into the
registry.
