TITLE   :IIS Incorrectly Processes Escape Characters in URI
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Internet Information Services (IIS) version 5.0 receives a Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) that includes an embedded special character that is formatted
as an escape character, IIS may not process the URI correctly. For example,
instead of processing the escape character "%2b" as a plus sign (+), IIS may
process the escape character "%2b" as an argument separator.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 2000.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.
