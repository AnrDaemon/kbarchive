SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Printer Control Language (PCL) codes in a Printer Definition Table
(PDT) to change font point sizes, this may have no effect on the height of
characters in the printed output of a PCL emulation printer.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Primary Height control character sequence in a PDT to set the
parameters of your printed output, this procedure will work only with certain
fonts. This is because the height or point size of characters in a PCL
environment are handled in two different manners, depending upon whether the
font is a proportional font (such as Arial) or a fixed pitch font (such as
Courier). These fonts are also referred to as scalable and bitmapped,
respectively.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can set the height of a proportional font by using the Primary Height
control string. You can manipulate the height of a fixed pitch font by changing
the horizontal pitch: the more characters per inch, the shorter the characters.

The following is the command sequence to configure the Primary Height setting:

   1B 28 73 # 56

The # character is a hexadecimal representation of an ASCII value, meaning that
point size 12 is represented by "31 32."

The default for fixed pitch fonts is 8.5 points; the default for proportional
fonts is 12 points.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select fonts and point sizes, be aware that fonts have a distinct set
of parameters that must be set in a sequential or hierarchical manner. A font is
described by the Symbol Set, Spacing, Height, Pitch, Style, Stroke Weight,
Typeface, and Orientation parameters. For example, if you choose a particular
font whose characteristics do not fit in the default symbol set, the default
font or another font will be used.
