SYMPTOMS
========

If a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Software Metering client uploads an
offline log file while the computer clock is temporarily set with a future date
and the computer clock is then restored to current time and date, this prevents
any further log uploads until the temporary date is reached. If the client had
used a time that was a number of years in advance, that is how long the client
goes without uploading an offline log. Further client logs, despite having the
correct current date/time stamps, are held on the client.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the time of the next offline log upload is calculated
at the time of a successful upload, and is a combination of the current date and
time obtained from the computer clock plus the Configuration Polling interval.
This value is stored in the following registry key on the client:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client Components\LICENSE
   METERING\Properties\NextOfflineSyncTime

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, clean the client by using a utility such as
20clicln.bat from the SMS 2.0 Support Tools, and then reinstall the client after
you verify that the NextOfflineSyncTime registry key has been removed.
