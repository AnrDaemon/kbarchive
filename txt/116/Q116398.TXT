The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains steps to remove the PrintCache utility from your Windows
configuration and suggestions for troubleshooting specific problems related to
using PrintCache in Windows. If you need additional assistance with PrintCache,
contact LaserTools Technical Support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LaserTools PrintCache versions 3.0 and 3.1 modify all installed printer drivers
to send their information to PrintCache's GDX.EXE instead of Windows' GDI.EXE.
It is sometimes necessary to disable PrintCache for troubleshooting purposes.

NOTE: To use 32-bit file access (VFAT) in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you must
disable PrintCache. If you install PrintCache and then start Windows for
Workgroups, you receive the following error message:

   32-Bit File Access was unable to run.
   This may be because you started the network before starting Windows, because
   Windows could not find the IFSHLP.SYS driver, or your hard disk(s) may be
   incompatible with 32-bit File Access.

Removing PrintCache
-------------------

To remove PrintCache from Windows:

1. Run INSTALL.EXE from the PCACHE directory and then press ENTER to continue.

2. Select the Windows Pcache option.

3. Choose Remove.

4. If you are using PrintCache version 3.1, also remove the Voice Warning
   option.

5. To complete the removal of PrintCache, exit and then restart Windows.

In some instances, this procedure may not completely remove the modifications
made to the printer drivers. In addition to running the uninstall program, you
may need to change to the PCACHE directory and type the following command:

   nogdx \windows\system\*.drv

This removes modifications made to the printer driver files in the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory.

If this fails to repair the driver files, completely remove the printers from the
Printers dialog box in Control Panel, rename the printer driver(s) in question,
and then reinstall them from your original Windows disks.

Using PrintCache with Windows
-----------------------------

When you use a PrintCache version earlier than 3.0 with Windows, you must either
clear the "Fast Printing Direct To Port" check box in the Connect dialog box, or
print to LPTx.xxx (any extension can be used). To access the Connect dialog box,
choose the Printers icon in Control Panel, and choose Connect.

With PrintCache version 3.0, you do not need to disable "Fast Printing Direct To
Port" because PrintCache 3.0 has a Windows installation utility and dynamic-link
library (DLL) that handle routing data to the printer while taking advantage of
MS-DOS interrupts. In both cases, because PrintCache is handling the MS-DOS
interrupts, no performance degradation results from clearing the Fast Print
Direct To Port option. Also, when you are using PrintCache with Windows version
3.0, you must choose the 386 Enhanced icon in Control Panel and select the Never
Warn option under Device Contention. If Device Contention is not set to Never
Warn, you receive a "Device Conflict" error when you print.

In PrintCache versions earlier than 3.0, if LPTx.xxx is not selected, Windows 3.0
bypasses the PrintCache buffer and prints directly to the parallel port.

PrintCache is manufactured by LaserTools, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
