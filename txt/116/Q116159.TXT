-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you remove the Complete Baseball CD from the CD-ROM drive while you are at
the main menu, you may receive the following error message if you try to choose
one of the selections (such as Almanac or Teams):

   System Error
   Cannot read from drive X.

where X is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.

If you continue to make selections, you may eventually receive an error message
such as the following:

   Cannot open file "X:\baggage\filename.m11." Please make sure the Complete
   Baseball CD is in the drive, and then click OK to try again, or click Cancel
   to close complete Baseball.

If you choose Cancel, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault.

NOTE: This problem also occurs with Microsoft Complete Baseball Guide for
Windows, 1995 edition running in Microsoft Windows 3.1x.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, do not remove the Complete Baseball CD while the program
is running. It is never a good idea to remove any disk or CD while your computer
is reading it.
