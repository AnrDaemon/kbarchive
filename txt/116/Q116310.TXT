TITLE   :FIX: Open Listing File in IDE Is Not Reloaded After Compile
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVCkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the compiler option /Fc, /Fl, or /Fa to create an assembly listing
file (either .COD or .ASM), and that listing file is open when you are building
an application, you will be informed that the listing file has changed and you
will be prompted to reload the file. However, if a file related to the currently
open list file is compiled without using the /Fc, /Fl, or /Fa option, the prompt
to reload the listing file will not be issued unless you set the focus to
another application other than Visual C++ and then return back to Visual C++;
the listing file shown in the Visual Workbench would then not be up to date with
its corresponding source code.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this problem, do the following:

1. Load the file GENERIC.MAK into the Visual Workbench.

2. Choose Project from the Options menu, then choose the Compiler option.

3. From the Compiler Options dialog box, choose the "Listing Files" category.
   Check the "Assembly" check box.

4. Choose OK to save the options, then choose OK again to get back into the
   Visual Workbench editor.

5. Build the project.

6. Open the listing file GENERIC.ASM.

7. Change GENERIC.C by putting an extra space in a comment area.

8. Compile GENERIC.C only. (The Visual Workbench will not notify you that the
   listing file has changed.)
