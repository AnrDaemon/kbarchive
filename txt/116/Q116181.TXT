The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ClassWizard menu option within the Microsoft Visual Workbench is not
disabled when you use a project that is not part of the Microsoft Foundation
Classes (MFC). When you select ClassWizard from the Browse menu while using a
non-MFC project, a dialog box appears that contains the following information:

   "The ClassWizard database C:\xxxxxxxx\yyyyyyyy.CLW does not exist. To rebuild
   your .CLW file, open the project in App Studio and run ClassWizard"

If the project does not use MFC, ClassWizard cannot construct a .CLW file when it
is run from App Studio.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 2.0.

Additional query words: Class Wizard 1.00 1.50, kbNoUpdate
