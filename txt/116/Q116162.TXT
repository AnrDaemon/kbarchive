-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994 edition 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a large fonts video mode with Windows 3.x, the QuickShelf
toolbar will, by default, come up as large buttons centered on the screen.
QuickShelf should come up in small buttons at the upper-left corner of the
screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

To format the QuickShelf toolbar to display in small buttons at the upper-left
corner of the screen, follow these steps:

1. Click the down-arrow button at the end of the QuickShelf toolbar.

2. Choose Customize.

3. Choose the View Tab.

4. Choose Small Buttons radio button, and choose OK.

The QuickShelf toolbar should now switch to small buttons and snap to position in
the upper-left corner of the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem does not occur in Windows 95.

When QuickShelf starts, it checks to see if your video resolution is greater than
or equal to 1024 x 768, and if you are in large font mode, in which case it uses
large buttons.

When QuickShelf is in large button mode, the toolbar is movable, and you can use
the mouse to drag it to any part of the screen. When it is in small button mode,
it snaps to position in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
