Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

In late 1993 and early 1994, Microsoft was approached by several hardware and
software companies to create an industry standard for MPEG on PCs. While
commercial MPEG products for PC are starting to appear, many companies in the
industry believe that a standard playback command set will speed widespread
acceptance of MPEG on the PC.

This MPEG command set is a subset of the "Digital Video Command Set for the Media
Control Interface" (Microsoft part #098-37538).
