The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some hardware may have problems with the Virtual Parallel Device (VPD) used by
Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Symptoms include garbled printing, hanging print
queues, and the inability to use fax drivers or parallel sound devices.

Microsoft has received reports of printing problems on Gateway 2000 computers and
reports of problems on parallel devices with software that requires direct
access to the parallel ports, such as Logitech Soundman and Hewlett-Packard (HP)
LaserJet Fax.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1:

If you do not use your LPT: port for local printing, you can disable
device-contention checking by removing the following line from your Windows
SYSTEM.INI file:

        DEVICE=*VPD

Disabling VPD does not affect the ability of Windows for Workgroups to print over
the network. However, if you are printing locally from an MS-DOS-based
application at the same time as Windows is trying to access the parallel port,
no warning appears and printouts may have garbled characters, or you may
experience network communication problems.

Method 2:

In Control Panel, choose the 386 Enhanced Mode icon. To turn off VPD trapping for
that port, choose the Never Warn option for the port in question.
