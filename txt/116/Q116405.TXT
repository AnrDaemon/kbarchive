PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains a PATH statement with unmatched percent
characters ("%"), for example:

   PATH C:\;%PATH

when you log on, WINLOGON.EXE will terminate with an access violation and this
STOP message will appear:

   STOP: 0xC000021A {Fatal System Error}
   The Windows Logon Process system process terminated unexpectedly with a status
   of 0xC0000005. The system has been shutdown.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT fails to detect a NULL pointer and subsequently, incorrectly de-
references that pointer causing an access violation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To regain access your computer, connect to it remotely over the network and edit
or rename the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Alternately, if the file system is formatted as
FAT, start MS-DOS and edit or rename your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5.
