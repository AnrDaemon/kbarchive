-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows 95, the following error message is displayed:

   Access Pack Error
   Could not initialize the Mini VxD, load aborted
   Press a key to continue

CAUSE
=====

This error message can be caused by older versions of the Sejin SKR-1032
Keyboard/Mouse combination drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

For keyboard support, you can use the Sejin SKR-1032 as a keyboard only if you
use the keyboard drivers that ship with Windows 95. For mouse support, you can
use a separate mouse and the mouse driver that ships with Windows 95.

The steps below reinstall the 101/102 Enhanced keyboard driver and the Microsoft
Mouse driver.

1. In a text editor (such as WordPad or the MS-DOS Editor), open the SYSTEM.INI
   file from your Windows directory.

2. Change the MOUSE.DRV line in the [Boot] section to read:

   MOUSE.DRV=MOUSE.DRV

3. Change the KEYBOARD.DRV line in the [Boot] section to read:

   KEYBOARD.DRV=KEYBOARD.DRV

4. Change the MOUSE= line in the [386Enh] section to read:

   MOUSE=*VMOUSE

5. Change the KEYBOARD= line in the [386Enh] section to read:

   KEYBOARD=*VKD
