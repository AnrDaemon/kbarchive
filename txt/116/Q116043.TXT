TITLE   :Network Share Access Denied After Limit Met, Then a Disconnect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1 3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When two computers access a shared file or application on a network share where
the limit of connections is set to two, a third computer is still unable to
access the shared file or application even after one of the other two computers
have closed the file or quit the application.

CAUSE
=====

By design, a dormant network connection remains alive for 10 minutes after a
computer quits a shared file or application on a network share.

In the case above, the computer that closed the shared file or quit the shared
application still has a dormant network connection and because the network share
is limited to two, the third computer is still unable to access the shared file
or application.

NOTE: Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 behaves the same way.

WORKAROUND
==========

To delete a dormant network connection:

 - From the computer with the dormant connection, use the following command to
   delete the connection:

   NET USE \\server\share /d

   -or-

 - From the server, an administrator can use the following command to delete the
   dormant connection:

   net sess \\computername /d
