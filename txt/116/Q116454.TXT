SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from Windows 95 using the PCL printer driver to a Hewlett-
Packard (HP) DeskJet 1200c or PaintJet 300 XL printer, white text prints on a
colored background; however, colored or black text does not print on a colored
or white background.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only in certain applications. For example, Microsoft Word
6.0 for Windows and Lotus Ami Pro have exhibited this behavior. Road Atlas 4.0
exhibits this same behavior when printing maps.

To work around this problem, use TrueType fonts and set your printer driver to
print TrueType fonts as graphics.

To print TrueType fonts as graphics:

1. Click the Start button on the taskbar.

2. On the Settings menu, click Printers.

3. Use the right (secondary) mouse button to click the HP DeskJet 1200c or
   PaintJet 300 XL printer icon, then click Properties.
