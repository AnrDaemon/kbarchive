TITLE   :ADT2: "Setup Parse Error" Error Message in Run-Time Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Setup from disks that you created with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit, you may receive the following error message after the
"Setup is searching for installed components" screen:

   Setup Parse Error in Initialize Pass. Object ID 1: AppSearch Object: Bad
   Default Path Field.

After this error message, Setup quits without completing.

CAUSE
=====

When you ran the Setup Wizard to create the disks, you specified C:\ as the
default installation directory, or you specified a directory name that is more
than eight characters long. For example, specifying the directory C:\MYPROGRAM
would cause the error message to occur.

Including special characters in the installation directory or application name
can also generate this message. For example, C:\!MYAPP in the default
installation directory or "My Excellent! App" in the Application Name would
cause this error.

Regarding the Application Name, the problem is not with the Application Name
itself but with the fact that it also creates a Program Manager Group Name,
which cannot interpret the special character.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a new set of installation disks. In the Setup Wizard's Default
Installation Directory box, make sure to specify the full path name for the
directory into which your application should be installed (for example,
C:\MYAPP).

STATUS
======

This behavior no longer occurs in the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for
Windows 95 version 7.0.
