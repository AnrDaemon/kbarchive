SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a complete listing of the MS-DOS 6.22 SCANDISK.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

; SCANDISK.INI
;
; This file contains settings you can use to customize the ScanDisk
; program.

; -------------------------------------------------------------------
; The [ENVIRONMENT] section contains the following settings, which
; determine general aspects of ScanDisk's behavior:
;
; Display      Configures ScanDisk to run with a particular type of
;              display. The default display type is Auto (ScanDisk
;              adjusts to the current display).
;
; Mouse        Enables or disables mouse support. The default value is On.
;
; ScanTimeOut  Determines whether ScanDisk should detect disk timeouts
;              while performing a surface scan. The default value is Off.
;
; NumPasses    Determines how many times ScanDisk should check each
;              cluster during a surface scan. The default value is 1.
;
; LabelCheck   Determines whether ScanDisk should check volume labels
;              for invalid characters. The default is Off.
;
; LfnCheck     Enables support for long filenames. The default value is On.
;              If LfnCheck is On, ScanDisk leaves any long filenames
;              unchanged. If LfnCheck is Off, ScanDisk validates
;              all filenames, including long filenames, to ensure that
;              they conform to the "8.3" file-naming convention used by
;              MS-DOS versions 6.22 and earlier.
;

[ENVIRONMENT]
   Display     = Auto   ; Auto, Mono, Color, Off
   Mouse       = On     ; On, Off
   ScanTimeOut = Off    ; On, Off
   NumPasses   = 1      ; 1 through 65,535 (anything over 10 is slow)
   LabelCheck  = Off    ; On, Off
   LfnCheck    = On     ; On, Off

; -------------------------------------------------------------------
; The [CUSTOM] section determines ScanDisk's behavior when ScanDisk is
; started with the /CUSTOM switch. You can adjust these settings to
; create a customized "version" of ScanDisk. This can be especially
; useful for running ScanDisk from a batch file. The [CUSTOM] settings are:
;
; DriveSummary  Determines whether ScanDisk displays full-screen
;               summary information after checking each drive.
;               The default is Auto (ScanDisk displays the summary
;               only if it encounters errors on that drive).
;
; AllSummary    Determines whether ScanDisk displays full-screen
;               summary information after checking all drives.
;               The default is Auto (ScanDisk displays the summary
;               only if it encounters errors on any drive).
;
; Surface       Determines whether ScanDisk will perform a surface scan:
;                  Never    (Default) Does not perform a surface scan.
;                  Always   Performs a surface scan without prompting
;                           first.

;                  Prompt   Prompts before performing a surface scan.
;               The /SURFACE command-line switch overrides this setting.
;
; CheckHost     Determines whether ScanDisk will first check a host drive
;               before checking any compressed drives located on that
;               drive.

;                  Never    (Default) Does not check the host drive.
;                  Always   Checks the host drive without prompting first.
;                  Prompt   Prompts before checking the host drive.
;
; SaveLog       Determines what ScanDisk does with the repair log file:
;                  Off        (Default) Does not save the repair log.
;                  Append     Appends the log to the previous log, if any.
;                  Overwrite  Replaces the previous log with the new log.
;
; Undo          Determines whether ScanDisk creates an Undo floppy disk.
;               The default is Never (ScanDisk does not create an Undo
;               disk).

;               The Prompt value causes ScanDisk to prompt you for a disk.

[CUSTOM]
   DriveSummary  = Auto         ; Auto, On, Off
   AllSummary    = Auto         ; Auto, On, Off
   Surface       = Never        ; Never, Always, Prompt
   CheckHost     = Never        ; Never, Always, Prompt
   SaveLog       = Off          ; Off, Append, Overwrite
   Undo          = Prompt       ; Prompt, Never

; The following settings determine the corrective action ScanDisk will
; take if it was started with the /CUSTOM switch and finds a disk error.

; The next five settings accept any of the following values:
;    Prompt     Causes ScanDisk to prompt you before fixing this problem.
;    Fix        Causes ScanDisk to fix the problem without prompting you.

   Okay_Entries  = Prompt       ; Damaged, but repairable,
                                ; directories/files

   Bad_Chain     = Prompt       ; Files or directories which should be
                                ; truncated
   Crosslinks    = Prompt       ; FAT-level crosslinks

; The next seven settings accept any of the following values:
;    Prompt     Causes ScanDisk to prompt you before fixing this problem.
;    Fix        Causes ScanDisk to fix the problem without prompting you.
;    Quit       Causes ScanDisk to terminate if it encounters this problem.
;    Skip       Causes ScanDisk to skip fixing this problem, but continue
;               checking the disk.

   Boot_Sector   = Prompt       ; Damaged boot sector on compressed drive
   Invalid_MDFAT = Prompt       ; Invalid MDFAT entries
   DS_Crosslinks = Prompt       ; Internal (MDFAT-level) crosslinks
   DS_LostClust  = Prompt       ; Internal lost clusters
   DS_Signatures = Prompt       ; Missing compressed volume file signatures
   Mismatch_FAT  = Prompt       ; Mismatched FATs on non-compressed drives
   Bad_Clusters  = Prompt       ; Physical damage or decompression errors

; The next setting accepts any of the following values:
;
;    Prompt     Causes ScanDisk to prompt you before fixing this problem.
;    Delete     Causes ScanDisk to delete the damaged directory entries
