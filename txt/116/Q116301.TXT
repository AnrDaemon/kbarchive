The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Visual Workbench or Developer Studio Editor, CTRL+] or the Find
Matching Brace command under the Edit menu, finds a matching brace when the
caret is located to the left of an enclosure symbol: either a parenthesis "(",
brace "{", or bracket "[".

The editor is unable to distinguish whether these enclosure symbols are located
within valid code or within a comment. As a result, using CTRL+] may find a
matching enclosure symbol within a comment, as shown in the source code in the
"MORE INFORMATION" section, below.
