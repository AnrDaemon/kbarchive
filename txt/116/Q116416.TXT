KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for the Macintosh 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your system folder is named anything other than "System Folder", you may
receive the following error message when you try to install Bookshelf 1994:

   Installation was cancelled, leaving the disk <diskname> untouched.

As the message indicates, the installation stops and nothing is installed.

This is most likely to occur if you try to perform a complete installation or
install only the QuickShelf menu.

NOTE: This problem can also occur if the system folder is inside another folder.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf, 1994 edition. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, make sure your system folder is named "System Folder".

If you do not want to rename your system folder, you can work around this problem
by doing a custom installation and installing everything except the QuickShelf
menu.

NOTE: If you use this workaround, you must be sure to specify only the
appropriate Bookshelf font set for your system. There are two Bookshelf font
sets available: "Bookshelf Fonts for System 7.1 or better", and "Bookshelf Fonts
for System 7.0 or 7.0.1". If you attempt to install both font sets, you will
receive an error message and the installation will fail.
