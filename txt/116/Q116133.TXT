TITLE   :PRB: /INFO or /VERBOSE Option May Delay Stopping a Build
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0,1.5,1.51,1.52,2.0,2.1,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Visual Workbench Integrated Debugger, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the /INFO option from Visual C++ for Windows or the /VERBOSE option from
Visual C++ 32-bit Edition may delay the Microsoft Visual Workbench from stopping
the build process during the linking phase of the build.

CAUSE
=====

The /INFO and /VERBOSE options display a great deal of information, and the
Visual Workbench attempts to display this information. As a result, the Visual
Workbench is "too busy" to actually stop the build. In some cases, the Visual
Workbench does receive the Stop Build message, but displays the remaining link
information before it processes the Stop Build message.

This problem appears more often when using the Visual Workbench for Windows than
when using the Visual Workbench 32-bit Edition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Microsoft products listed
above. We are researching the problem and will post new information in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as soon as it becomes available.
