TITLE   :WD97: Character Formatting in Data Source Not Retained In Merge

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Formatted characters in a mail merge data source, such as superscripted or
subscripted characters, will not retain their formatting after the data is
merged with the main document.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Word allows you to format the merge fields in the mail merge main
document. Formatting that is applied to the data source is overridden by
formatting applied to the fields in the main document.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Change the Main Document Mergefield
---------------------------------------------

Remove the word "MERGEFIELD" from the merge fields in the main document. To do
this, display field codes by pressing ALT+F9. Delete the word "MERGEFIELD" from
within the field code. Ignore the "Error! Bookmark not defined" error message
and perform the merge.

Method 2: Use Equation Editor
-----------------------------

To maintain superscript or subscript formatting, use the Equation Editor to
create the superscript or subscript characters in the data source.

Method 3: Use a REF Field
-------------------------

For the data field that contains special character formatting, insert a REF field
in your main document instead of a MERGEFIELD field. For example, in place of
the following MERGEFIELD field

   {MERGEFIELD Fieldname}

insert the following REF field instead:

   {REF Fieldname}

Word retains the data document formatting for the results of the REF field, which
preserves the special character formatting. The drawback to this workaround is
that the mail merge helper does not detect errors or suppress blank lines for
this field. If you use this workaround, you must suppress blank lines and
resolve any mail merge errors manually for the REF field.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
