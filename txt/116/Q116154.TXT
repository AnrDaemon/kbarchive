TITLE   :Source File Attribute Changes When Copying in Real Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy a file across the network, the attribute of the source file is
changed to Archive status.

CAUSE
=====

When a source file that has no attributes is copied over the network, the
Archive attribute is set on the file as soon as the copy process is complete.
This behavior occurs only in real mode and only when the network services are
started using the NET START BASIC command.

The Archive attribute is applied to copies of files by design; it is set to
accommodate backup utilities. The attributes on the source file, however, should
not be changed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups version
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
