SYMPTOMS

Once you have entered a name into the Complete Baseball Trivia game's list of
players, you cannot change or delete it.

The Best Players list in the Trivia game has a limit of 50 player names. If the
Best Players list already contains 50 names, the player with the lowest score is
removed from the end of the list when a new player is added.

NOTE: The Type Player Name dialog box can contain more than 50 player names.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only way to remove a name in the list of players is to delete the file that
contains the complete player list. This removes all player names and names from
the Best Player list. The file name is Quiz.his and is located in the Baseball
folder.
