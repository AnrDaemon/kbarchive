TITLE   :BUG: Conditional Breakpoint Doesn't Break on CodeView Restart
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you (1) use "Break At Location If Expression Has Changed", (2) run your
application in CodeView for Windows, and then (3) restart the debugging session,
you may find that the conditional breakpoint is no longer hit.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, clear the breakpoint and reset it after restarting
the debugging session. If you have Visual C++, you can also use its integrated
debugger because it does not have this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in CodeView for Windows. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as soon as it becomes available.

This problem does not occur under CodeView for MS-DOS or the Visual Workbench
debugger.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample program below demonstrates this bug. After building a Windows debug
version, load the program into CodeView for Windows and type these commands into
the command window:

   >p2
   >bp .16,=S.uc
   >g
   >l
   >g

The bp command sets a breakpoint at line 16 if S.uc has changed; g runs the
application; the l command restarts the application.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed:  /G2 /GA /Zi /Od
   */ 

      #include <windows.h>

      #define UCHAR unsigned char

      void main( void )
      {
       struct tagS
       {
        UINT  ui;
        UCHAR uc;
        LONG  li;
       } S;

       S.ui = 45;
       S.uc = 65;
       S.li = 100000L;
      }
