SUMMARY
=======

For versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, if the password for
the directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) server postoffice for each requestor
definition (the Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Requestor menu) is null (that is,
there is no password), the server accepts any password from any requestor
postoffice.

Setting the Dir-Sync server password to null means the server will accept any
password from any requestor. This allows the administrator to allow the Dir-Sync
server to accept input from any requestor, regardless of that requestor's
particular Dir-Sync password.

In this manner, the Microsoft Mail administrator can effectively disable the
Dir-Sync password option without having to change the individual passwords on
each requestor postoffice.
