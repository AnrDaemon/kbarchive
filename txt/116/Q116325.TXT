The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5, 4.0a, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When browsing for the definitions and references for a member variable of a
class, one of the references refers to the last brace in the destructor of the
class.

CAUSE
=====

The compiler is emitting a reference for this variable in the class destructor.
There is an implicit reference to the variable at this point, but not an
explicit source-code reference. Therefore, the compiler should not be emitting
the reference information.

RESOLUTION
==========

 

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Perform the following steps to reproduce this problem:

1. Build a test application called "Test", using AppWizard (default settings).

2. Edit TESTDOC.H and add a member variable to the CTestDoc class as follows:

      // Attributes
      public:
          CString Hello; // add this line

3. Edit TestDoc.cpp and initialize the member variable in the OnNewDocument
   member function:

      BOOL CTestDoc::OnNewDocument()
      {
          if (!CDocument::OnNewDocument())
              return FALSE;

          Hello = "Hello World"; // add this line
          return TRUE;
      }

4. Build the program and open Microsoft Browser.

5. Query the Definitions and References for "CTestDoc::Hello".

The first reference to CTestDoc::Hello found in TESTDOC.CPP actually points to
the ending brace of the CTestDoc destructor. Only the second reference is
correct, pointing to the source code reference that was added in the
CTestDoc::OnNewDocument() function.
