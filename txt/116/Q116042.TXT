TITLE   :Compatibility Layer Doesn't Support Some Paradox 4.x Types
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Jet 2.0/Visual Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer for Visual Basic
version 3.0 provides an updated Paradox ISAM driver that allows access to
Paradox 4.x tables. However, the following Paradox 4.x data types are not
supported by the Paradox ISAM driver. Therefore, fields that use these data
types will not be available in Visual Basic:

 - BINARY BLOB (type B)

 - FORMATTED MEMO (type F)

 - GRAPHIC BLOB (type G)

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to open a Paradox 4.x table that contains a field that has an
unsupported data type, that field will be ignored by Visual Basic. The field
will not appear at all in the fields collection of any Visual Basic data access
object (tabledef, table, dynaset, or snapshot).

NOTE: Visual Basic does recognize and work with Paradox OLE BLOB fields, just not
BINARY BLOB or GRAPHIC BLOB fields.
