TITLE   :FIX: >251 Character Lines in Workbench Cause Random Behavior
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVCkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51 
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Visual Workbench does not allow a user to type more than 251
characters on a single line. Depending on the version, the Visual Workbench will
either truncate the line past the 251 character limit or ask if the offending
line(s) should be wrapped onto the next line. This behavior can cause problems
in resource files (.RC files) or other project files in which the addition of a
carriage return is undesirable.

In Visual C++ for Windows versions 1.0, 1.5 and 1.51, it is possible to load a
file with more than 251 characters on a single line. In this case unexpected
results can occur, including the following:

 - A search-and-replace on the >251-character line may result in a general
   protection fault.

-or-

 - Editing the >251-character line may change the color of the background or
   text in the edit window.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, you must shorten line length to 251 characters or
less.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition,
version 4.0.
