The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.01, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for OS/2, versions 1.01, 1.11, 1.12, 1.21

SYMPTOMS
========

You can include files in an NMAKE makefile by using the !INCLUDE directive.
However, if an error is found by NMAKE in an included file, an incorrect line
number is reported by NMAKE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug with NMAKE for MS-DOS, versions 1.0,
1.01, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, and NMAKE for OS/2, versions 1.01,
1.11, 1.12, and 1.21. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code below for the two files, TEST.NMK and TEST1.NMK, can be used to
illustrate this problem. Make sure these two files are in the same directory.
The error message produced is:

   TEST1.NMK(2) : fatal error U1001: syntax error : illegal character
   '$' in macro

Sample Code
-----------

   /* NMAKE options needed: /f test.nmk
   */ 

      TEST.NMK
      --------
      !include test1.nmk

      TEST1.NMK
      ---------
      test = $($(XXX))
