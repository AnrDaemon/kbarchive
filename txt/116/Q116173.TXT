SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot install the new Hewlett-Packard (HP) 560C printer driver by running
Windows Control Panel, choosing the Printers icon, and choosing Unlisted Or
Updated Printer.

According to HP, you can install the 560C printer driver by choosing Run from the
File menu in Program Manager, typing "a:\hpsetup.exe" (without the quotation
marks), and then choose OK. For more information about installing the 560C
printer driver, contact HP.

The HP BBS is 208-344-1691 and the filename is D5WN31.EXE. The file date is
5/9/94 and it installs properly for WFW 3.11. It doesn't replace printman.exe or
commctrl.dll, even though the HP dates are newer. The HP installation
HPSETUP.EXE from the file D5WN31.EXE will not let you configure for more than
one LPT port for any of the individual printer drivers that are supplied with
D5WN31.EXE.
