TITLE   :BUG: /N1 Switch Does Not Function Properly in CodeView
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER::4.0,4.01,4.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

CodeView, versions 4.0, 4.01, and 4.1, always traps non-maskable interrupts
(NMI) in programs being debugged, regardless of whether you use the /N0 or /N1
CodeView options, which are supposed to trap NMIs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in CodeView for MS-DOS. We are
researching this problem and will post more information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the sample code below to demonstrate this problem. Build the
application for debug mode and load it into CodeView, version 4.10, using the
/N1 switch. When the program is run by pressing F5, the NMI breakpoint is
reported and the program breaks.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed:  /Zi
   */ 

      #include <stdio.h>

      void main( void )
      (
          _asm int 2;
          printf( "Hello World.\n" );
      }
