TITLE   :BUG: LINK Creates Zero-Size File if Insufficient Disk Space
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.5,5.60.22
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.5, 5.60.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to link an executable file and place the resulting file on a disk
that does not have enough free space available causes Microsoft LINK to create
an executable file with a size of 0 bytes. LINK does not issue any warnings or
error messages when this happens.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure there is enough available space on the target disk for the executable
file being built.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual C++ for Windows, versions
1.0 and 1.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

This is not a problem in Visual C++ 32-bit Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The version of LINK provided with Visual C++ 32-bit Edition issues the following
error message when it is unable to create an executable because of insufficient
disk space:

   error LNK1108: cannot write file at 0x1000

Additional query words: 5.50
