-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The External Mail program contains undocumented EXTERNAL.INI file entries
equivalent to the -Qx command-line options.

The following EXTERNAL.INI file entries are meant for advanced developers and
product support personnel to help them debug programs and troubleshoot problems.
Because of the technical and cryptic nature of the reports, they can be
misleading to less technical users. These entries are designed to be used in
conjunction with the documented LogVerbose and LogSession entries.

The four EXTERNAL.INI file entries are as follows:

DebugMessages
-------------

This entry is equivalent to the -Q1 command-line option. It reports detailed I/O
activity when EXTERNAL.EXE is scanning and delivering mail.

DebugXCSI
---------

This entry is equivalent to the -Q2 command-line option. It reports additional
information that is useful for troubleshooting modem problems. For more detailed
information, see Knowledge Base article Q80272.


DebugP1
-------

This entry is equivalent to the -Q3 command-line option. It reports the state of
the P1 files.

NOTE: The -Q3 option was not available prior to Mail 3.0.

DebugMemoryUsage
----------------

This entry is equivalent to the -Q4 command-line option. It does not log any
information into the SESSION.LOG file, but displays memory usage on the
EXTERNAL.EXE screen. The critical information is the value of the field
beginning with "F" in the upper-left corner of the screen.
