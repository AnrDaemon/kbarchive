SUMMARY
=======

The available open file formats in BitEdit are dependent on the filters listed
in the WIN.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a list of file formats that BitEdit can open without the aid of
graphics filters added by other applications:

   DIB Microsoft Windows DIB
   RDI Microsoft RIFF DIB
   PCX PC Paintbrush
   GIF CompuServe GIF
   PIC Apple Macintosh PICT
   TGA Truevision
   AVI AVI (First Frame)

The list of open file formats on page 5-2 in the Video for Windows "User's Guide"
and in Video for Windows Help is misleading. BitEdit supports other graphic file
formats only if graphic filters have been installed by another application and
added to the [MS Graphic Import Filters] section of the WIN.INI file.

The following file formats are supported provided that Windows graphic filters
have been installed for these formats.

   PLT AutoCad Import
   CGM Computer Graphics Metafile
   WPG DrawPerfect
   EPS Encapsulated PostScript
   HGL HP Graphic Language
   DRW Micrografx Designer Plus/Draw
   WMF Microsoft Windows Metafile
   TIF Tagged Image File Format

NOTE: The Video for Windows software does not include filters for these file
formats.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install an application that adds the desired
Windows graphic filters, and rename the MMTOOLS.INI file in the Windows
directory. This allows BitEdit to rebuild the list of available graphic formats
in the MMTOOLS.INI file.
