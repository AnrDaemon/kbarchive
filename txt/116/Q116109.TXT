-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has reproduced the following problems with the 1.0 version of the NDIS
2.0 network card adapter driver, which ships with the Xircom Creditcard Ethernet
adapter:

 - Periodic disconnection from the network (this causes the failure of file
   copying operations)

 - Slow operation

 - Failure to recognize servers on the network

These problems occur if you are running LAN Manager version 2.2 or Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 or 3.11.

WORKAROUND
==========

Xircom Technical Support recommends that you use the ODI network card adapter as
a workaround. However, this solution alone does not resolve all the problems.

Microsoft recommends that you upgrade to the Xircom version 2.13 Flash BIOS for
the Creditcard Ethernet adapter and use version 2.00 of the updated Xircom NDIS
2.0 driver.

To obtain these upgrades, contact Xircom at (800) 874-4428, or download the
drivers from the Xircom bulletin board service (BBS) at (818) 878-7618.
