-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for the Macintosh 1994, 1995, 96-97 editions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have insufficient memory available, MIDI sounds and pronunciations in
Bookshelf will not be able to play. If there is insufficient memory, an
explanatory message should appear, but this does not always occur.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Bookshelf. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Bookshelf requires a minimum of 4 megabytes (MB) of RAM. If you have 4 MB of RAM
but are still experiencing problems playing MIDI sounds and pronunciations, try
to reduce the amount of memory used by your System, fonts, INITs, and so on. For
more information about optimizing your memory for use with Bookshelf, refer to
topic #2, "Memory Use," in the Bookshelf 1994 Readme file.
