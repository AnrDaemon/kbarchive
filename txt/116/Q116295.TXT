-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994 edition 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the WordPerfect Help option is turned on in Word for Windows, a page break
may be inserted into your document when you choose a QuickShelf button. If you
have a word selected in your document, the page break will replace the word.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, disable the Help for WordPerfect users, using the
following steps:

1. From the Tools menu in Word, choose Options.

2. Choose General options.

3. Clear the Help For WordPerfect Users check box.

4. Choose OK.

The following is another workaround:

1. For Word 6.0, add the following line to the WINWORD6.INI file:

   "wphelp=0" (without the quotation marks)

   -or-

2. For Word 2.0, add the following line to the WINWORD.INI:

   "wphelp=0" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

You should be able to highlight a word and, by pressing a QuickShelf button,
start Bookshelf and perform a search on the word (for example, to find a
definition of it).

However, if the WordPerfect Help option is turned on, a page break appears,
replacing the highlighted word. Bookshelf starts, but does not search on the
word.
