TITLE   :Starting SNA Server Causes Computer to Slow Down
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT SNA Server, several default shares are created with
permissions set to EVERYONE FULL CONTROL. Changing permissions on these
directories to something else can cause the SNA product to not function
correctly.

One symptom of this is that the system slows down when you start Windows NT after
you have modified permissions on the COMCFG share or file privileges on the
COM.CFG file.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server services (SnaBase, SnaServer, Link services) run under the local
system context and access the CONFIG file through UNC names
(\\SERVER\COMCFG\COM.CFG). If the EVERYONE users doesn't have full control
access, this causes the services to go into a loop trying to open COM.CFG.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Patch #8 (SNA20.P08 - update to SNADMOD.DLL) is modified to display a dialog
box that says COM.CFG cannot be opened, thus allowing the Windows NT server to
perform as usual. Later updates to the SNA Server 2.0 SNADMOD.DLL will also
include this fix.


WORKAROUND
==========

SNA Server 2.0 patches are located on:


 - Microsoft's Internet Server (FTP.MICROSOFT.COM)

    - BUSSYS\SNASRVR\SUP-ED\FIXES (supported)

    - BUSSYS\SNASRVR\UNSUP-ED\FIXES (unsupported)

Also, various hotfixed versions of Windows NT version 3.1 include an updated
SRV.SYS which will lead to similar problems mentioned above. The original
release of Windows NT version 3.1, and all official Service Pack #1 and #2
updates work fine.

However, the following version of <winnt>\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\SRV.SYS should
be avoided:

   U.S. Service Pack 2a version (shipped on the August and September 1994
   TechNet CD-ROM), which has a size of 193748.

STATUS
======

This problem is corrected by applying the regular U.S. Service Pack 2 or U.S.
Service Pack 3, which has a size of 193732.
