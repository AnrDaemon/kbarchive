SUMMARY
=======

In some situations, it may be desirable to remove the ability to create long
filenames on FAT partitions in Windows NT 3.5, such as if MS-DOS based disk
utilities are used regularly on the machine. Some MS-DOS based disk utilities,
such as DiskFix (part of PC Tools), may either eliminate the long filenames
created from Windows NT or actually delete the files with long names.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove the ability to create long filenames on FAT, use the Registry Editor
(REGEDT32.EXE). Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key, use the following path:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\Win31FileSystem

Change the entry to 1 and long filename support on FAT will be disabled when you
reboot your machine. To re-enable it, change the entry back to 0.
