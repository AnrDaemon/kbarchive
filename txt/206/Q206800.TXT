PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbInventory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server 2.0, you can force inventory to be taken on Windows
95/98 and Windows NT systems running the Systems Management Server client using
the following steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Systems Management.

2. Click the Components tab.

3. Select Hardware Inventory Agent.

4. Click Start Component.

The following message will appear:

   Hardware Inventory Agent will be started. This may take several minutes to
   complete.

The Hardware Inventory Agent will start and take inventory on this client.

NOTE: Taking hardware and software inventory is processor-intensive, so the
client may operate more slowly while inventory is taken.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Systems Management Server 1.x you could force inventory to be taken by
running the inventory agent with a /f switch (such as invdos /f or invwin32 /e
/f). In Systems Management Server 2.0, Microsoft introduced the Systems
Management (Smscfg.cpl) control panel tool to enable you to perform a number of
tasks, including forcing both hardware and software inventory.

Another method to force inventory is to use the Inventory Synchronizer tool,
InvSync.exe. This tool can be used to send a hardware or software inventory
resynchronization request to a Systems Management Server 2.0 client. It is
located on the Systems Management Server 2.0 CD-ROM in the \Support\Reskit\Bin
subdirectory. More information about the tool can be found in the Tools.htm file
located in the \Support\Reskit subdirectory.

The syntax for the tool is as follows:

   C:\>invsync [hw | sw] client_NetBiosName

Example:

   C:\>invsync hw SMSClient1

NOTE: This tool cannot send a resynchronization request to a client that belongs
to a child site. The Inventory Synchronizer tool can only be run from a Systems
Management Server site server to force inventory for a client that reports
directly to the site the tool is executed on.
