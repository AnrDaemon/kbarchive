A Single-Threaded Apartment (STA) is a thread that was initialized with
CoInitialize() or CoInitializeEx (NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED). Also, any
other threads in the same process that use COM must also call CoInitialize() or
CoInitializeEx() to initialize COM for its thread.

If you create a COM object in one STA thread, you cannot pass an interface
pointer to another STA thread and call out on that pointer. Since calls to STA
objects are supposed to be serialized, COM enforces this by only allowing one
thread to call into the STA object (the thread where it was created). If the
interface pointer you pass to the second STA thread is a pointer to a proxy, you
will get an error HRESULT of 0x8001010E or RPC_E_WRONG_THREAD (the application
called an interface that was marshalled for a different thread). If the
interface pointer is a direct pointer to the object, COM will not enforce
serialization, you will not get the above error, and the interface method call
will be made. However, this is still illegal behavior on the part of the
client.

You can still call methods on the STA object from a different STA thread as long
as you do it through a proxy. A proxy is a copy of the interface that you get
via marshaling/unmarshaling. When you make a call through the proxy, COM makes a
thread switch and the call ends up executing in the context of the thread where
the STA object was created.

There are three ways to marshal/unmarshal an interface to another STA thread:

1. CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream() and CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream():
   One drawback to using this method is the interface can only be unmarshaled
   once. That is, if you need access to the same object from several STA
   threads, this method won't work.

2. CoMarshalInterface() and CoUnMarshalInterface(): This method is more flexible
   since you can marshal the interface once and unmarshal the interface as many
   times as you like; for example, specifying MSHLFLGS_TABLEWEAK or
   MSHLFLGS_TABLESTRONG when marshaling the interface. But it also requires more
   code since you have to create the IStream, set the seek pointer and clean up
   the marshal packet via CoReleaseMarshalData(). When marshaling pointers to a
   proxy you must have Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 or later, Windows 98 or
   Windows 95 with DCOM 1.2 or later installed. Also when using the
   MSHLFLGS_TABLESTRONG flag you must have Windows 2000 or later.

3. Global Interface Table(GIT): The GIT is a COM object that allows you to store
   an interface in one STA thread and get access to it's proxy in another STA
   thread. This is only available with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or later,
   Windows 98 or Windows 95 with DCOM 1.1 or later installed.

Marshal.exe contains TSTMARSH which is the main project. This contains an ATL EXE
server that implements ITest. ITest has one method called ToUpper(), which
converts a string to uppercase. A sub-project called Client is also included.
Client.cpp is where all the marshaling/unmarshaling methods are shown. Each
method creates an instance of the Test object, marshals an ITest interface and
creates a thread. In each thread, an ITest interface is unmarshaled and the
method ToUpper() is called to convert a string. You should see the output in the
debug window of: "THIS IS OUTPUT FROM THREAD #N".
