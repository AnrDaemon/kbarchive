The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Systems Management Server 2.0 on a client computer, the Remote
Control component may not install. The Systems Management tool in Control Panel
indicates that the Remote Control component is not available.
NOTE: If you have not completely uninstalled Systems Management Server 1.2
clients, you may have legacy component files on the local hard disk. If you do
have legacy components, you may receive the following error message:

   Client XXX quit installing REMOTE TOOLS because Third Party Remote Control
   System Detected

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you have existing legacy or third-party remote control
components or Microsoft Windows Terminal Server installed. If any of these
components are found during the Remote Control installation, the component is
set to Not Available. The remainder of the SMS client installation is not
affected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Uninstall Microsoft Windows Terminal Server.

2. Delete all the Termsrv.exe files found on your local hard disks.

3. Uninstall Remote Control

4. Delete all the Wuser.exe and Wuser32.exe files found on your local hard
   disks.

5. Reinstall Systems Management Server 2.0 client.

NOTE: The Remote Control client component cannot be installed on a Windows
Terminal Server.
