======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a new style with a customized bulleted or numbered format (on the
Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering), an extra tab setting may be included
with the style when you add the style to the template.

NOTE: To view the description of your custom style, click Style on the Format
menu, click to select your custom style in the Style dialog box, and then view
the Description.

For additional information about a similar problem when you create a custom style
that contains an outline numbered format, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q173070 WD97: Unwanted Tab Stop Inserted in Outline Numbered Sequence


CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design in Microsoft Word when you use the "Add to
template" option when you create a new custom style. Word automatically adds an
additional 0.25" value to the tab that follows the bullet or number of the
bulleted or numbered style that you customized.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Use the Organizer
---------------------------

Use the Organizer to copy the new custom style to your template. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Style.

2. In the Style dialog box, click Organizer.

3. On the Styles tab, open the document that contains your custom style on one
   side, and open the template to which you want to copy the style on the other
   side.

4. On the document side, click to select the style that you want to copy, and
   then click Copy. Your new custom style will be copied to the template that
   you specified.

5. Click Close to close the Organizer dialog box.

Method 2: Create the Style in Your Custom Template
--------------------------------------------------

Instead of creating your custom style in a Word document and selecting the Add to
template check box, open your template and create the custom style directly in
the template, just as you would in a Word document. For more information about
how to create a custom style, please see the "More Information" section of this
article.
