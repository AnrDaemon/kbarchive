TITLE   :PRB: Query Designer Expression Builder Uses Wrong MIN() / MAX()
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBuilder kbDesigner kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600 kbXBase kbQuery kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Selecting the MIN(,) and MAX(,) functions in the expression builder of the Query
Designer gives the incorrect format of the command. This results in the
following error when trying to verify the expression:

   Function Name is Missing ).

CAUSE
=====

The expression builder incorrectly adds a comma to the function. The MIN() and
MAX() functions used in SQL receive only one parameter, while the native Visual
FoxPro MIN(,) and MAX(,) functions compare multiple parameters passed. For more
information on the differences between the commands, please see the "References"
section below.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you select either the MIN() or MAX() command in the expression builder,
remove the comma and use only one parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Query Designer.

2. Click the Expression Builder at the Functions and Expressions box in the
   lower left corner.

3. From the Math drop-down list box, select MIN(,) or MAX(,).

4. Place a numeric expression on each side of the comma.

5. Click the Verify button (which causes the error mentioned above) or try
   adding the expression to the Selected fields list box (which places quotes
   around the expression).
