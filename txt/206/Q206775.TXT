PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1,1.2,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install System Management Server's Network Monitor or the
time-stamped PSS version of Network Monitor from the Microsoft ftp Web site, the
setup program may stop responding (hang) and not respond when you try to use
Task Manager.

When you attempt to end the task in Task Manager, you may receive the following
error message:

   The System cannot end the selected task because WOWEXEC is not allowing it to
   run.
   Press OK to End Task WOWEXEC or Cancel to leave it running.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, perform the following steps:

1. When you receive the error message, click OK to close the Microsoft Network
   Monitor Setup program.

2. Start the Control Panel Services tool, and stop the System Attendant
   Service.

   NOTE: This stops all of the Exchange Services.

3. From Disk1, run the Microsoft Network Monitor Setup program again.

4. After the Setup program has finished, restart the Exchange services, or
   restart the Exchange server to restart the Exchange services automatically.

NOTE: When you install Network Monitor on a computer on which the Network Monitor
agent is not installed, you are prompted to install the agent.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Network Monitor is a tool that you can use to troubleshoot
network-related problems. You may need to install this tool on your Exchange
Server computer.
