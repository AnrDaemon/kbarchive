======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Courier Sender Manager does not verify the contents of a parcel when writing
and reading the media. Parcels that are incompletely written to the media, or
modified after being written to the media, will be received with a success
status at the destination site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are some known conditions that may cause an invalid parcel:

 - The media does not have enough free space to record the whole parcel.

 - The media is removed before the complete parcel is written.

 - The media is modified after the parcel is written to it.
