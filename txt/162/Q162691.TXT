KEYWORDS:kbualink97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a document while only the summary is visible, if you close and
then reopen the document, the text in your document may appear to be missing.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you use the AutoSummarize feature and select the "Hide
everything but the summary without leaving the original document" option.


RESOLUTION
==========

To retrieve the document text that "disappeared" when you saved the summary, use
these steps:

1. Open the document.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the View tab.

3. Under Nonprinting characters, click to select the Hidden Text check box.

4. Click OK.

The dotted underlines beneath some of your text indicate hidden font formatting.
To remove this formatting, use these steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

2. On the Format menu, click Font, and click the Font tab.

3. Click to clear the Hidden check box. Click OK.

To prevent this problem from occurring again, use any of the following options
before you save and close your document:

 - Use one of the other AutoSummarize options ("highlight key points,"
   "executive summary or abstract," or "add the summary to a new document").

 - Click the Close button on the AutoSummarize toolbar.

 - Click the Highlight/Show Only Summary button on the AutoSummarize toolbar.

 - Click Undo on the Edit menu.
