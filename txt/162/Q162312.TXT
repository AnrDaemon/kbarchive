TITLE   :FP: Images Not Saved to Web Aren't Loaded
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:windows:97; macintosh:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse a page using a Web browser or open a page in FrontPage Editor,
the image does not load.

CAUSE
=====

The image does not load if you clicked No in the "Save Image to FrontPage Web"
dialog box that appears when you save your page. The IMG SRC tag contains a path
to the location--usually the same folder as the rest or your Web content--where
the image would have been saved if you clicked Yes in the "Save Image to
FrontPage Web" dialog box. Since the image is not stored in this location, the
image is not loaded when you load the page in a Web browser or when you open the
page in FrontPage Editor.

RESOLUTION
==========

Click Yes or Yes To All in the "Save Image to FrontPage Web" dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, FrontPage prompts you to save images in the same directory where you
save your Web page. If you specify a different location for the image than you
specify for the page, FrontPage Editor will suggest the new directory the next
time you save a page that includes a new image.
