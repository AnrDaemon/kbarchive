 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 4.0

You cannot modify the day or time of a recurring appointment series after the

or time for non-recurring appointments and for recurring tasks.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete the recurring appointment series and create
a new one or modify each individual occurrence of the appointment.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
