TITLE   :PRB: SourceSafe Commands not Available for RunCommand Method
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

You can use the new RunCommand method to execute menu commands in Microsoft
Access 97, and, in general, most of the application's functionality is available
using this method.

However, the RunCommand method does not expose the menu commands to control
Visual SourceSafe Integration from either Visual Basic for Applications code or
macros.

This article assumes that you are familiar with using the client-side
capabilities of Visual SourceSafe. For more information about Visual SourceSafe,
please refer to the "Visual SourceSafe User's Guide" or Help topics available
from the Visual SourceSafe menu.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Access 97 does not expose a programmatic interface to Visual
SourceSafe integration.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can control Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version 5.0 using OLE Automation
from Visual Basic for Applications code. You can obtain information concerning
this functionality by searching for Visual SourceSafe on the Microsoft home page
on the World Wide Web at:

   http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
