KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbvfp kbvfp300bBUGkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When importing an Excel 5.0 for Macintosh spreadsheet or an Excel 7.0 for
Windows 95 spreadsheet containing blank cells with the Import Wizard, the
resulting fields in the new table contain zeros. This behavior occurs regardless
of the value of the SET NULL command.

RESOLUTION
==========

Issue a SET NULL ON command and use the IMPORT command. You can also use the
APPEND FROM ... Type XL5 command after creating a table that supports null
numeric values.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
