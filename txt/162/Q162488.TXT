TITLE   :Err Msg: You Cannot Copy "File Name" Onto the Shared Disk...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After setting up Services for Macintosh, users can mount the Microsoft User
Authentication Module (UAM) volume on the Macintosh clients. However, attempts
to copy a file on to the UAM volume result in the following message on the
Macintosh client:

   You cannot copy "file name" onto the shared disk "Microsoft UAM Volume",
   because the disk is locked.

The NTFS and Macintosh file permissions look fine.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the UAM volume is read-only.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make the UAM volume read/write. To do so, follow these
steps:

Windows NT Server 3.51
----------------------

1. Start File Manager.

2. On the MacFile menu, click View/Modify Volumes.

3. Click to clear the "This Volume is read-only" check box.

NOTE: When you install the Services for Macintosh on Windows NT Server 4.0, File
Manager is added to the Administrative Tools menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Only the UAM volume is read-only by default; any other Macintosh volumes that
are created will not be read-only. Note that it is recommended that you leave
the UAM volume read-only because leaving it read-only prevents any user from
modifying the UAM files.
