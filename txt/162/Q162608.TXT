TITLE   :Cannot Start OSR2 After Installing Retail Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install the retail version of Windows 95 (version 950) on a computer that
already has Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) installed, Windows 95 may
not start.

CAUSE
=====

The core components of the retail version of Windows 95 and OSR2 are not
compatible.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall OSR2 from a command prompt into the current Windows folder or into an
empty folder. Note that if you reinstall OSR2 into an empty folder, you will
have to reinstall all your programs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you reinstall OSR2, use the OSR2 CD-ROM provided by your original equipment
manufacturer (OEM). If you do not have an OSR2 CD-ROM, your OEM may have
provided a flat folder on your hard disk with files to install OSR2. To locate
this folder, type the following command at a command prompt:

   "dir *.cab /s" (without the quotation marks)

To reinstall OSR2, run Setup.exe from the folder containing the cabinet (.cab)
files.

Contact your OEM for assistance if:

 - You do not have an OSR2 CD-ROM and you cannot locate a folder with the
   cabinet files.

 - You cannot locate the Setup.exe file in the folder that contains the cabinet
   files.

If you try to install the retail version of Windows 95 from the Windows 95 CD-ROM
on a computer with OSR2 installed and the Auto Insert Notification option
enabled, the Add/Remove Software option on the Autorun menu is disabled, and you
receive the following warning:

   This CD-ROM is from an older version of Windows than the one you are
   presently using. Setup functionality from this disk will be disabled.

A warning does not appear if:

 - The Auto Insert Notification option is disabled, and you are installing from
   a CD-ROM.

 - You choose to browse the CD-ROM.
