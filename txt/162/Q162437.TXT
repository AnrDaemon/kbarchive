-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you save a document in Rich Text Format (RTF) and then reopen it, the Normal
style will have an extra language property associated with it. To see this extra
language property, select some text formatted with the Normal style, click Style
on the Format menu, and look in the Description section of the Style dialog
box.

In general, the Normal style is associated with the English (United States)
language property. However, when you save a document in RTF format and then
re-open the document in Word 97, the Language property for the Normal style will
be changed to (FE) English (United States) and (Other) English (United States).

NOTE: This behavior is different from earlier versions of Word. Note also that
this problem does not occur if you create a custom style with a language
property and then save the file in RTF.

CAUSE
=====

Word 97 stores multiple language tags for the Normal style. Saving a file to RTF
exposes these settings, and they become visible when you reopen the document and
view the language settings of the Normal style.
