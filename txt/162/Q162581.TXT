SUMMARY
=======

The Print Server service in Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 allows print
sessions to be configured to specify the type of font that the printer will use
to print the job.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Font Override option only overrides the typeface of the font used for print
jobs. You cannot force a job to have a particular size of font even though the
font selection dialog displays a Font Size selection. Any font size selected in
this dialog will be ignored.

The size of font to use for each job is decided dynamically by the print server
according to the number of columns that the print job has and according to
commands that may be in the printer data-stream.

Note: The print session override options are available in the Printer Session
Properties dialog under the Printing tab in SNA Server Manager.
