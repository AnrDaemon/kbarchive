TITLE   :PRB: Icons on Controls Have Garbled White Area to Right/Below
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbvfp500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use icons on command buttons, graphical-style checkboxes, or
graphical-style radio buttons, a garbled area appears to the right and/or below
the icon. The icon looks OK, but to the right and/or below a white area usually
appears.

CAUSE
=====

This happens when you use a Windows video driver that is set up to use large
fonts.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a bitmap file instead of an icon file. Bitmap files show up correctly. The
other option is to set the video driver to use small fonts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The white area to the right and/or below the icon can vary in size and shape.
Resizing the object usually changes the shape of the white area. Sometimes the
white area has vertical lines in it. Other times, the white area shows up as
white horizontal lines to the right and/or below the icon. The same icon file
appears properly when it is placed on an object in Visual FoxPro 3.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Windows 95 or Windows NT, open the Display control panel and click the
   Settings tab. Make sure that the Font Size is set to Large Fonts. Restart the
   computer, if necessary, to make this change take effect. Typically, the video
   resolution needs to be set to at least 600x800 for the font size option to be
   available.

2. In Visual FoxPro, create a new form.

3. Place a command button on the new form.

4. Set the Caption property of the command button to blank (nothing).

5. Set the Picture property of the command button to an icon file. Some good
   icon files to use can be found in the HOME() + Samples\Graphics\Icons
   directory.

6. Resize the button as necessary to see the white area.
