KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows 95 with the Microsoft NetWare client and an application is
executed on a Windows NT Server running File and Print Services for NetWare, the
application is not displayed correctly. This problem does not occur when you
execute an application from Novell NetWare version 3.x or 4.x or when you use
Windows NT Workstation with the Microsoft NetWare client or Windows 95 with the
Novell 32-bit client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the client sends the wrong task ID, the NetWare server, by default, ignores a
close and sends back success. Windows NT File and Print Services actually close
the file, causing problems for the application later when it tries to read the
file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

information on the availability of this fix.
