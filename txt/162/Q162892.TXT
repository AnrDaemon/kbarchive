TITLE   :Problems Adding Second Drive to Dual Channel EIDE/PCI
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding an IDE drive to the second channel of an onboard EIDE/PCI
controller, Windows NT may not recognize the device. If you configure the drive
as a slave and add it to the primary channel, Windows NT may produce the
following error during system startup:

   STOP 0x7B INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by incompatibilities between the onboard dual channel
EIDE/PCI controller and the Windows NT 3.51 Atapi.sys driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the compatibility problem, perform the following steps:

1. Install the new IDE drive on the second IDE channel as the master.

2. Make sure that a copy of Atdisk.sys is in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers
   directory.

3. Use Control Panel Devices to start ATDISK and set the startup option to
   System.

4. Run Disk Administrator from the Administrative Tools group and assign a drive
   letter to the new drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some systems that exhibit this problem may function properly with the latest
service pack for Windows NT 3.51. Other systems may require you to install
Windows NT version 4.0 to achieve full functionality.
