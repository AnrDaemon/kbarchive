TITLE   :If 1st Thunked LUA App Is Closed, Other LUA Calls Not Processed
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In a case where two or more 16-bit LUA applications are using the thunked LUA
library, the library no longer processes any LUA verbs once the first
application to start is closed (where WinSliCleanup() or WinRuiCleanup() was
issued).

CAUSE
=====

This is because the thunked library creates a window for processing asynchronous
messages in the first API call, and when the first application is closed, that
window is closed. However, all asynchronous notification messages are still sent
to that (now non-existent) window handle.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix referenced below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 and
2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1).


A supported fix is now available for SNA Server 2.11 SP1, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
