The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run (or attempt to modify after running) a Form that was created with
the Form Builder, the following error message appears:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

Select Details to reveal the following error:

   VFP caused a stack fault in module VFP.EXE ...

CAUSE
=====

One of the labels that was added by the Form Builder was modified so that both
the AutoSize and WordWrap properties are .T. (True).

RESOLUTION
==========

Before running a form where you have set both the AutoSize and WordWrap
properties on a label added by the Form Builder, right-click the Visible
property of the label and click "Reset to Default."

If you already ran the form and received the problem described in the "Symptoms"
section, type the following commands in the command window to correct the form
so that you can modify it and run it in the future.

NOTE: Spacing and case are important in the REPLACE command.

      scxfile = GETFILE('SCX', 'Locate your form')
      USE (scxfile)
      REPLACE ALL properties WITH ;
        STRTRAN(properties, "Visible = .T."+CHR(13)+CHR(10)) ;
        FOR "label" $ baseclass
      USE
