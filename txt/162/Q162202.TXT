PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhowto

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use one of the Encarta Online Features, you get the
following error message:

   Web Browser Setup

   Encarta Encyclopedia cannot connect to the World Wide Web.

 - If you've connected to the web from this computer before, click Browse and
   locate your Web browser.
 - If you've never connected to the Web before, click Help for more information.

CAUSE
=====

Encarta cannot start your Web browser. There are several reasons why this
occurs:

 - You do not have an Internet account and a working Web browser. The Online
   features in Encarta require that you have a working Internet Web connection.

   -or-

 - Your Web browser is an internal component of another program. There are some
   Web browsers that are not separate programs, but rather components of other
   software. Encarta will not be able to open these "internal" browsers. An
   example of this browser is AOL for Windows, which is included with America
   Online.

   -or-

 - You are using a Windows 3.1 or 16 bit Web browser. You need to tell Encarta
   where this program is by clicking on the Browse button.

   -or-

 - Your Web browser is not installed correctly. If you are using Internet
   Explorer for Windows 95, or Netscape Navigator for Windows 95, install the
   browser again to make sure that it is properly registered in Windows.
