TITLE   :BUG: GetSetting Causes GP Fault in Vba2.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the GetSetting Function in Visual Basic 4.0, 16-bit, you may
receive a General Protection Fault in Module Vba2.dll at 0011:360C. This error
is likely to occur if you use an uninitialized, variable-length string as the
argument for the default value of GetSetting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, use a fixed-length string or assign a value to the
string. For example, modify the Load event code of Form1 in step 2 of the Steps
to Reproduce Problem section of this article to the following:

      Dim DefaultValue As String
      DefaultValue = ""
      Call GetSetting ("MyINI", "SectionName", "KeyValue", DefaultValue)

-or-

      Dim DefaultValue As String * 40
      Call (GetSetting "MyINI", "SectionName", "KeyValue", DefaultValue)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0, 16-bit Edition. Form1 is created by default.
