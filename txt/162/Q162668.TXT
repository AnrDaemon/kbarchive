The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Windows\Options and Windows\Options\Cabs folders in
OEM releases of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Windows 95 was preinstalled on your computer, there may be Windows\Options
and Windows\Options\Cabs folders on the hard disk. The files in these folders
serve the following purposes:

 - If you did not receive a Windows 95 CD-ROM with your computer, these files
   are used by the Create System Disks program to create a floppy- disk backup
   of the Windows 95 installation disks, should you need to reinstall Windows 95
   in the future.

 - When you add or remove a Windows 95 component using the Add/Remove Programs
   tool in Control Panel, Windows 95 Setup uses these files to complete the
   process instead of prompting you to insert your Windows 95 floppy disks or
   CD-ROM.

If you have not created your floppy-disk backup of Windows 95, do not delete
these files until you have done so.

If you already have a floppy-disk backup of Windows 95 (or if you received
Windows 95 on a CD-ROM), these files are provided as a convenience to you. If
you delete the files, you need to have your Windows 95 floppy-disk backup or
CD-ROM available whenever you change your Windows 95 system configuration.
