======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you paste or link a table from one place in a document to another, the
numbers in the pasted or linked table are updated to the next numbers in the
sequence.

CAUSE
=====

The functionality of numbering in Word has changed from previous versions of
Word. Word determines how to number lists based on an items relationship to
other numbered items in the document. No two items can have the same number.

NOTE: This functionality is different from previous versions of Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1
--------

Use manual numbering in the table. Do not use the numbering feature. Type the
numbering as you would the other text in the table.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To link a table to another part of your document, use the following steps:

1. Select the table by placing the insertion point anywhere in the table. On the
   Table menu, click Select Table.

2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

3. Move the insertion point to where you want the table to linked. On the Edit
   menu, click Paste Special.

4. In the Paste Special dialog box, click Paste Link. Under As, click Formatted
   Text (RTF), and then click OK.
