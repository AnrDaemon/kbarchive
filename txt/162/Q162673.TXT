TITLE   :FIX: ASCAN() Fails to Find Integer Value when Called in a Loop
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprogramming kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ASCAN() function may sometimes fail to find an integer value that is present
in the searched array when values within the searched array are changed in an
iterative loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, you can convert a value in the scanned array to a character
string, then back to a numeric data type, before issuing the ASCAN() function.

      laarraysearched[1] = STR(laarraysearched[1])
      laarraysearched[1] = INT(VAL(laarraysearched[1]))

This must be done in two separate program lines, not all in a single line as in
the following:

      laarraysearched[1] = INT(VAL(STR(laarraysearched[1])))

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ASCAN() function should return an element number if the value scanned for is
contained in the scanned array. Under specific circumstances, ASCAN() may return
a 0 (that is, the value is not found) when seeking an integer value if the
searched array has been repeatedly repopulated within an iterative loop. Under
these circumstances, ASCAN() functions properly in Visual FoxPro 3.0b.
