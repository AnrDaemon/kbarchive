SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Cancel in the Bullets And Numbering dialog box that appears when
you run a WordBasic macro that has been converted to a Visual Basic for
Applications macro that uses the FormatHeadingNumbering commands to display the
Bullets And Numbering dialog box, the macro skips the check for the action of
pressing Cancel.

CAUSE
=====

In Microsoft WordBasic you can check for a user clicking Cancel in a dialog box
by testing for a return value of zero. When the WordBasic object is used in
conjunction with a converted WordBasic macro, the value returned is -1 instead
of 0 when you click Cancel.

For example, the following code sample was converted from WordBasic to Visual
Basic for Applications:

      Sub Main()
         Dim dlg As Object
         Set dlg = WordBasic.DialogRecord.FormatHeadingNumbering(False)
         WordBasic.CurValues.FormatHeadingNumbering dlg
         x = WordBasic.Dialog.FormatHeadingNumbering(dlg)
         ' In WordBasic, if the Cancel button was pressed, x will equal zero.
         If x = 0 Then
            ' Because Visual Basic for Applications WordBasic object returns
            '  -1 for Cancel, any commands in this If...Then...Else statement
            ' will be skipped when Cancel is clicked.
            MsgBox "Cancel was pressed."
         End If
      End Sub

To work around this problem, check for the value of -1 instead of zero as in the
following example:

      Sub Main()
         Dim dlg As Object
         Set dlg = WordBasic.DialogRecord.FormatHeadingNumbering(False)
         WordBasic.CurValues.FormatHeadingNumbering dlg
         x = WordBasic.Dialog.FormatHeadingNumbering(dlg)
         ' If the Cancel button was pressed, x will equal -1.
         If x = -1 Then
            ' Perform actions based on the Cancel button being clicked.
         End If
      End Sub

NOTE: Using Visual Basic for Applications commands without the WordBasic object
returns zero for a Cancel button. For example, the following procedure performs
the same functionality as the converted WordBasic macro examples described
earlier in this article:

      Sub ShowDlg()
         ' Display the Bullets and Numbering Dialog.
         With Dialogs(wdDialogFormatBulletsAndNumbering)
            .DefaultTab = wdDialogFormatBulletsAndNumberingTabOutlineNumbered
            x = .Show
         End With
         ' If x=zero then the Cancel button was clicked.
         If x = 0 Then
            MsgBox "Cancel was pressed."
         End If
      End Sub
