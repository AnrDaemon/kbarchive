 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are using a system with an S3 M65 Aurora display chipset. After you install
or change display settings in Windows NT 4.0, part of the display area is
missing, including the taskbar.

CAUSE
=====

The Graphics mode is set to a resolution above 800x600.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the display resolution to a supported value
less than or equal to 800x600 by performing the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the Display icon.

2. Click the Settings tab.

3. Click to change the Desktop Area setting to 800x600 or less.

4. Click Test.

5. If the display settings are okay, accept the settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

Support for the S3 M65 Aurora chipset has been added to the S3 miniport/display
driver in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2. You may either change the resolution
setting to a supported value less than or equal to 800x600, or load the latest
Service Pack for Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the

MORE INFORMATION
================

The S3 miniport/display driver in Windows NT 4.0 does not correctly support the
S3 M65 Aurora chipset.

The S3 driver included with Windows NT 4.0 does not detect the size of the
display area. When a resolution higher than the maximum supported by the display
is selected, the display is expanded off of the viewable area of the screen.
