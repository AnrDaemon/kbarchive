======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add an existing Visual FoxPro for Windows 3.0 .vcx class library file
into a Visual FoxPro for Windows 5.0 project and attempt to modify an element of
the library, you may get the following error message:

   <path\library>.vcx is not an object file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a copy of the Visual FoxPro for Windows 3.0 class library .vcx file, and
then type the following in the command window:

   COMPILE CLASSLIB <path\library>.vcx

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compile Classlib compiles source code contained in a memo field named Methods,
and becomes compiled into object code that is stored in a memo field named
OBJCODE.

Source code for class libraries, stored procedures, and forms are stored in memo
fields either in the .vcx file table, the .dbc file table, or the .scx file
table. When each is compiled, the object code is placed into a separate memo
field. This object code is specific to the FoxPro version.

NOTE: Forms are automatically compiled when they are saved from the Form
Designer. If you open a Visual FoxPro for Windows 5.0 form in Visual FoxPro for
Windows 3.0, you will receive the following error message:

   Error loading file - Methods - record number 2. Object file from
   <path\form>.scx was compiled in a previous version of FoxPro.
