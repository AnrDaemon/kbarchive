TITLE   :SMS: Setup Switch "/noautoupgrade" Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbSCMan smssetup smssiteconfigmankbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When upgrading a Systems Management Server 1.1 site to version 1.2, the Systems
Management Server administrator may not want to have any secondary sites beneath
that primary site upgraded immediately. There is a documented command-line
switch, "/noautoupgrade", that should serve that need; however, it does not work
correctly. After the primary site is successfully upgraded to Systems Management
Server 1.2, the Systems Management Server Hierarchy Manager begins to upgrade
any secondary sites reporting to it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
