TITLE   :WINS May Report Database Corruption w/ More Than 100 Owners
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have configured a Windows NT 4.0 WINS server to pull records from more than
100 replication partners, or to participate in replication involving more than
100 owners.

On stopping and attempting to restart the WINS service, you observe the error
message:

   WINS could not come up due to missing/corrupt database. Restore the database
   using WINS Manager or Winscl.exe (in the res kit) and then restart WINS. If
   WINS still does not come up, start with a fresh copy of the database.

Restoring the database has no effect on the problem. The WINS service cannot be
restarted.

CAUSE
=====

The WINS service encountered an access violation when initializing, or when
pulling records from a replication partner.

NOTE: The WINS service does not create an event log entry and Dr. Watson does not
record the access violation.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly support configurations involving more than 100 owners or
replication partners, apply the fix mentioned below.
