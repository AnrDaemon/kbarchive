======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer equipped with advanced power management (APM), a "Fatal Exception
0E" error may occur in VPOWERD if a critical suspend occurs while the computer
is already in the process of suspending normally.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 power-management driver does not properly handle a new critical
suspend request while it is processing a normal suspend request.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue may occur if you manually suspend the computer when the computer's
battery is critically low. Under such conditions, the low- battery condition
could cause a critical suspend request to be issued by the computer's BIOS. If a
critical suspend request is issued while Windows 95 is already processing the
normal suspend request, the problem can occur.
