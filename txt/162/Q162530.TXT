The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, if the "Log all actions in Journal File"
(located on the Tools ... Options ... General tab) is set to a Bad or Non-
Existent path for client workstations, you might see one of the following
errors:

   Invalid Handle
   Invalid DOS path: <path to the journal file>

This occurs on the client workstation when you perform operations that log to the
journal file, such as check out or check in.

CAUSE
=====

When you set the "Log all actions in Journal File," it sets the Journal_File
variable in the Srcsafe.ini on the server. Clients access this file by the
Srcsafe.ini on the local workstation by responding to the #include < path to
server Srcsafe.ini > line.

Since the local Visual SourceSafe workstation uses the server settings when the
Journal_File path cannot be resolved (that is, the drive or directory structure
does not exist for that workstation), these errors result when the local Visual
SourceSafe workstation executes an operation that writes an entry into the
journal file.

RESOLUTION
==========

When setting a location for the journal file, make sure that all Visual
SourceSafe clients can see the path to the file. Microsoft network users or
users of networks supporting Universal Naming Convention (UNC) pathing should
consider using a UNC path to the journal file location. In cases where UNC
pathing is not desired or available, set a common drive mapping on all client
computers to the journal file location.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start the Visual SourceSafe Administrator. On the Tools menu, click Options
   and then click the General tab.

2. On the General tab, set the "Log all actions in Journal File" to Non-
   Existent Drive for the client workstation.

3. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, perform a check out or check in operation.

4. When the check out or check in operation attempts to write the details of the
   operation to the journal file, an Invalid Handle message occurs on the client
   workstation.
