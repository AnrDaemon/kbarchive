TITLE   :Unexpected Result in NCB Callname After Canceling a Listen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbNetBIOS kbSDKPlatform kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT NetBIOS application's network control block (NCB) may appear
corrupted. If Ncb.listen is posted with an asterisk (*) for the called name, the
string "nnection context" is returned in the NCB callname structure whenever
Ncb.listen is canceled before a client responds to it.

CAUSE
=====

The remote address of the client should be copied to the NCB structure on the
completion of the listen. However, because a client did not respond to the
listen, the unexpected string is copied to the structure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5x and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the NCB callname is not used when Ncb.listen is canceled, this problem
does not negatively affect NetBIOS applications.
