TITLE   :ACC97: SourceSafe Integration Alerts Do Not Use Office Assistant
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0a,5.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access 97 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multi-user skills.

This article assumes that you are familiar with using the client side
capabilities of Microsoft Visual SourceSafe. For more information about Visual
SourceSafe, please refer to the "Visual SourceSafe User's Guide" or the Help
topics available from the Visual SourceSafe menu.

Microsoft Access and Visual SourceSafe Integration do not use the Office
Assistant character when alerting you of errors or information.

CAUSE
=====

Visual SourceSafe is not a component of Microsoft Office and because of the
large number of other Microsoft products and development environments that
Visual SourceSafe integrates with, it retains its own internal specifications
for messages and alerts.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are error messages that you may receive while using Visual SourceSafe that
do use the Office Assistant character; however, these messages may be generated
by Microsoft Access 97 or the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine, rather than by
Visual SourceSafe.
