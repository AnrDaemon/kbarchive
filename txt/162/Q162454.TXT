SYMPTOMS
========

In Dial-Up Networking, the Operator Assisted and Manual Dial options may be
disabled.

CAUSE
=====

The modem type is set to Standard Modem.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Standard Modem setting is for modems that do not have specific drivers. The
capabilities of a modem using the Standard Modem setting are limited.

To modify the driver your modem is using, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.

2. Check the list of installed modems for a modem labeled "Standard Modem."

3. If Standard Modem is the only entry in the list, click Add, click Do Not
   Detect My Modem, and then click the modem's manufacturer in the Manufacturers
   box.

4. If the manufacturer is not listed, or the correct model does not appear when
   the manufacturer is selected, contact the manufacturer of the modem for
   information about a driver for the modem.
