TITLE   :SMS: Job Status MIF Processing Slow on Large JobDetails Table
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2,6.0,6.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase kbDataLoader smsdatabase smsdataloaderkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After many Job Status MIFs have been processed and loaded in the Systems
Management Server database, the time taken by the Dataloader to process job
status MIFs may increase significantly. In some cases, the increase in
processing time between a JobDetails table with 100 records and a JobDetails
table with 230,000 records may be as much as a factor of 50.

CAUSE
=====

The JobDetails table has an index on the MachineID column. However, in Job
Status MIF processing, this index is not used by the majority of queries made by
the Dataloader.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should
be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.
