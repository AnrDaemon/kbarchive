TITLE   :Identical Documents May Print Differently from Win 95 Clients
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Font sizes may appear to be slightly different on Windows 95 workstations
printing the same document to the same postscript printer that was created
through Point and Print from a computer running Windows NT Server.

CAUSE
=====

Point and Print will only create a Fonts.mfd file on a Windows 95 client if no
Fonts.mfd already exists. If there is another postscript printer or postscript
software is already installed on the computer running Windows 95, Fonts.mfd is
not modified by Point and Print.

This file is modified if a postscript printer is created and the driver is
installed by using the Windows 95 CD-ROM. The file is also modified if a test
page is printed while creating the printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
