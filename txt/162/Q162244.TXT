TITLE   :FP: Error 10053 After Quick, Repeated Operations on WebSite
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbinterop kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194258.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform many operations quickly or repeatedly, such as deleting and
creating webs on a WebSite server, you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to connect to server at <your_server_name> on port
   <your_server_port> (socket code 10053).

CAUSE
=====

When you delete a FrontPage Web on a WebSite server, FrontPage updates the
WebSite configuration files and sets a flag in the registry that instructs
WebSite to reread its configuration files. WebSite checks the flag whenever it
is idle. While it is rereading the configuration files, the Website server does
not accept connections, resulting in the error message described in the
"Symptoms" section.


WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid receiving this error message, allow the WebSite server time to process
the multiple operations and reread its configuration files. For example, allow
the Web Server to remain idle for about 10 seconds or restart the Web server.
(An idle state is one in which the server is not providing any data to connected
users. The quickest way to ensure that the server rereads its configuration
files is to restart it.)
