TITLE   :ADT/ODE: Custom Run-Time Setup Does Not Install Msaexp30.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a setup image for a custom run-time application, the Setup
Wizard automatically includes the file Msaexp30.dll; however, when you run your
custom Setup program, that file is not copied to the hard drive.

CAUSE
=====

The Msaexp30.dll file is not used by the run-time version of Microsoft Access
7.0 or 97.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because the file is not used by the run-time version of Microsoft Access, and
the file is not copied to your hard drive during Setup, no action is necessary.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools and Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Msaexp30.dll is the Microsoft Access Expression Builder DLL. Note that in
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools, this file is not included in the
list of files you are licensed to redistribute.

REFERENCES
==========

For a list of files you can redistribute with your run-time application, search
the Help Index for "files, distributing with run-time applications."
