TITLE   :Windows 95 Does Not Send DHCP Request Packet

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork dun win95 kbDialUp

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows 95 with a DHCP server to assign an IP address, you
may be unable to connect to or view network resources using TCP/IP.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the DHCP key in the registry contains eight MAC
address entries. When this occurs, a new one cannot be created for the current
session.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Obtain and install the Windows 95 Windows Sockets 2 Update. This update is
available at the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/contents/updates/
   w95sockets2/default.asp

For additional information about the Windows Sockets 2 Update, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base

   Q182108 Availability of Windows Sockets 2.0 for Windows 95

Method 2
--------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

Use Registry Editor to remove all the keys except for the Dhcpinfo00 key from the
following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\DHCP

After removing the keys, restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows stores the MAC addresses for each individual network adapter under the
DHCP key in the registry. The key for the MAC address (and other information) is
stored in a key in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\DHCP

When eight of these keys have been created (DhcpInfo00-DhcpInfo07), Windows 95
does not create a new key and does not send a DHCP Request packet to obtain an
IP address from the DHCP server. This problem primarily affects laptop computers
that are routinely plugged into different docking stations with network
adapters.
