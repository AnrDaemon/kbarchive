KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the shortcut for DriveSpace, Disk Defragmenter, or ScanDisk on
the Start menu, you may receive an error message stating that the target cannot
be found. When this occurs, the shortcuts are displayed with the default Windows
icon.

In addition, when you are running Setup for Microsoft Plus!, you may receive the
following error message:

   Setup Message
   Setup could not open the file:
   'C:\WINDOWS\DRVSPACE.EXE'

When you receive this message, you cannot successfully install Microsoft Plus!.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you have installed the Web.Max Security demonstration
from Berkley Systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

Uninstall the Web.Max Security demonstration before you run ScanDisk, Disk
Defragmenter, DriveSpace, or Microsoft Plus! Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can see the ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter, and DriveSpace files with the DIR
command when you start the computer in MS-DOS mode. However, the files cannot be
viewed using Windows Explorer or from an MS-DOS prompt in Windows 95.

The following files are known to be hidden by default by the Web.Max
demonstration:

   Scandisk.exe
   Cmpagent.exe
   Defrag.exe
   Chkdsk.exe
   Scandskw.exe
   Drvspace.exe

This list may vary depending on which programs and Windows 95 updates are
installed on your computer.


Note that the symptoms described in this article have been confirmed with the
demonstration version of Web.Max Security, but not with the retail version.
