The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Plug and Play detection for non-Display Data Channel (DDC) monitors is not
supported in Microsoft Windows. You must manually install the monitor by
selecting the appropriate driver from a list of those available in Windows 95.
If a driver for your particular monitor is not listed, contact the monitor's
manufacturer for the necessary drivers.

CAUSE
=====

DDC is the Plug and Play standard for monitors. DDC monitors are designed to
meet the Video Electronic Standards Association (VESA) standard that defines the
DDC implementation. Windows automatically detects and enumerates a DDC monitor
if it is connected to a display adapter that has also been designed to the DDC
standard. Windows also installs the correct Setup information (.inf) file
necessary for the display driver to set the proper refresh rate.

If the monitor is incorrectly detected as a VESA Plug and Play Monitor, it may
not be listed in any of the existing .inf files. If this is the case, use the
disk provided by the monitor manufacturer to install the appropriate .inf file.
If the monitor manufacturer did not provide a disk, contact the manufacturer to
obtain the correct .inf file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, enable the automatic detection of your Plug and Play
monitor:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Display.

2. On the Settings tab, click Advanced.

3. On the Monitor tab, click to select the "Automatically detect Plug & Play
   monitors" check box.

4. Click OK, and then click OK.
