 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If a BROWSE FORMAT command uses a format file that contains a syntax error, the
resulting Browse window is blank. Visual FoxPro produces no error message.
Earlier versions of FoxPro produce the following error message:

   No fields to process

And no Browse window appears.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step to Reproduce Behavior
--------------------------

1. Use the Customer.dbf file located in the Visual FoxPro \Samples\Data folder.

2. Create a format file by typing "MODIFY COMMAND Test.fmt" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Command window. Add the following line of code to the
   file:

         @ SAY 24,24,  company+contact

   This line of code is incorrect intentionally.

3. Type the following lines in the Command window, pressing the Enter key after
   each line:

   " SET FORMAT TO Test.fmt
   BROWSE FORMAT " (without the quotation marks)

4. A blank Browse window appears.
