There are five different game-play commentaries available in Golf 3.0; Classic,
Default, Attitude, Tournament, and Comedy. The following is a description of
each commentary type:

 - Classic: This commentary features the sounds from Microsoft Golf versions 1.0
   and 2.0.

 - Default: This standard commentary closely resembles the Classic sounds but is
   a little more traditional.

 - Attitude: This dialog consists of amusing catch phrases, wisecracks, and
   snappy retorts.

 - Tournament: This narration has a whispering announcer who critiques every
   shot, while the gallery reacts in the background.

 - Comedy: For this commentary, put your ego aside as a comedic announcer tees
   off on your game.
