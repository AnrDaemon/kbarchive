SYMPTOMS
========

When the Document Map view is the active view, the Activewindow.Panes.Count
command returns 1 instead of 2 as expected.

CAUSE
=====

The Document Map view consists of two elements: a document pane and a document
navigation pane. By design, Word considers Document Map view to be a single
pane; therefore, the pane count returned is 1.

WORKAROUND

To workaround this problem you can use the following example Visual Basic for
Applications routine. This routine uses the DocumentMap property to determine if
Document Map view is turned on. If it is, then the macro sets the variable,
numPanes, equal to 2.

      Sub IsDocMapOn()
         If ActiveWindow.DocumentMap = True Then
            numPanes = 2
         End If
      End Sub
