TITLE   :"Stop 0x1E" Message Reinstalling Windows NT with SP3 and RAS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you reinstall Windows NT 4.0 over an existing Windows NT 4.0 installation
with Remote Access Service (RAS), or when you install RAS for the first time,
you may experience either of the following symptoms:

 - Your computer reboots repeatedly.

 - You receive the following error message:

   STOP: 0x0000001E (0xC0000005, 0xFF1BBD79, 0x00000000, 0x00000038)
   KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED Address ff1bbd79 has base at ff1ae000 - tcpip.sys

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3 is
installed. The Tcpip.sys file that is installed by the service pack is not
replaced with the original Tcpip.sys file from the Windows NT 4.0 CD- ROM when
you reinstall Windows NT or install RAS for the first time.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following methods to resolve this issue:

 - If you have not logged into your computer, choose the Last Known Good option
   at boot. Then remove RAS, reinstall RAS, and reapply the latest Service Pack.
   Perform all of these steps without rebooting.

   -or-

 - Replace the Tcpip.sys file installed by the service pack with the original
   version of the file included on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM. To do so, use one
   of the following methods, and then reinstall the latest version of the
   service pack.

   Method 1
   --------

   If you have access to another computer with Windows NT 4.0 without Windows NT
   4.0 Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3 installed, copy the Tcpip.sys file from
   the %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers folder on the other computer to the
   corresponding folder on your computer, and then restart your computer.

   NOTE: To use this method, Windows NT must be installed on a FAT partition and
   you must be able to access your hard disk using MS-DOS, Windows 95, or a boot
   disk.

   Method 2
   --------

   If you can dual-boot Windows NT and Windows 95 on your computer, follow these
   steps:

   1. Start Windows 95.

   2. From a command prompt in Windows 95, expand the Tcpip.sys file from the
      I386 folder on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the
      %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers folder of your original Windows NT
      installation. For example, type the following command:

      expand tcpip.sy_ %systemroot%\system32\drivers\tcpip.sys

      NOTE: To properly expand files from the Windows NT CD-ROM, you must use the
      Expand.exe utility included with Windows NT. The Windows NT Expand.exe
      utility can only be run from a command prompt in a 32-bit environment such
      as Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT.

   3. Restart your computer and start Windows NT.

   NOTE: To use this method, Windows NT must be installed on a FAT partition.

   Method 3
   --------

   1. Install Windows NT to a different folder on your hard drive.

   2. Copy the Tcpip.sys file from the %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers folder in
      the new Windows NT installation to the corresponding folder in the
      original installation.

   3. Restart your computer to the original Windows NT installation.

   4. Remove the temporary Windows NT installation, and then delete any entries
      in the Boot.ini file that are entered for that installation.
