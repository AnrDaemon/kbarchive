TITLE   :XCLN: 16-Bit Exchange Client Memory Issue
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears when you start a 16-bit Exchange Client:

   The MAPI spooler could not be started. Close and restart all mail-
   enabled applications. MAPI 1.0[000004c7]

In most cases, this is a conventional memory issue.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following:

 - Optimize conventional memory as much as possible (for example, by means of
   MEMMAKER from MS-DOS 6.0/6.2).

 - Disable all real mode device drivers and TSR programs you do not need.

 - Disable automatically started applications by WIN.INI via RUN=, LOAD=).

 - Use Program Manager (Progman.exe) as your shell.

 - Change the order in which your programs or drivers load to minimize memory
   fragmentation.

 - Remove as many third-party Windows drivers or virtual device drivers (VxDs)
   as possible.

 - Using Windows for Workgroups, uncheck the option "Use Network DDE" in control
   panel app network.

 - Configure the computer using NetBEUI or TCP/IP if possible.

 - Test a Win16 computer by means of the Memvalet utility (this forces DLLs to
   load into upper memory). The utility is unsupported and should only be used
   after the normal troubleshooting steps have failed.
