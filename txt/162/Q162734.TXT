TITLE   :OL97: Cannot Access Offline Folders When Working Offline
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook 97 while
working offline, your offline folders are not available.

CAUSE
=====

You did not log on to Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Log on to Windows 95. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Shut Down.

2. Click to select "Close all programs and log on as a different user?"

3. Click Yes.

When the Logon dialog box appears, enter your Windows password. You should now be
able to open your offline folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you start Windows 95 while connected to your network, you receive the
network password dialog box and log on as you normally do. If your network
password and your Windows password are the same, you receive no prompt for a
Windows password.

When you start Windows 95 while not connected to the network, you can press ESC
(Escape) at the password dialog box and continue without logging on. Although
not connected to your network server to validate your password, you still must
log on to Windows 95 because the Windows password secures the offline store file
(.OST).
