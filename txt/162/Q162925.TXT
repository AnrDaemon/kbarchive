TITLE   :ADT/ODE: Setup Does Not Create Certain Shortcuts
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install an ODE run-time application to a folder that contains parentheses
() in the folder name, any shortcut that points to the installation folder will
not be created.

NOTE: This behavior occurs only with a Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
(ADT), version 7.0 or a Microsoft Office Developer Edition Tools (ODE) run-time
application being installed on Microsoft Windows NT, version 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem with the ACME Setup utility used by the ADT
and the ODE.

RESOLUTION
==========

On Windows NT 3.51, do not use installation folders that contain parentheses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the Setup Wizard.

2. Add the Northwind sample database set as the Application's Main File and a
   custom workgroup file that can be created by copying the system.mdw from the
   Windows\System folder to custom.mdw set as Workgroup File.

3. Create the following three shortcuts with the file to open being the
   Northwind sample database file:

    - One with the run-time option (wizard-provided command line)

    - One with the workgroup option (wizard-provided command line)

    - One with a user specified Command Line with wrkgadm.exe as the executable

4. Click Next to go to the Registry Entries page of the Setup Wizard, and click
   Next again.

5. Make sure that Microsoft Access Run-time Version and Workgroup Administrator
   are selected on the next page, and click Finish to generate the disk images.

6. Run Setup from the disk images folder under the Setup Wizard folder to
   install the run-time application. Change the installation folder to
   c:\sample(sample).

   Note that you receive the following error message for the run-time shortcut
   and the wrkgrp shortcut:

   Setup was unable to create an item in the Program Manager group
   '<application name>', item: ' "<shortcut
   name>",,0,0,0,"C:\sample(sample)",0,0,0'

However, the Workgroup Administrator shortcut is created and Setup is completed
"successfully."
