======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select a file by double-clicking "theApp" in the Globals list in
ClassView, the WizardBar in the editor is not available. The WizardBar remains
disabled even if the Workspace window is switched to FileView.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step to Reproduce Behavior
--------------------------

1. Load an application generated by the Microsoft Foundation Class AppWizard.

2. On the Globals list in the ClassView, double-click theApp. This brings up the
   application's main .cpp file.

3. Notice there is no WizardBar for the file. Switch to FileView. Again, there
   is no WizardBar.

4. Bring up the shortcut menu in the file editor. The toolbar, that is the
   WizardBar, is grayed out and cannot be enabled.

5. Close the file and then re-open the file from FileView. Now the WizardBar is
   visible, and it can be enabled or disabled by clicking "toolbar" in the
   file's shortcut menu.

6. Switch back to ClassView. If you click functions defined in the .cpp file
   such as InitInstance, the WizardBar is available.
