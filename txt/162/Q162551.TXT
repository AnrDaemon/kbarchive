   command:

         DO HOME()+'BROWSER.APP' WITH HOME()+'SAMPLES\CLASSES\SAMPLES'

2. Open the "datachecker" class by clicking on it with the mouse.

3. Right-click any of the classes in the left pane of the Class Browser window,
   or right-click any of the methods that show up on the right pane of the Class
   Browser window.

   NOTE: This displays a context menu where the first choice is "Descriptions."

4. Leaving the Context menu open, click Close in the Class Browser on the top
   right corner of the window.

   NOTE: A Class Browser dialog box appears with an error that begins with
   "TOBROWSER is not an object."

   Class Browser. Either choice closes the Class Browser.
