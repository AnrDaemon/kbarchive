TITLE   :SMS Administrator Misinterprets Multiple Site Selections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbSCMan smssetup smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible to use the CTRL key and the mouse to select multiple non-
sequential secondary sites for deletion in the Systems Management Server
Administrator program UI. After you select the sites and press the DELETE key,
Systems Management Server will present a confirmation box that asks "Are you
sure you want to delete the selected item(s)?" but does not list the sites that
are going to be deleted.

Upon confirming the deletion, the Systems Management Server Administrator program
UI begins the deletion of all sites listed between the first and last item
selected, whether or not they were highlighted.

For example, if you have six secondary sites, and select sites 1, 3, and 5 for
deletion, Systems Management Server will remove sites 1 through 5, including
sites 2 and 4.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
