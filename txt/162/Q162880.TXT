TITLE   :XADM: Event ID-1305 Jet_errObjectNotFound
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4 exc5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Edbutil utility with the /d and /r switches to repair a corrupted
EDB file, the following error message may be generated by the Edbutil.exe
application:

   -1305 Jet_errObjectNotFound

CAUSE
=====

This error message may be generated if you run the Edbutil utility with the /d
and /r options. During the repair process one or more data tables is discarded
due to corruption. To verify that this is the case, check the application event
log for the following event ID:

   Event ID: 44
   Source: EDB
   Type: Warning

   Description: The database engine lost one table called <datatablename>

This error message means that the Edbutil utility discarded this particular table
during the repair process. If this table is one of the required tables, such as
the Deleted Messages, Mailbox, or Folder Tombstone tables, the store may not
start and the "-1305 Jet_errObjectNotFound" error message may be generated.

WORKAROUND
==========

Because "-1305 Jet_errObjectNotFound" is an unrecoverable error message, you
must restore from a valid backup to recover.
