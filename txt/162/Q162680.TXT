TITLE   :XCON: SMTP Messages Contain Encapsulated X.400 Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After upgrading the Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 to Service Pack 3, messages
sent to multiple SMTP recipients contain X.400 addresses instead of the normal
SMTP address.

The following is an example of how the address may look:

   IMCEAX400-
   c=US+3Ba=+20+3Bp=Microsoft+3Bo=Site+3Bdda+3ASMTP=user+3B@microsoft.com

The following is how the address would normally appear:

   User@microsoft.com

Users trying to reply to the X.400 addresses user will receive an undeliverable
NDR from their mail host.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
