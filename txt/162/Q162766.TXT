DOCUMENT:Q162766  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :WINS Records Are Timestamped Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a WINS extinct (also called tombstone) record is replicated, the record's
Expiration Date is set incorrectly on the replication pull partner.

CAUSE
=====

WINS is making no distinction between active and tombstone replicas and is
adding verify interval (which could be up to 576 hours) to the current time for
tombstones, instead of Extinction Timeout.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
