TITLE   :Err Msg: RAS Error 633: The Port Is in Use or Not Configured
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to dial out using the Remote Access Service (RAS), you may
receive the following error message:

   RAS Error 633: The port is in use or not configured for Remote Access
   Dial-Out.

Stopping and restarting the Remote Access Service temporarily resolves the
problem.

CAUSE
=====

If Rasdial.exe terminates prematurely, it can leave the port in an indeterminate
state. The port disappears from Remote Access Server Manager if it is configured
for dial-in.

This problem is not specific to Rasdial.exe. Any program that terminates
prematurely without clearing the port state may cause the same problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the latest Service Pack for Windows NT version 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information about obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
