KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open an Event Viewer file (.evt file) through the Server Tools,
Event Viewer installed on a Windows 95 computer, the following error is
returned:

   The remote procedure call failed.

CAUSE
=====

Copy the Event Viewer file from a Windows NT computer locally to the Windows 95
computer where the Server Tools are installed. Then try to open the file through
Event Viewer that comes with the Server Tools. Event Viewer will try to connect
to the Windows NT computer from where the Event Viewer file was copied. If you
do not have the rights to access that Windows NT computer or if the Windows NT
computer is not on your network, you will receive the error: The remote
procedure call failed.

The Event Viewer files are located under %system root%\system32\config on a
Windows NT computer. The file names are: AppEvent.evt, SecEvent.evt, and
SysEvent.evt.

WORKAROUND
==========

When viewing an Event Viewer file this way, make sure you can connect to the
Windows NT computer from where the file was copied.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
