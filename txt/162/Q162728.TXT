SYMPTOMS

When using the Systems Management Server Administrator program to open a chat
session with a Systems Management Server client, the client can chat with the
system that initiates the session. However, when the server attempts to chat
back, the text typed is not visible to the client.

This is an intermittent problem that does not occur on every remote chat session.

version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
