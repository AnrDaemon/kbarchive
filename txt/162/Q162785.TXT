PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0; NT:; WINDOWS:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK), on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If run from Microsoft Network Client 3.0, the RPC client sample file Helloc.exe
fails with the following or a similar message:

   RpcStringBindingCompose returned 0x0
   pszStringBinding = ncacn_np:rxobot_serv[\\pipe\\hello]
   RpcBindingFromStringBinding returned 0x0
   Rpc Binding Handle = 3e5a0016
   Calling the remote procedure 'HelloProc'
   Print the string 'hello, world' on the server
   Runtime reported exception 0x1b = 27
   RpcStringFree returned 0x0
   RpcBindingFree returned 0x0

CAUSE
=====

Either the Network Client is running the Basic Redirector, or the logged on user
cannot connect to the IPC$ directory on the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do either of the following:

 - Run SETUP on the client and configure it to run the Full Redirector.

-or-

 - Make sure that the user who is logged on at the client can perform the
   following operation:

   NET USE \\<server>\IPC$

   NOTE: It is not necessary to make an IPC$ connection before running
   Helloc.exe, but Helloc.exe will fail if either the client or the user is not
   capable of making an IPC$ connection.
