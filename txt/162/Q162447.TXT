TITLE   :Multiple Print Jobs When Printing Single Document
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document from a Windows 95 workstation to a printer shared on a
Windows NT-based computer, multiple print jobs may appear in the printer's queue
for the document. When this occurs, one print job displays a valid file size and
all others display a size of zero bytes. If separator pages are specified for
the printer, each print job has a separator page. Each separator page has a job
number and description of "Remote Downlevel Document."

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if anti-virus software is running on your Windows 95
workstation.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, one of the following methods:

 - Configure the anti-virus software not to scan your document files by
   specifying not to scan file types with extensions such as .doc and .txt.

 - Disable or remove the anti-virus software on the Windows 95 workstation.

 - Contact the anti-virus software manufacturer for updates to the program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For information about how to configure your anti-virus software, consult the
program's documentation or manufacturer.
