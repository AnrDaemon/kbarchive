 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Internet Mail information service for Microsoft Exchange
(Windows Messaging), the Internet tab may be either missing or duplicated in the
properties for a received Internet message.

CAUSE
=====

A registry entry is duplicated or missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

Check the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Clients\Extensions

One of the two following keys should exist:

   Internet Mail with a String value of "4.0;minet32.dll;2;;;IMAIL"
   InternetMail with a String value of "4.0;minet32.dll;2;;;;IMAIL"

If neither entry exists, add one. In Windows NT, the value should be type REG_SZ
instead of String.

If duplicate entries exist, remove one of them.
