TITLE   :DOC: DECLARE DLL Example Has Incorrect Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00 3.00b 5.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The DECLARE - DLL example in Visual FoxPro Help gives the following information
about the GetActiveWindow API call:

   This example for Windows displays the window handle for the currently active
   Windows application. When the WAIT window is displayed, you have 5 seconds to
   press ALT+TAB to switch to a different Windows application, or you can leave
   Visual FoxPro as the active application.

This gives the impression that the GetActiveWindow API will return a handle for
the currently active window. This is wrong. The GetActiveWindow returns only a
handle to the Active Window of the calling thread.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Win32 API Reference and the Win32API Help file for the GetActiveWindow has
the following:

   The GetActiveWindow function retrieves the window handle of the active window
   associated with the thread that calls the function.

   HWND GetActiveWindow(VOID)

   Parameters

   This function has no parameters.

   Return Values

   If the function succeeds, the return value is the handle of the active window
   associated with the thread that calls the function. If the calling thread
   does not have an active window, the return value is NULL.
