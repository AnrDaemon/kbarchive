TITLE   :Access Violation in SPOOLSS when Printing to a Serial Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a serial port configuration string greater than 20 characters is specified
and that serial port is used by an active printer, Localmon.dll generates an
access violation in Spoolss.exe.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can only occur if the following Registry Key is directly edited
using a Registry Editor:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\ 
CurrentVersion\Ports\COMx

If a serial port configuration string greater that 20 characters is entered into
this value it will cause Localmon.dll to generate an access violation.

These keys are normally directly configured using Ports in Control Panel. If this
application is used, it is not possible to specify a port configuration greater
than 20 characters. However, it may be necessary to specify a custom port
configuration for some serial handshaking options, which can require a string
longer than 20 characters.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
