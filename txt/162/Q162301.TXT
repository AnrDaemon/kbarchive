PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbvfp kbvfp500aFIXkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After issuing an @ SAY command that follows a SET DEVICE to PRINTER command, the
following error occurs:

   Memory is low, so streaming output updating has been disabled.

Subsequent operations in Windows 95 may become sluggish due to a possible loss of
memory resources.

STATUS
======

This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, enter the following two lines:

       SET DEVICE to PRINT   && press the <Enter> key at the end
       @1,2 SAY ''           && of each of these lines.

   NOTE: The following message appears in a pop-up dialog box: "Memory is low, so
   streaming output updating has been disabled."

2. Click OK to remove the message box.

3. In the Command window, enter the following line:

       @3,2 SAY "Print out this test line"

NOTE: When issuing the @...SAY command, ensure the Windows 95 desktop is visible.
Observe the second @ SAY command or any other subsequent @...SAY command causes
the desktop icons to flash.

NOTE: A workaround to this problem is to SET PRINTER ON, SET DEVICE TO PRINT and
issue the print statement using the question marks ("?"). A SET PRINTER OFF and
SET PRINTER TO command should be issued once the print statements are completed.
