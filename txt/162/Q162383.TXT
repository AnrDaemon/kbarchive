TITLE   :Site Configuration Manager Stops When Enumerating User Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup kbSCMan smssetup smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If changes to a Systems Management Server site's properties do not go current,
even after 24 hours, the Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager
(SCMAN) may have stopped responding. In the Scman.log file, the last entry will
be "<Domain name> user groups will be enumerated." No more entries will
have been logged since that time. SCMAN reports no errors during this time, and
its status will be "started" in the Services Control Panel. There may be .ct1
files backed up in the Sitecfg.box directory.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server Site Configuration Manager will stop responding
during Global User Group enumeration if it cannot contact the primary domain
controller (PDC) of the domain listed. If this occurs, no site changes made can
be processed. Note that this interferes with neither job nor inventory
processing.

WORKAROUND
==========

Stopping and restarting SCMan will alleviate the issue immediately, but a
longer-term workaround is to use the SETGUG utility to disable Global User Group
enumeration, either on a permanent basis, or by setting it to a longer interval.
Setgug.exe is in the BackOffice Resource Kit. It is also in the Support
directory of the Systems Management Server 1.1 compact disc.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
