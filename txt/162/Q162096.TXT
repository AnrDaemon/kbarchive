TITLE   :Drivers Fail to Load When I/O Address Is Above 0xFFF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a driver is configured to use an input/output (I/O) base address greater
than 0xFFF, the driver may fail to load when the system has a moon PCI-PCI
bridge chipset.

CAUSE
=====

The moon bridge has a read-only version of the I/O base and limit registers.
Intel states that this means the bridge should get I/O ports ranging from 0 -
0xFFFF. Windows NT version 4.0 expects the I/O base range to be from 0 - 0xFFF.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
