TITLE   :Problem with DHCP Decline Feature in Service Pack 2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP2 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 DHCP client may fail to obtain a DHCP lease if a
duplicate IP address exists on the network. DHCP logs an error in the event log
with event ID 1008.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Service Pack 2 includes an update to the DHCP client that improves
the ability of a workstation to handle duplicate IP addresses. Upon receiving a
DHCP lease, it ARPs for the IP address that was assigned. If a response is
received (indicating that the address is already in use by another device on the
network) it issues a DHCP decline to the server. The server then marks the
address as "bad" and does not attempt to assign that IP address to any device.
The client re-issues a DHCP DISCOVER packet and starts the lease process over
again.

For more information on this, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q161430
   TITLE : DHCP: Detecting and Flagging Duplicate IP Addresses

DHCP clients that also have RAS installed on them do not perform this DHCP
decline operation successfully.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new version of Rasarp.sys is available that corrects this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 Service
Pack 2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
