TITLE   :"-B" Is Printed at End of TN3270 Print Job
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A hyphen and the letter B (-B) are printed at the end of a TN3270 print job.

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 Server is sending down a WCC byte to the emulator (with the unlock
keyboard byte enabled). This would be appropriate for a display session in order
to give the emulator direction to send more data back to the host. However,
because this is a printer session, the emulator instead interprets this byte as
data and prints it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix referenced below. A fix was made to the TN3270 Server to not send
this byte sequence over printer sessions at the end of the print job.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11 and
2.11 Service Pack 1.


A supported fix is now available for SNA Server 2.11 SP1, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
