SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Winnt32.exe program to install or upgrade to Windows NT version
4.0, you can use multiple distribution servers as sources to copy files from.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some cases, you may want to specify multiple source servers for the program
to copy files from when you are installing or upgrading to Windows NT 4.0. You
can use up to ten different distribution servers at the same time. Using
multiple distribution servers may decrease the amount of time required to copy
the distribution files, because multiple sources can contribute. You can also
specify a local path as a source path.

If a connection cannot be established at the start of the file copy, the source
will not be considered for the operation. To begin the file copy operation, you
must have at least one available distribution source. However, if a source
becomes unavailable during the file copy, errors may occur.

The following command shows how to pull distribution files from three other
servers and the local CD-ROM drive (for a total of four sources):

WINNT32 /B /S:\\Srv1\i386 /S:\\Srv2\I386 /S:\\Srv3\I386 /S:F:\i386
