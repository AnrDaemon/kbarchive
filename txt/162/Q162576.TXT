TITLE   :FPNW Clients Do Not Receive Printing Notification
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A NetWare-compatible client receives no notification that its print job has
printed, even though the /NOTIFY option has been specified with the CAPTURE
utility. Print job notification may be sent to a Microsoft- compatible client of
the same name that is attached to the Windows NT Server.

CAUSE
=====

The printer defined on the File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) server is
not configured through FPNW's print server option or else is a locally attached
printer. FPNW will only notify users of printed jobs if the printer is defined
as a NetWare-compatible print server.

WORKAROUND
==========

Configure the printer to operate as a NetWare-compatible print server, if
possible. For more information on configuring FPNW print servers, see the FPNW
Administrator's Guide.
