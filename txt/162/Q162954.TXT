SYMPTOMS
========

If you apply formatting to a blank table cell, save the document as HTML, and
then reopen the file, the blank cell formatting will be lost in the conversion
process to and from HTML.

CAUSE
=====

Formatting for blank table cells is lost when you save the file in HTML format.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, put a nonbreaking space(CTRL+SHIFT+SPACEBAR) in the
empty table cell. (A standard space or tab in the empty cell will not preserve
the formatting.)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
