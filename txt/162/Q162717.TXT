TITLE   :Autodial Settings Lost When Using Roaming Profiles
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Internet Explorer or Microsoft Internet Mail and News,
the Remote Access Service (RAS) automatic dialing feature does not function.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using a roaming profile and a user without
automatic dialing in their profile logs into Windows NT after your session. The
next time you log into Windows NT without rebooting the computer, automatic
dialing fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only workaround at this time is to restart the computer between access by
different users.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
