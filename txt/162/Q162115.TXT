PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS: 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run a Setup.exe created by the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Setup
Wizard, the following error occurs:

   Setup error 280 Object <n>
   Your Setup files may be damaged.
   Try restarting the Setup program.

CAUSE
=====

The error is due to a file with a long file name that is large enough to require
splitting. This may occur on a file size of 725 K or larger. However, smaller
files may also cause problems.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can rename the file to a conventional 8 character name or obtain an updated
Setup Wizard.

There is an updated version of the Setup Wizard that corrects this problem.

To obtain the updated version of the Setup Wizard, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q162004 PATCH: Setwiz5.exe the Updated VFP 5.0 for Windows Setup Wizard

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Place a 1 MB file with a long file name in a distribution directory.

2. Run the Setup Wizard against that directory, and select none of the check
   boxes in Step 2. Select the Netsetup option.

3. Go to the Netsetup directory and run Setup.exe. The error may occur
   immediately or later in the Setup process.
