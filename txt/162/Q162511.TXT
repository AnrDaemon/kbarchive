DOCUMENT:Q162511  13-JUN-2001  [sna]
TITLE   :Calling CMSPTR over Thunking DLLs Causes Access Violation
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a 16-bit CPI-C application calls uses the
Set_Prepare_To_Receive_Type(cmsptr) application programming interface (API)
while running over the 16-bit-to-32-bit CPIC thunking interface, the application
terminates abnormally with an application error.

CAUSE
=====

The CPIC thunking interface was not handling this call correctly. In the
thunking code, The Set_Prepare_To_Receive_Type(cmsptr) function is defined as:

   CallProcEx32W(4,0xF,(DWORD)lpfn32, (DWORD)pConvID,<BR/>
   (DWORD)pPTRType, (DWORD)pRetCode);

The function should be:

   CallProcEx32W(3,0xF,(DWORD)lpfn32, (DWORD)pConvID,<BR/>
   (DWORD)pPTRType, (DWORD)pRetCode);<

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix referenced below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 2.11, 2.11 Service
Pack 1 (SP1).


A supported fix is now available for 2.11 SP1, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
