SYMPTOMS
========

When you display the Macros dialog box, you have the option to list available
macros from different sources in the "Macros in" box. One of the options to
choose is "All Active Templates and Documents." When you select this option, you
may not see the macros you expect.

CAUSE
=====

The "All Active Templates and Documents" option lists macros available in:

 - Templates or documents placed in the Office Start Up folder.

 - Templates or documents made available when you click "Templates and Add- Ins"
   on the Tools menu.

 - The currently active document and its attached template.

The "All Active Templates and Documents" option does NOT show:

 - Macros in non-active but currently open documents or templates

 - New, Open, or Close events for any document.

 - Visual Basic for Applications code placed in UserForm event procedures and
   subroutines or functions.

 - Subroutines or functions that expect arguments, as in the following
   examples:

         Sub MySub (MyString As String)

   -and-

         Function MyFunction (MyString As String)

 - Subroutines or Functions declared as Private, as in the following examples:

         Private Sub MySub ()

   -and-

   Private Function MyFunction ()

WORKAROUND
==========

Activate the document or template containing the macros you want to see before
you display the Macros dialog box.
