TITLE   :NTFS and DISK Synchronous Request Never Completes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When NTFS and DISK use a synchronous request to perform an I/O control within a
page fault, it never completes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs as a result of the NTFS dismount code. NTFS is doing a
IOCTL_DISK_IS_WRITABLE I/O control within a page fault. Both NTFS and DISK are
doing this, using a synchronous request which never completes because APC are
disabled to do the page fault. This problem may affect removable media
dismounts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.
