TITLE   :RRAS Stops Routing After Encountering Zero Checksum
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Your Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) Server may stop routing network
between segments and you may receive some event log messages regarding checksum
errors from neighbors.

CAUSE
=====

One of your neighboring routers has sent a packet containing something other
than ffff. When the checksum of a packet equals zero, which is illegal, RRAS
expects to receive ffff.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Routing and Remote Access Update
for Windows NT Server version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the Routing
& Remote Access Service Hotfix Update. You can obtain this update from
Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet at the following location:
