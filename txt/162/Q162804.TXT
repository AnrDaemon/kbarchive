TITLE   :STOP 0x00000079 After Applying Windows NT 4.0 Post-SP2 KRNL Fix
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a multiprocessor system, after you apply the Windows NT 4.0 Post-SP2 (Service
Pack 2) KRNL-FIX (Krnl40x.exe, where x is the processor type) the system will
display a STOP error message:

   STOP: 0x00000079 (0x00000002 0x00000002 0x00000000 0x00000000)

CAUSE
=====

This error is a mismatched HAL STOP error message. It is caused by applying the
single processor Ntoskrnl.exe, rather than using the Ntkrnlmp.exe file, which
needs to be renamed to Ntoskrnl.exe before the fix is applied.

The README file from the fix includes this information:

   Note: If the target computer is a multiprocessor system, then perform the
   following command in order to replace the uniprocessor version of the kernel
   with the multiprocessor version. This step must not be done if the target
   computer is a uniprocessor system.

   Copy NTKRNLMP.EXE NTOSKRNL.EXE

   To install this hotfix, put the new Ntoskrnl.exe, hotfix.exe, and hotfix.ini
   in the same (temporary) directory, and then type:

   "hotfix /install" (without the quotation marks)

   After installation, type "hotfix" (without the quotation marks) to verify that
   it was installed correctly, then perform a reboot the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

 - If Windows NT is installed on a FAT partition, replace Ntoskrnl.exe in the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 directory with the Ntkrnlmp.exe from the Post-SP2
   KRNL-FIX. In the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory, rename Ntkrnlmp.exe to
   Ntoskrnl.exe.

   Reboot the computer and restart Windows NT.



-OR-

 - Use the following KB article to modify your ERD diskette to replace the
   Single processor kernel with the Muliprocessor kernel.

   TITLED : Replacing System Files Using a Modified Emergency Repair Disk

-OR-

 - If Windows NT is installed on an NTFS partition, re-install Windows NT to a
   separate directory (parallel installation). Boot into this new installation.
   Go to the original Windows NT %SystemRoot%\System32 directory and replace
   Ntoskrnl.exe with the Ntkrnlmp.exe from the Post- SP2 KRNL-FIX. In the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 directory, rename Ntkrnlmp.exe to Ntoskrnl.exe.

   Reboot the computer and restart Windows NT, starting into the original version
   of Windows NT. If the original version now starts properly, the "parallel
   installation" can be deleted. This can be done using Explorer, File Manager
   or My Computer.

   WARNING: Use caution when deleting operating system subdirectories or
   modifying the Boot.ini.

   Delete ONLY the Windows NT directory that was created for the parallel
   installation; do NOT delete the original installation.

   In addition, the Boot.ini can be modified to remove references to this now
   non-existent version of Windows NT. If the parallel installation was
   installed to a directory called Winnt.bak, delete only those lines in
   Boot.ini that have Winnt.bak. Also, make sure that the "DEFAULT=" entry is
   directed back to the ARC path and directory for the original installation of
   Windows NT.

   For additional information on the Boot.ini file, please see the following
