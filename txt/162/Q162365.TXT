-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A print job is stuck in the printer queue of the Windows NT print server and
cannot be deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the print job, follow these steps. On the print server:

1. Close Print Manager in Windows NT 3.5x. Close the Printers Folder in Windows
   NT 4.0.

2. In Control Panel, double-click the Services icon, click the Spooler Service,
   and then click Stop. If you are using TCP/IP Printing Services, click it and
   then click Stop.

3. Delete the *.spl and *.shd files that show the approximate time and date of
   the print job causing the problem. They are in the
   %Winroot%\System32\Spool\Printers directory.

   NOTE: In some cases, Windows NT may not allow the *.spl file(s) to be deleted
   or renamed. Renaming the *.shd file and restarting the spooler service may be
   enough to clear the problem.

4. Restart the services stopped in step 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With corrupt or too many .spl and .shd files, a Dr. Watson or Application Error
in Spools may also occur.
