TITLE   :System Files on Floppy Disk May Have Incorrect Date and Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Format command in either Windows Explorer or My Computer to
create a bootable floppy disk, the date and time stamp of all system files on
the floppy disk reflects the date the disk was formatted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, format the disk by typing

   " format a: /s " (without the quotation marks)

from a command prompt. If the disk is already formatted and you want to transfer
the system files (make the disk bootable), type:

   " sys a: " (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the system files are created using Windows Explorer or My Computer, some
anti-virus programs may generate a checksum warning when these files are
encountered.

If you use a floppy disk with the incorrect date and time stamps to make the hard
disk bootable, the incorrect date and time stamps are reflected on the system
files copied to the hard disk.
