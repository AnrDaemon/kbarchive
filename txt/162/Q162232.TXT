KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to check out a file from a Visual SourceSafe (VSS) enabled web,
you receive the following error message:

   Server error: Visual Source Safe Failure.
   Verify that you have write access to the Visual Source Safe repository.
   A "You do not have access rights to $/<webproject name>" error occurred
   while operating on file "$/<webproject name>/<filename>"

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs in the following situations:

Case 1: You have write permission to the file that you are attempting to check
out.

When you checkout a file from a VSS enabled web using FrontPage Explorer, you are
granted write permission to the file. If you already have write permission to
the file, FrontPage assumes you have made modifications to the file and that you
do not want to overwrite these changes. You receive the error message when you
attempt to check out the file.

Case 2: You do not have read/write permission on the VSS database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Case 1: To prevent this error, set the proper permissions on all the files in
the web and recalculate the links. In FrontPage Explorer, click Recalculate
Hyperlinks on the Tools menu.

Case 2: Confirm that your user account is set up with read/write permissions in
the Visual SourceSafe Administrator. If the Visual SourceSafe database is stored
on an NTFS partition, verify that the user account is set to file access
permissions.
