TITLE   :RIP Table Sent While Shutting Down When Silent RIP Set
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Routing Information Protocol (RIP) table information may be sent when you shut
down a computer, even though Silent RIP is enabled in the registry.

CAUSE
=====

Normally when we send RIP packets, we first check to see if the SilentRip value
in the registry is set. In the case where the computer is shut down, we did not
check this value.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To disable RIP broadcasts you can set up the SilentRip registry entry.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ 
   IpRip\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

      Value Name: SilentRip
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      Value:      1 or 0

   NOTE: Setting this to 1 lets the server accept RIP but not send RIP packets.
   Setting this to 0 causes the server to also send RIP packets.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
