TITLE   :DNS with "WINS Reverse Lookup" Fails with Multiple IP Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use NSLOOKUP to perform reverse lookup using a Windows NT 4.0 Domain
Name Service (DNS) server that has a network adapter with multiple IP addresses
(and has a zone that has "Use WINS Resolution" enabled) you receive the
following error:

   [dns server] can't find IP address: Non-existent domain

CAUSE
=====

By design NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) supports only one IP address per network
interface card (NIC) adapter. It is possible to configure TCP/IP to have
multiple IP addresses on a single NIC, but NetBT will only support the first
address configured. For more information, please see the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:
