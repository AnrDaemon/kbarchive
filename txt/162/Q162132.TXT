SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the following line of Visual Basic for Applications code

      ActiveDocument.SaveAs "My HTML Document.html", _

   Run-time error '5880': No registered converter supports saving files in this
   format.

FileConverters collection using a string value instead of a numerical value for
