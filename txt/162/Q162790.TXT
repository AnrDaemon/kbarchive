TITLE   :Auto Arrange Activates Itself in Copied User Profiles
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When copying a profile from a reference account to Default User, the Auto
Arrange attribute activates for all users using that copied profile.

For example:

Create a reference account that contains all the desktop properties wanted for
new users. Ensure that Auto Arrange is not selected and some icons are placed in
the center of the screen. Log off and then log on as administrator. In Control
Panel, double-click the System icon. Click the User Profiles tab and select the
profile for the reference account. Click Copy To and select
%SystemRoot%\Profiles\Default User.

Create a new user account and log on as that user. You will find that the new
user has all the desktop properties needed; however, any icons that had been
placed in certain locations in the original profile are now all arranged on the
left side of the screen. The Auto Arrange property has automatically been
applied whether it was manually selected or not.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
