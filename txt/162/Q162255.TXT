The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you load Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 6.0, you may receive the
following error message

   Invalid Page Fault in G3d.dll.

You may also receive this error message when you attempt to load third party
scenery.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, turn off the Dynamic scenery as follows:

1. On the World menu, click Dynamic Scenery.

2. Clear all the check boxes.

3. Set the Scenery Frequency to Very Sparse, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

G3d.dll is the three-dimensional portion of the graphics engine used in Flight
Simulator version 6.0. It contains the BGL interpreter for Flight Simulator.

Exceeding array boundaries or accessing memory outside of allocated buffers are
typical causes of invalid page faults. Scenery created for previous versions of
Flight Simulator may not handle memory access or variables in the code the same
as scenery designed for the Windows version. The most common occurrence of this
happens in the Dynamic Scenery. Turning it off has been the most effective means
of preventing this error message from occurring.

In some cases, Hardware acceleration has also been an issue. Turning down the
acceleration may help. Some accelerator cards come equipped with their own
control panel. This control panel may contain settings that affect device or
item caching, and acceleration. Turning off these caching items has prevented
similar problems. It is recommended that you consult with the video card
manufacturer for more information on these settings.
