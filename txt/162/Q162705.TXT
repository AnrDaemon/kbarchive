TITLE   :Incorrect Colors Printed on HP Laserjet Color 5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you print a document or slide from Word 7.0 or PowerPoint 7.0 to a HP
Laserjet Color 5 printer, the colors on the printout do not match the colors in
Word or PowerPoint.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by text and graphics merging. Rasdd.dll, which deals with
printer languages based on raster (bitmap) images, has an inherent Z ordering
problem.


RESOLUTION
==========

Enabling the "Print Text as Graphics" option will fix this problem. To enable
this option, perform the following steps:

1. In the Printers folder, select the color Laserjet printer.

2. On the File menu, click Document Defaults.

3. Click the Advanced tab then click to select the "Print Text as Graphics"
   option.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows NT 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
