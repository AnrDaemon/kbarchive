TITLE   :FIX: Using SET COLOR TO & Printing a Report Prints Blank Page
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b; WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the SET COLOR OF SCHEME or SET COLOR TO command to change the
foreground color of the desktop to white, any reports that are previewed or sent
to the printer are blank. These commands are still used for backward
compatibility. The _SCREEN.FORECOLOR and _SCREEN.BACKCOLOR commands should be
used instead.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using the following commands instead results in the Report Writer performing
properly:

   " _SCREEN.FORECOLOR=RGB(255,255,255)
   _SCREEN.BACKCOLOR=RGB(0,0,255) " (without the quotation marks)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for
Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SET COLOR OF SCHEME or SET COLOR TO commands are used to set colors in the
FoxPro environment. Issuing one of the following commands changes the foreground
color of FoxPro's desktop to white and the background color to blue:

   SET COLOR TO w+/b
   SET COLOR OF SCHEME 1 to RGB(255, 255, 255, 0, 0, 150)

Issuing the CLEAR command afterward changes the desktop colors. If a FoxPro
report is then previewed or printed, the result is blank pages.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following code into the Command window:

         SET COLOR TO w+/b

2. Create a quick report and preview it. Note that the pages are blank and can
   be paged through depending on the number of records there in the table.
   Sending the report to the printer prints out blank pages.

3. Quit FoxPro and after restarting, type the following code in the Command
   window:

         _SCREEN.FORECOLOR=RGB(255,255,255)
         _SCREEN.BACKCOLOR=RGB(0,0,255)
         CLEAR

4. Now preview or print the report and note that the pages of the report have
   data in them.
