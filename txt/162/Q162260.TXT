SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a subdocument into a master document, you may receive the
following error message:

   The subdocument <path>\<filename> is missing. Do you want to
   expand the master document without this subdocument?

If you click Yes, Word may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

The subdocument you are inserting contains a subdocument that is missing. This
problem occurs if the inserted subdocument contains only the subdocument that is
missing. Word will not hang if the inserted subdocument contains other
subdocuments besides the one that is missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

Correct the problem with the subdocument before you insert it into a master
document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
