TITLE   :Access Violation in Spooler When Using Notepad
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, you may get a SPOOLSS access violation (AV) when
you select Print Setup from within Notepad on a print server.

In the Dr. Watson log or user mode memory dump, you will see that the access
violation occurs in EnumeratePrinters in Spoolss.dll.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur when a printer is attached to LPT1 and is shared on the
network. If you are connecting to the printer through the share instead of the
LPT port, the access violation may occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

On the computer that has the printer installed, print to the local port instead
of to the network share.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
