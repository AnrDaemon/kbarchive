If you install it over the French or German version of MTM
----------------------------------------------------------

 - The graphical areas of the user interface (UI) will remain in the localized
   language.

 - Menus and dialog boxes will be in English, but the yellow buttons will remain
   in the localized language.

 - During game play, pit board overlays will be in English.

 - The English version of DirectX 3.0 is installed, which causes the connection
   types to be in English.

 - The loading dialog box and status text will be in English.

 - The commentary overlay text and audio will remain in the localized language.

If you install it over the Japanese version of MTM

   double-byte character set (DBCS) enabled.
