TITLE   :KiXtart Environment Variables Do Not Exist After Script Runs
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0;Windows:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Environment variables set up through your KiXtart Script do not exist after the
script terminates. When you run the KiXtart logon script on a computer running
Windows 95, the environment variables appear to work properly.

CAUSE
=====

The Set command in Windows 95 is only active during the same MS-DOS session.
When the current session is closed, the variable is no longer in memory.

NOTE: This is different behavior than from a computer running Windows NT Server
version 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To have environment variables for use outside the logon script, use Winset.exe
from the Windows 95 compact disc to set global environment variables.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an excerpt from the KiXtart Documentation:

   Only programs that specifically support this feature (such as ProgMan and
   TaskMan) will have their environment updated. When in doubt about a
   particular program, please ask the supplier of the program whether or not his
   program supports the "WM_WININICHANGE" message for changes to the
   environment.
