TITLE   :Policy Editor Crashes When Using Large Custom ADM Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to save a policy file, Poledit.exe performs an access violation.

CAUSE
=====

A large custom policy template (an ADM file) has been added to enable the
configuration of new (custom) policy entries. Because of the way memory is
allocated for holding the template in memory, corruption of the template occurs,
which makes the policy editor unstable. This corruption results in an access
violation when a policy (.pol) file based on this template is saved to disk.


RESOLUTION
==========

A fixed version of the policy editor is available from Microsoft Technical
Support.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
