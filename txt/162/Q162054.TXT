-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit documentation was not updated properly from
version 3.1, and lists a number of invalid TCP/IP registry parameters. The
parameters listed in this article should be used in their place. The Windows NT
3.5 TCP/IP stack was changed significantly from version 3.1, so many of the old
parameters are no longer valid. The Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit should include
the necessary corrections.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 586 of Appendix B in "Optimizing Windows NT" from the Windows NT Resource
Kit version 3.5 describes the RouterMTU registry parameter. RouterMTU
functionality was replaced in Windows NT 3.5 by PMTU Discovery, as defined in
RFC 1191.

For additional information on the usage of the RouterMTU parameter in Windows NT
3.1, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
