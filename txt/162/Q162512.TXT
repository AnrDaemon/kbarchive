TITLE   :WINSLI Applications Don’t Show User Computer in SNA Admin
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use

 - a 32-bit winsli application

   or

 - a 16-bit WINSLI or WINRUI application against the thunking interface on
   Windows NT,

the User and Computer fields in SNA Server Administrator or Manager for that
session will display incorrectly. They are displayed as follows:

   User        Computer
   ====================
   Unknown     n/a

When using a 32-bit winrui application, the correct User and Computer fields will
be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

The application type was not set correctly for SLI applications. This fix also
includes a small fix to the Wrui3270 (win3x) sample emulator included in the SNA
Server Software Developer Kit (SDK).

RESOLUTION
==========

The application type is now set correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 3.0.


A supported fix is now available for SNA Server versions 2.11 SP1 and 3.0, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack
that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
