SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Ping tool (Ping.exe) to test IP communication to a network
resource, the networked computer or other device may stop responding (hang), or
other errors may occur.

CAUSE
=====

Under some conditions, it is possible for the version of Ping.exe included with
Windows 95 to send an IP packet that would be considered an invalid IP datagram.
This may cause some systems to hang or encounter other errors.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated files for Windows 95:

   PING.EXE version 4.00.1381.3 (dated 12/14/96) and later
   MSVCRT.DLL version 4.20.6164 (dated 6/17/96) and later

These files are included in the self-extracting PINGUPD.EXE file.
