SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print one page of a multiple-page document from WordPad to a
PostScript printer, a blank page may be printed instead of the page you
expected. This problem occurs only if you attempt to print a page other than the
first page of a multiple-page document.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 PostScript printer driver (Pscript.drv) does not properly print
individual pages of a multiple-page document from WordPad.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, print more than one page of the document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: multi-page multipage
