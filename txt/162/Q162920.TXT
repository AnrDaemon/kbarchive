CAUSE
=====

WordMail is enabled as the e-mail editor and is supplying the font.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine if WordMail is being used as the e-mail editor, click WordMail on
the Compose menu. If the Use Word As Your Email Editor check box is selected,
WordMail is controlling the default font.

To change the default WordMail font, Follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click WordMail Options, and note the default template
   listed.

2. Open that template in Microsoft Word. Email.dot is the default template name.

3. On the Format menu, click Font.

4. Select the font, size, and color you want, and then click Default.

This makes the font you selected the default for any new mail messages whenever
the template is used.
