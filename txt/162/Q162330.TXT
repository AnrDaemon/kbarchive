TITLE   :Err Msg: Windows NT Could Not Start...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows NT, the following error message may be displayed:

   Windows NT could not start because of a computer hardware configuration
   problem.

   Could not read from the selected boot disk. Check boot path and disk
   hardware.

   Please check the Windows NT(TM) documentation about hardware disk
   configuration and your hardware reference manuals for additional information.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any part of the arcpath statement in the Boot.ini
file uses all uppercase charcters. For example:

   MULTI(0)DISK(0)RDISK(0)PARTITION(1)\NT40="Windows NT Workstation
   Version 4.00"

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the arcpath statement to use lowercase letters. For example:

   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\NT40="Windows NT Workstation
   Version 4.00"

If the computer uses the FAT file system, boot from a bootable MS-DOS floppy disk
and perform the following steps:

1. Type the following line:

   attrib -s -h -r c:\boot.ini

2. Use any text editor to edit the Boot.ini file. Make the appropriate changes
   to the arcpath statement.

3. Save and then close the Boot.ini file.

4. Type the following line:

   attrib +s +h +r c:\boot.ini

If the type of file system is NTFS, you can use the Emergency Repair procedure to
fix this, choosing only the options to Inspect startup environment and Inspect
Boot Sector (unchecking the other two options).

To start the Emergency Repair procedure, insert your Windows NT setup floppy disk
#1 into your floppy drive and reboot your machine. Follow the instructions on
the screen, and press "R" for Repair when prompted.

Note that you do not need to have recently updated your Emergency Repair
information when choosing only the options to Inspect startup environment and
Inspect Boot Sector.
