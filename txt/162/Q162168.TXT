RESOLUTION

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To change the adapter selected back to primary (0):

1. Run the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   \SYSTEM
   \CurrentControlSet
   \Control
   \Print
   \Monitors
   \Hewlett-Packard Network Port
   \Options

3. Double-click Adapter:REG_DWORD:0x1.

4. In the DWORD Editor dialog box, change data from 1 to 0 and click OK.

5. Exit Regedt32.exe.

6. Stop and restart the spooler service.
