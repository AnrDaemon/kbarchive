TITLE   :XFOR: Messages Not Being Delivered to X.400 Recipients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Microsoft Exchange Client against a Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks postoffice to send mail to an X.400 recipient by means of the Microsoft
Mail Connector, the following non-delivery report (NDR) may be generated

   Delivery failed to
   X400:C=au;A=myadmd;P=myprmd;O=myorg;S=given.init.surname
   Reason: 1 (transfer impossible)
   diagnostic:  0 (OR name (Email address) unrecognized).

CAUSE
=====

When a new X.400 address is created using the Microsoft Mail template, the given
name, initials, and surname are combined into a personal name (PN) field. When
the Microsoft Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI) reads this PN field, it
incorrectly translates it to the Surname field only, rather than splitting the
field into Given Name, Initials, and Surname for correct delivery.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Send messages to addresses in the Global or Postoffice Address Lists as
   created by the administrator.

   -or-

1. Create new X.400 addresses using the "Other Address" option in the New Entry
   dialog box.

2. Type X400 as the E-mail type and type the full and correct X.400 address in
   the E-mail address field without using a PN value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
