SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document containing color text or images to a Hewlett- Packard
(HP) DeskJet 600 printer using version 7.0 of the printer driver, the entire
document may be printed in grayscale.

The printer driver may display a message prompting you to install the black
cartridge in the printer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the first page of the document does not contain any
color text or images.

The ColorSmart feature of the printer driver analyzes only the first page of the
document. If the first page contains no color, the driver assumes that the
entire document should be printed in grayscale. Neither the manual nor automatic
settings in the printer driver have any effect on this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

Insert color text or a color image on the first page of the document, or print
the document as two separate jobs, starting the second job on the first page
with color.
