TITLE   :IPX: Banner Page Prints When No One Is Logged On to Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Server has a printer shared out via Gateway Services for NetWare
that is serviced by a NetWare server that non-NetWare clients print to. The
Print Banner option is not selected and banners don't print under normal
circumstances. However, if the server is rebooted and no one logs on to the
console of the Windows NT Server, and if a client attempts to print to the
shared printer, a banner will be printed.

This doesn't appear to be reproducible by just logging off of the Windows NT
console.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
