======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order to specify that a Visual FoxPro report should sent to a particular
printer, it is customary to either change the Windows default printer or use the
PROMPT clause on the REPORT command to allow the user to select the printer.
However, it is possible to change the desired destination printer without using
either of these techniques. This article explains some methods for doing this
using SET PRINTER TO NAME [printer name].

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SET PRINTER TO NAME command allows the currently selected printer within
Visual FoxPro to be set to any printer installed under Windows. The list of
installed printers can be read into an array with the APRINTERS() function, or a
single printer name can be returned by the GETPRINTER() dialog.

NOTE: For this procedure to work, the report form must be saved with the Default
Printer selected from the Name drop-down box within the Print Setup dialog. This
dialog is called from the Page Setup dialog found under the File menu.

Example 1
---------

The following program displays the GETPRINTER() dialog to allow selection of a
printer from the installed printers. If OK is selected in the GetPrinter dialog,
a report called Test is sent to the selected printer. If the Cancel button is
selected in the GetPrinter dialog, the report is not printed.

      * Beginning of program for Example 1
      * *******************************************************
      * This program assumes a report called Test which has been
      * saved with the default printer in the Print Setup dialog.
      *
      LOCAL lcPrinter

      lcPrinter = ''
      lcPrinter = GETPRINTER()

      IF !EMPTY(lcPrinter)
         SET PRINTER TO NAME (lcPrinter)
         REPORT FORM Test TO PRINTER NOCONSOLE
      ELSE
         WAIT WINDOW 'Print Job Cancelled' TIME 1
      ENDIF
      *
      * End of program for Example 1

Notes:

Under Visual FoxPro 3.0 and 3.0b, the GETPRINTER() dialog is different, and the
dialog allows changing portrait/landscape settings, among others. These are
ignored when the report is printed.

Example 2
---------

The following program displays a custom form that has a drop-down list populated
with an array created with APRINTERS(). If you choose the "Print Report" command
button, a report called Test is sent to the selected printer. If you choose the
Cancel button, the report is not printed.

      * Beginning of program for Example 2
      *********************************************************
      * This program assumes a report called Test which has been
      * saved with the default printer in the Print Setup dialog.
