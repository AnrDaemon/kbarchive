PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a document containing drawing objects in Word 6.0 or Word 7.0, one
or more of the following symptoms may occur:

 - Auto Shapes (Drawing Objects) are displayed as outlines.

 - Half circular objects appear as complete circles.

 - Drawing objects are incomplete.

CAUSE
=====

The document was saved from Word 97 as Word 6.0/95 or Rich Text Format (RTF)
before you opened the file in Word 6.0 or Word 7.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To get the best conversion results for drawing objects between Word 97 and
previous versions of Word, use the Word 97-2000 Import Converter. For
information about how to obtain the converter, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the General tab, click to select the the "Confirm conversion at Open"
   check box.

3. Click OK.

4. Open the Word 97 document containing the drawing objects.

A Convert File dialog box appears. Make sure Word 97 is selected in the list, and
then click OK.

you open the file in either Word 6.0 or Word 7.0, even when you use the Word 97
converter.
