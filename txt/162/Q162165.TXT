TITLE   :SMS: Client Inventory Data Entered Under a New SMSID
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbDatabase kbInventory smsinv smsdatabasekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Systems Management Server Inventory Agent (INVDOS) is run on a computer
running Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.x, or Windows 95, the inventory
may report data to a new SMSID without modifying the Systems Management Server
Unique ID value in the client's Sms.ini file.

CAUSE
=====

Under certain conditions, the inventory agent fails in checking the SMSID in the
Sms.ini file. In this case, a new ID is generated. This ID is reflected in the
generated MIF file, and therefore the data is written into the database with the
new ID. The inventory agent does not write the new ID to the client's Sms.ini
file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2.


A supported fix is now available for version 1.1, but is not fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
