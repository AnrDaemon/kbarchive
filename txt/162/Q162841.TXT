SYMPTOMS
========

When an MS Mail postoffice is configured to participate in directory
synchronization (dir-sync) with a Microsoft Exchange Server, dir-sync traffic
from the MS Mail postoffice may generate a Non Delivery Report by the MS Mail
Connector Interchange service (MSMI), and never reach the Microsoft Exchange
Server Directory Synchronization service (DXA).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the postoffice name of the MS Mail postoffice is similar to that of the
Microsoft Exchange Server connector postoffice, the dir-sync messages will
generate a Non Delivery Report, and the following warning will be logged in the
Windows NT event log.
