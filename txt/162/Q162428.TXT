SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install or run The Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of
Dinosaurs, you may receive the following error message:

   The program detected that:
   -PCM Audio Codec is not installed or is not active The program will now
   install the missing components. <OK>

You will receive this message if the Microsoft ADPCM CODEC (audio compression
codec) is missing, damaged, or disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the Microsoft ADPCM CODEC by clicking OK on
this message. This will start the Windows setup. Follow the on screen
instructions, and after Windows Setup is complete, the program will install and
run properly.

If you are running MSB Dinosaurs on Microsoft Windows 2000, reinstall the
Microsoft ADPCM CODEC:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Add/Remove Hardware.

2. Click Next, click "Add/Troubleshoot a Device", and then click Next.

3. Click "Add a new device", and then click Next.

4. Click "No, I want to select the hardware from a list", and then click Next.

5. Click "Sound, video, and game controllers", and then click Next.

6. Click Have Disk. In the "Copy manufacturer's files from" box, point to
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Mmdriver.inf (where %SystemRoot% is the folder in which
   Windows 2000 is installed).

7. Click OK, and then click Microsoft ADPCM CODEC in the list.

8. Click Next, and then click Finish.

9. Restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Running Windows Setup to install the ADPCM codec will correct the problem if the
codec was missing. However, if the Microsoft ADPCM CODEC has been disabled in
the Multimedia Properties Advanced settings, it will remain disabled. If this is
the case, you will receive this error message again and Windows Setup will
install the codec every time you run the program. This will happen until the
codec is enabled in the Windows Control Panel.

For information about how to permanently enable the Microsoft ADPCM CODEC, please
