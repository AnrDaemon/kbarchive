TITLE   :Fragmentation and Performance Issues with PPTP Connections
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0

KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
 - Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Performance degradation may occur when you use Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
(PPTP) connections.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


This hotfix does the following:

 - Corrects an issue in TCP/IP that occasionally generates packets larger than
   1,500 bytes.

 - Corrects a resource allocation issue in TCP/IP that causes the stack (under
   heavy load) to drop forwarded packets instead of allocating more memory.

 - Changes the MTU for IP connections over NDISWan down to 1,400. This helps to
   keep from fragmenting when you are connecting with PPTP directly across a
   LAN.

If your PPTP connection is exhibiting any of these types of behavior, please
obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.

NOTE: Ndiswan.sys is the 40-bit version and Ndiswand.sys is the 128-bit version
of this file. If you are using 128-bit encryption, you will need to install
Ndiswand.sys and rename it to Ndiswan.sys to retain your encryption.

After you apply the fix, shut down and restart your computer.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Registry Change
---------------

The registry change below can be used to increase performance on a reliable
network. If the network is unreliable or congested, this setting should be set
to the default value; otherwise, set this value to 8.

NOTE: This registry change is not a requirement for the hotfix itself, but should
be used to gain performance under reliable conditions.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Raspptpe
   \Parameters\Configuration

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

4. Add the following value:

   Value Name: RxPacketWindow
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 2 (default)

   Set the data value to 8.

5. Click OK and then quit Registry Editor.

6. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
