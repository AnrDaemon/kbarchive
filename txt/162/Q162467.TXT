TITLE   :AppleTalkClientSupport and VinesClientSupport May Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt.32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Password changes using Apple Talk or Vines Protocol do not work as expected even
though the AppleTalkClientSupport and/or VinesClientSupport registry values have
been entered as a REG_DWORD set to 0x1 on the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

CAUSE
=====

A logic error in the Lsass.exe process prevents either of these two registry
values from functioning properly unless TcpipClientSupport and/or
NetwareClientSupport is added as a registry value as well.


RESOLUTION
==========

In addition to AppleTalkClientSupport and/or VinesClientSupport, also add
NetwareClientSupport (if NWLINK is installed) and/or TcpipClientSupport (if
TCPIP is installed) as directed in the MORE INFORMATION section below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Password changes using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over sockets to communicate
directly to Lsass.exe on the primary domain controller (PDC) is possible by
enabling appropriate registry values on the LSA key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

The registry values are based on the protocol being enabled, (not the type of
client) that socket support is intended for. (In other words, a Novell Netware
client using TCP/IP as its network protocol would require TcpipClientSupport
enabled on the PDC, not NetwareClientSupport.)

TcpipClientSupport is required for support of TCP/IP (ncacn_ip_tcp)
NetwareClientSupport is required for support of NWLINK protocol (ncacn_spx)
AppleTalkClientSupport is required for support of AppleTalk protocol
(ncacn_at_dsp)
VinesClientSupport is required for support of Vines protocol (ncacn_vns_spp)

These registry values must be created on the PDC (and should be created on all
BDCs) as REG_DWORD values set to 0x1. Also, the registry value should only be
created if the protocol it is intended to support has been installed on the
Windows NT server.
