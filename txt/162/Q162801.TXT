 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you dock one toolbar next to another toolbar, some of the buttons on one or
both of the toolbars are not visible. For example, when you dock the Formatting
toolbar to the right of the Standard toolbar, both toolbars fit within the
window width, some of the buttons are not visible, and both toolbars display two
chevron characters (>>) in the top right corner.

NOTE: This functionality is different from previous versions of Word where if you
dock one toolbar next to another, the second toolbar appears to run off the
screen.

CAUSE
=====

When you dock one toolbar next to another, Word hides some of the buttons and
adds the chevron characters to the toolbar that contains the hidden buttons. The
chevron characters allow you to identify a toolbar that contains hidden buttons.
You can quickly display the buttons on the toolbar by double-clicking the
chevron characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To see all of the buttons on a toolbar, use either of the following methods:

 - Double-click the chevron characters in the top right corner of the toolbar.

   The toolbar will "float" in the document area.

   -or-

 - Drag the toolbar to a new location.
