matter what type the application has set.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use either of the resolutions below. The first
resolution works manually from the user interface. The second resolution
requires you to modify a Windows NT file, but it works better in corporate
rollout scenarios. Each of these resolutions is described in more detail below.

   -or-

 - Make a change to the Qms1725.ppd file.

2. Select the QMS 1725 print system.

3. On the File menu, click Document Defaults.

4. Click the Advanced tab.

5. Expand the list of Document Options and Printer Features by clicking the plus
   sign (+) next to each.

6. In the Printer Features section, select Paper Tray.

7. In the list box at the bottom contains the list of available forms. Choose
   the form you want and then click OK.

Modify the Qms1725.ppd File
---------------------------

To make the required change, perform the following steps:

1. Expand the Qms1725.pp_ file from the Windows NT CD.

2. Open the file in a text editor (such as Notepad).

3. Search the file for "*DefaultPaperTray" (without the quotation marks).

4. On the line where DefaultPaperTray is found, replace "Letter" with the form
   name you want to use.

5. Save the file.

6. Use the following command to compress the file:

   compress /r /z qms1725.ppd

7. Copy the resulting Qms1725.pp_ file to the desired installation share.

8. Install Windows NT from this share or point existing installations to this
   share.
