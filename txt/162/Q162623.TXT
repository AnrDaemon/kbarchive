KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application may abruptly stop running and one of the following Dr. Watson
messages may appear:

   Could not attach to the application.
   Windows NT error code = 87

-or-

   Windows NT Error Code 87

A log file is then created and when the user opens the log file, there is no
special entry except:

   The Error reported is

   Could not Attach to the application
   Windows NT Error Code 87

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when an application abnormally terminates itself or is
unexpectedly terminated by another application, thus causing an access
violation. Windows NT Error Code 87 occurs when Dr. Watson loads to log the
error, but the process is shut down before Dr. Watson can access it to gather
debug information.

Because Dr. Watson does not attach itself to the application, no debugging
information is available in the log file.

This error is not the result of Windows NT closing down the application.
