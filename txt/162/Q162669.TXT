SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to prevent Printer Job Language (PJL) commands from
being sent with a print job. In some network situations, it may be necessary to
do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable PJL commands, you must edit the .spd file for the PostScript printer
you are using.

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the .spd file.

2. Locate the line beginning with:

   *Protocols:

3. Delete the word "PJL" from this line.

4. Save and close the file.

5. Delete the corresponding .wpx file from the Windows\System folder. (This file
   contains information from the .spd file. When you delete this file, the .spd
   file is read again to re-create the .wpx file.)

6. Restart Windows 95.

PJL commands are sent by the Windows 95 PostScript printer driver to
multiple-language printers that are compatible with Hewlett-Packard's Printer
Job Language controls to switch to the PostScript language and perform other job
control functions.

PJL Commands usually have the following format:

   <ESC>%-12345X@PJL...

Some network spoolers have problems with these commands if they look specifically
for PostScript document fields to define the parameters of the print job.
