The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In PowerPoint, a Microsoft Word table with borders will not be displayed
correctly: some of the borders may be missing.

This problem is a display problem only. The table borders print correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1).

WORKAROUND
==========

To allow the Word table borders to be displayed correctly in PowerPoint, apply a
thicker border to the Word table:

1. In PowerPoint, select the Word table by dragging the mouse over the entire
   table.

2. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading.

3. Click the Border tab. Under setting, click the desired type of border. Change
   the Width to a thick value; for example, 1 1/2 pt or greater. Make any other
   changes to the borders, as desired, and then click OK.

   NOTE: Be sure to apply the thick borders to the outside border, as well as the
   inner borders of the table. Also, some of the borders may appear thicker than
   others.

4. Click outside the Word table to return to PowerPoint.

The Word table borders should now be displayed correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97
