KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you suspend and then resume a laptop computer with the hardware
Power/Resume button, the computer may power off instead.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 power management driver may not properly handle a suspend request
and cause the computer to power off when the following conditions exist:

 - The computer is a laptop computer with a BIOS option to select the power-up
   (or resume) mode. Such an option determines whether the power button actually
   powers the computer on and off (for a full reboot), or simply suspends and
   resumes the computer.

 - The power-up (or resume) mode option is set to resume mode.

 - The computer is placed in its docking station and powered on.

 - The power button is pressed to place the computer in a suspended state.

 - The power button is pressed again to resume the computer.

 - Instead of resuming, the computer peforms a full power-off after about 30
   seconds.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, set the power-up (or resume) mode option to boot mode
instead of resume mode. This causes the computer to completely power off when it
is shut down and perform a full boot when restarted, instead of suspending when
shut down and resuming when restarted.


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Depending on the state of programs running when the computer is first suspended,
current data that has not been saved to disk may be lost.

This symptom has been reported to occur with the following models of laptop
computers:

 - Toshiba Tecra 710/720/730

 - Toshiba Tecra 500 Series

 - Toshiba Portege 650
