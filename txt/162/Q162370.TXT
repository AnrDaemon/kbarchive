-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 6.0, you may
receive the following error message:

   Invalid Page Fault in Winsmsg.dll.

The program will stop and return you to the Windows 95 Desktop.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this error message, reduce the scroll rate for the aircraft
communications as follows:

1. On the Aircraft menu, click Communications.

2. Move the Communications Rate slider bar to the Low position.

3. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above error message is rare. The Winsmsg.dll controls the window that the
communication message scrolls in. Reducing the scroll rate will usually resolve
this problem.

Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs have also been known to cause this
problem. If reducing the scroll rate does not resolve this issue, check for any
TSR's that may be running in the background, including any Virus detection
programs.
