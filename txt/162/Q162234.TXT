======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cascading style sheets consist of several parts:

 - A STYLE tag specified inside the HEAD tag that describes the appearance and
   behavior of other elements on the page.

 - A LINK tag placed inside the HEAD tag that references an external style sheet
   via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

 - The ID, CLASS, and STYLE attributes that can be specified on all tags inside
   the BODY.

FrontPage correctly preserves the STYLE and LINK tags in the head all the time,
but it only preserves the ID, CLASS, and STYLE attributes if they occur within
an HTML tag that supports extended attributes.

SYMPTOMS
========

Some elements of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are discarded by FrontPage Editor.
For example, FrontPage Editor correctly preserves the STYLE and LINK tags placed
within the HEAD element, but it only preserves the ID, CLASS, and STYLE
attributes some of the time.

CAUSE
=====

ID, CLASS, and STYLE attributes in the BODY section of your document are not
preserved if they occur within an HTML tag that does not support extended
attributes.
