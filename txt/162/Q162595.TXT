TITLE   :NTFS Causes Windows NT Server to Stop Responding
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under stressful conditions the Windows NT File System (NTFS) may fail. Processes
accessing the NTFS volume may continue to run in a reduced functional state or
they may stop responding entirely.

CAUSE
=====

NTFS synchronizes access to the meta-data streams with a per-file resource.
There is a path in Create where the resource can be dropped and reacquired. In
this case, a close on the same directory came in while the resource was being
dropped.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.
