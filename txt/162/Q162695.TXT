TITLE   :SMSINST: "Access Denied" Message When Connecting to a Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although printing is still possible, users of computers running Windows NT
Workstation that connect to a network printer share see "access denied" in the
printer window caption when they do the following:

1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and click Printers.

2. Double-click the shared network printer icon.

Therefore, the printer queue that is displayed is empty and the user cannot
control (for example, delete or cancel) his or her own print jobs.

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Installer cannot handle multiple REG_MULTI_SZ registry
entries; only the first entry of such a registry entry is used in the package.

The problem has been experienced after the installation of a third-party product
that added entries to the following registry keys:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlset\Services\LanmanServer
   \Parameters\NullSessionShares

   -and-

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ CurrentControlset\Services\LanmanServer
   \Parameters\NullSessionPipes

In this case, when a Systems Management Server package was created, Systems
Management Server distributed only the first of the REG_MULTI_SZ entries named
above; all other entries (for example, spoolss) were lost under the
NullSessionPipes key. This caused workstations to get an "access denied" message
when connecting to the printer share.



WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this problem, use an external utility designed for editing
multi-string registry values. Execution of such utilities can be accomplished
within Systems Management Server Installer by using the Execute Program script
item.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0, Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0, and Windows NT
Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0.
