TITLE   :WD97: No Connectors Command on AutoShapes Menu
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbofficeupdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Word 97 does not have a Connectors command on the AutoShapes menu. A connector
is a line that connects two objects.

CAUSE
=====

Word 97 does not support the use of connectors in a Word document.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use any of the following methods to simulate connectors in Word.

Method 1: Install and Use Microsoft Draw 98
-------------------------------------------

If you are a registered Microsoft Office user, you can download and install
Microsoft Draw 98. Microsoft Draw 98 makes the OfficeArt drawing tools,
including connectors, available in any OLE-compliant application. You can obtain
Microsoft Draw 98 from the following Web site:

   http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/draw98.aspx

To use Microsoft Draw 98 from Word:

On the Insert menu, point to Picture, and then click New Drawing.

Method 2: Use the Line AutoShape in Word
----------------------------------------

Draw a connector line using one of the following AutoShapes:

 - Line

 - Arrow

 - Double Arrow

 - Curve

 - Freeform

 - Scribble

NOTE: The connector lines that you create using this method function differently
from the connector lines available in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft PowerPoint.
When you move one of the objects, the connector line does not follow the
object.

Method 3: Use Microsoft Excel or PowerPoint
-------------------------------------------

1. Start Microsoft Excel or PowerPoint.

2. If it is not already visible, display the Drawing toolbar. (On the View menu,
   point to Toolbars, and then click Drawing.)

   The Drawing toolbar appears at the bottom of the window.

3. Click AutoShapes on the Drawing toolbar, point to an AutoShape type, such as
   Basic Shapes, and then click the shape you want.

4. On the Drawing toolbar, click AutoShapes, point to Connectors, and then click
   the connector you want. Drag the mouse pointer between the objects you want
   to connect.

5. On the Drawing toolbar, click Select Objects, and then select the objects you
   created in steps 3 and 4.

6. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

7. Switch to Word.

8. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

NOTE: When you paste this object into Word, the connector line is converted into
a simple line. It is not attached to the two objects at either end. If you move
one object, the connector line does not follow the object. In Microsoft Excel or
PowerPoint, when you move an object at either end of the connector line, the
connector follows the object.
