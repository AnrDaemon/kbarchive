TITLE   :Thumbnail Image Doesn't Appear on Expected Gallery Page
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER::3.0; WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbole kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Clip Gallery for Windows 95, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Publisher 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add clips to the Clip Gallery, by choosing Import Clips on the Clip
Gallery window, you can't control which page (tab) the thumbnail appears on. For
example, if you are currently viewing the Clip Art page and you insert a clip
for a graphic with an .bmp extension, the thumbnail appears on the Pictures
page.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Clip Gallery uses the term "clip art" to refer to any
vector-based graphic and places thumbnails for these files on the Clip Art page.
Clip Gallery uses the term "picture" to refer to any raster-based graphics and
places those thumbnails in the Picture page.

raster-based: (NOTE: this is not a complete list of graphic formats)
