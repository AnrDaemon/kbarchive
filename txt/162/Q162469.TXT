KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP3 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 contains an updated version of the HyperTerminal
product included with Windows NT. If you installed Hilgraeve's Private Edition,
you may need to reinstall this application after you install Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HyperTerminal Private Edition is an enhanced version of the HyperTerminal
application provided with Windows NT.

The default installation behavior of HyperTerminal Private Edition is to "Install
where HyperTerminal is normally located (This will overwrite HyperTerminal.)"
However, Service Pack 3 overwrites HyperTerminal Private Edition version 3.0
without warning. HyperTerminal provided with Windows NT 4.0 is identified as
version 4.0 (version of the operating system). The update supplied with Service
Pack 3 is considered more recent.

To work around this issue, you must reinstall HyperTerminal Private Edition after
Service Pack 3 has been applied.

If "Specify a new directory and Start menu location (This will leave
HyperTerminal intact.)" is selected during the installation of HyperTerminal
Private Edition, Service Pack 3 does not overwrite HyperTerminal Private Edition
and reinstallation is not necessary.

The Hyperterminal product discussed here is manufactured by Hilgraeve Inc. a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
