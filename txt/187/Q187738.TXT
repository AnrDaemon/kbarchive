SUMMARY
=======

After an upgrade from Internet Information Server (IIS) 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 on a
computer with multiple virtual servers, you may find that you have extra virtual
directories under each server that were not defined under the previous version.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under IIS 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, a virtual directory could be defined without an IP
address. This virtual directory was considered "global" for all servers on that
computer. Under IIS 4.0, this is no longer the case, and all virtual directories
must be explicitly defined for each Web server.

During the upgrade process, if the Setup program notices that the server has a
"global" virtual directory, Setup adds the virtual directory to each of the Web
sites on the computer, because there is no way to determine which server the
original virtual directory was defined for.
