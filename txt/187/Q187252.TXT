PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdtakbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a table and specify non-breaking spaces using the &nbsp;
character entity in some of the table cells, FrontPage Editor may remove the
&nbsp; character entities from your HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
document.

CAUSE
=====

FrontPage Editor will not retain the &nbsp; character entities if a table
cell has an explicit height setting because the &nbsp; would force a minimum
height for the cell. When parsing the HTML, FrontPage Editor removes any
&nbsp; character entities it deems extraneous.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the FrontPage 98b patch. You can obtain this update from the following
Microsoft World Wide Web site:

   http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/fp98bupd.aspx
