PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a Terminal Server that is at its maximum number of
connections allowed, you may receive the following error message:

   Because of a network error, the session will be disconnected. Please try to
   reconnect.

CAUSE
=====

The host has exceeded the maximum number of connections available. When a
Terminal Server exceeds its maximum network connection limit, an event is logged
so that the administrator knows why the network client was rejected. The network
client will receive the above error message.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: misleading too many
