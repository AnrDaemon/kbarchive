TITLE   :The FTP PORT Command Fails in IIS 3.0
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

There is the possibility that, when the PORT command is sent to the FTP services
on a Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 3.0 system that has
more than one network interface card, the PORT command will fail with the
following error:

   Error 425, can't open data connection

CAUSE
=====

When the FTP server connects to the client's data socket, IIS 3.0 will bind the
socket to the first available address on the system. After applying this patch
IIS 3.0 will now bind to the address of the user initiating the request.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Server version 3.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
