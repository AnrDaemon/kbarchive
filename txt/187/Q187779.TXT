TITLE   :XADM: Error: Warning [30] Message Contains Duplicate Email Addre
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a new Exchange Server computer has been added to an Exchange Server site,
that is a requestor in directory synchronization (dirsync) with a Microsoft Mail
3.x postoffice (PO), the following warnings may appear in the Dirsync log:

    Warning [154]Non delivery report
    Warning [30] 154 Message contains duplicate email address. Mail item
    was not delivered to(requestor name)

Address lists updates will not be propagated to the Exchange Server site, and no
errors or warnings will show up in the Event Log for the Exchange requestor.

CAUSE
=====

The new Exchange Server computer has been given the Microsoft Mail address
"SHADOWNET\SHADOWPO\SYSTEM1" under the Directory Synchronization tab as the
Requestor server. Consequently, the errors occur and dirsync stops functioning.

Usually, when a new server is added to the site, directory replication checks for
other MS Mail connectors and if it finds any, it automatically increments the MS
Mail address in sequential order. For example, if a fourth Exchange Server
computer is added to a site with an MS Mail connector, as a dirsync requestor,
it will look for the connector during directory replication, and then assign it
the address SHADOWNET\SHADOWPO\SYSTEM4.

WORKAROUND
==========

On the Directory Synchronization Properties page, highlight the new server and
edit the Microsoft Mail e-mail address.
