The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.02, 8.03, on platform(s):

SUMMARY
=======

To view calendar information in a public folder, you can create a link to the
calendar from the public folder.

For example, if you have a lot of conference rooms set up with mailboxes, and you
would like for your users to be able to view the calendar information for a
conference room without having to go into Meeting Planner, you can create a link
to view the calendar contents.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a link to a calendar and place the link in a public folder, do the
following:

1. Open a new mail message. Make sure the window is not maximized, so that you
   can see the client in the background.

2. Click the calendar. While holding the mouse button down, hover the mouse
   pointer over the mail message on the task bar. After a few seconds, the mail
   message will become the active window. Continue holding the mouse button
   down, move the mouse pointer into the mail message window, and then release
   the mouse button. A link file will appear as an attachment in the mail
   message.

   NOTE: You must click on the calendar that appears in the Folder List, not the
   Outlook Bar.

3. If you need to rename the file, right-click the link file, and click
   Properties. Change the Label text, and click OK.

4. Click the link file and drag it into the public folder of your choice.

5. In the client, the user must give permissions on his or her calendar to the
   other users that need to view the calendar. This can be done by
   right-clicking on the calendar and choosing Properties. On the Permissions
   tab, add the specific user or group with the level of permissions you want.

NOTE: The public folder must not have been created to hold appointments.

Repeat this procedure for each calendar you want to view from the public folder.

To view the calendar information, double click the Calendar item in the public
folder.
