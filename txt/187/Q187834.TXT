SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to select a range of cells and how to unselect a
range of selected cells using the MSFlexGrid control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual Basic documentation provides a good explanation in the Online Help of
how to select a range of cells in a MSFlexgrid control. However, there is no
such explanation for how to undo a selection that has already been made. The
example below demonstrates both.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Click Components on the Project menu, check "Microsoft FlexGrid Control," and
   then click OK.

3. Add a MSFlexGrid control to Form1.

4. Add two CommandButtons to Form1.

5. Change the Caption property of Command1 to "UnSelect."

6. Change the Caption property of Command2 to "Select."

7. Add the following code to the module of Form1:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
         ' unselect a range
         With MSFlexGrid1
            ' cancel selection by setting end points to start points
            .RowSel = .Row
            .ColSel = .Col
            .SetFocus
         End With
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
         ' select a range
         With MSFlexGrid1
            ' Row and Col properties must be set before RowSel and ColSel
            .Col = 0 ' start selection in this column
            .Row = 2 ' start selection in this row
            .ColSel = 1 ' end selection in this column
            .RowSel = 4 ' end selection in this row
            .SetFocus
         End With
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
         With MSFlexGrid1
            .Clear
            .FixedCols = 0
            .FixedRows = 0
            .AddItem "mike" & vbTab & 10, 0
            .AddItem "fred" & vbTab & 11, 1
            .AddItem "jack" & vbTab & 13, 2
            .AddItem "herman" & vbTab & 55, 3
            .AddItem "irene" & vbTab & 88, 4
            .AddItem "jane" & vbTab & 22, 5
         End With
         End Sub

8. Press the F5 key to run the project. Click on the "Select" button. You should
   see the middle of the MSFlexGrid selected.

9. Click on the "UnSelect" button, and note that the selection is undone.
