SUMMARY
=======

If you do not like the default color and font that the Genhtml program uses when
you save a form or report to HTML, you can change the color and font in the
Genhtml.dbf file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, if you do not call Genhtml programmatically with the style parameter
to create a Web page, Genhtml creates the page(s) with a silver background and a
standard font. To change the default color and font try using the following
sample code:

      USE HOME()+"GENHTML.DBF"
      LOCATE FOR ID = 'VFPDefault'
      REPLACE Style WITH 'table{color:red; font-size:18pt;
      font-family:Arial}', prescript WITH '_oHTML.body.bgColor="blue"'
      USE

This code changes the default color and text to an 18 point Arial font with red
text and a blue background. The next time you save an item as HTML, the program
uses the new color and font.

NOTE: If you cannot find your Genhtml.dbf file, you must run the Genhtml.prg
program once. The easiest way to do this is to browse a table and from the File
menu, select "Save As HTML".
