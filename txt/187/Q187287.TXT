TITLE   :SMS: PCM Does Not Remind Users of Pending Commands
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a new package is available, Package Command Manager (PCM), during its
polling cycle, will appear and show the user that there is a pending command. If
the user is busy and closes PCM at that time, the user will not be reminded of
the pending command again until either the package mandatory date passes or PCM
is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS section
of this article, or wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack.
The hotfix should have the following timestamp:

      3/24/98   3:49pm        463,264 Pcmwin32.exe (Intel)
      3/24/98   3:49pm      1,164,560 Pcmwin32.exe (Alpha)

Note that this fix only applies to the 32-bit desktop version of PCM.

In addition to applying the hotfixed file mentioned above, you must add the
following entry to the [Local] section of the Sms.ini file:

   PCMPackageReminderInterval=

This value should be set to a value (in minutes) greater than the PCM polling
interval. PCM will remind the user of pending commands (by reappearing), if all
of the conditions below are true:

 - There is at least one pending package.

 - The reminder interval is greater than zero.

 - The internal timer is at or below zero by the time the next polling pass is
   done.

Setting the value above to zero or removing the value completely causes PCM to
return to the default behavior of no reminders. Note that manually starting PCM
does not reset the internal timer.
