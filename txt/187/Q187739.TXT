-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Any change to an existing virtual root in the registry will not be reflected in
the metabase while Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 is running, even if the
server is stopped and restarted. However, any new virtual root information is
added once the server is stopped and restarted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Web server starts, it migrates all "new" virtual roots to the metabase
("new" means not already in the metabase). The server then turns around and
deletes all registry virtual roots and mirrors the virtual roots from the
metabase to the registry. Any change to the metabase virtual roots re-mirrors
the virtual roots to the registry, deleting anything that was changed in the
registry.
