TITLE   :Domain Controllers Being Replaced in 1C List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A condition can exist where the domain controller name can be replaced, or an
invalid entry can be added to the 1C list in your Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS) database. This can cause problems for clients authenticating to the
domain.

CAUSE
=====

This condition happens when a Remote Access Service (RAS) user connects to the
network with a domain controller with the same name as the corporate domain. The
RAS-connected domain controller then registers in WINS. If the primary domain
controller (PDC) is down or off the network, you can replace the PDC's 1C entry,
and the 1B entry can be replaced on the corporate WINS servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft recommends that RAS users resolve their names and register with an
isolated WINS server, to which the rest of the WINS infrastructure pushes its
registrations. This will allow the RAS users to resolve the names of the
computers on the corporate network but will not allow internal users to resolve
the external RAS user's name. Stopping the registrations of the RAS users being
propagated to the internal solves the problem.
