======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When browsing an Internet Information Server (IIS) Web site from Netscape
Navigator version 4.05, the following error message may occur:

   HTTP Error 400

   400 Bad Request

   Due to malformed syntax, the request could not be understood by the
   server. The client should not repeat the request without
   modifications.

CAUSE
=====

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that Navigator is attempting to open contains
a space.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - On the server, rename the file that contains a space to another name that
   does not contain a space.

   -or-

 - In the Navigator Location text box, substitute "%20" (without the quotation
   marks) for the space in the URL. The string "%20" is the URL encoding
   equivalent of a space character.

   For example, if the URL is

   http://example.microsoft.com/has space.htm

   instead use:

   http://example.microsoft.com/has%20space.htm

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you view directories in "directory browse" format (no default.htm in the
directory), the link at the top of the page called "[To Parent Directory]" is
not URL-encoded with a %20 in place of any space-character in the filename.

When you use Netscape Navigator version 4.05 and click the link, the Web server
stops responding and the error message occurs.
