TITLE   :XADM: Information Store Stops While Processing Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The information store stops after receiving an Internet message. The following
description is included in an event in the Event Viewer's application log, (the
event IDs may vary).

   An error (0x80004005) occurred while rendering a message for download
   on mailbox /O=<Organization >/OU=<Site >/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=<mailbox>.

The common event IDs are 5000, 1120, and 1121 from the MSExchangeIS.

A non-delivery report may also be generated prior to the information store
shutting down. It includes the following:

   MSEXCH:IMS:<ORG>:<Site>:<Server> 0x80004005
   (000502CC) Conversion to Internet format failed

CAUSE
=====

Certain applications may add an NLS entry in the registry mapping 50000
(User-Defined ) to cp1252.nls. The information store has an internal codepage
mapping table that maps raw codepages to 12 bit, and unless these get updated to
add a mapping for the new codepage, the store will fail to furnish properties to
Imail on outbound.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
