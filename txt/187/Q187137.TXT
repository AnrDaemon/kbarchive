-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create users with the Add user account, you cannot modify the home
directory to a different folder on the local computer. You can, however, create
a path on another computer.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select Start/Programs/Administrative Tools/Administrative Wizards/Add
User Account, the Add User Account wizard is launched. Choose Home Directory and
click NEXT. The only choice on the local computer is:

   \default home directory on the user's computer

There is no choice to let the Administrator give a path to any other local
folders.
