TITLE   :WD97: Saving a Document as HTML Causes Table Formatting Changes
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Word document, when you select a bordered table, copy and paste it several
times throughout the document, save it in HTML format, and then view it in a Web
browser, the table formatting will be different and some text within the table
will disappear.

CAUSE
=====

The HTML converter, Html32.cnv, does not properly convert bordered tables that
have been copied from one part of a Word document to another part of the
document prior to saving it in HTML format. Further, the HTML conversion from a
Word document will not include the text of the cells in the tables that were
copied.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Word 2000.
