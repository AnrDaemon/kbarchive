SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows NT version 4.0 SLIP connection, you are able to use
Winsock-type traffic such as telnet, ftp, and ping, but you are not able to do
any NBT traffic such as a domain logon (checking logon using DUN box), net use,
or net view. In the SLIP entry, the proper entries for DNS, WINS, and even
LMHOSTS are provided. You are not able to do a net use using the IP address of
the server or the name. NBT traffic does not work over a Windows NT SLIP
connection if you capture the network traffic.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue in the Rasiphlp.dll file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
