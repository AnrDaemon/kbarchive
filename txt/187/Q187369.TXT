TITLE   :SMS: SETLS Stores File Time of Win.ini File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120sp4fixkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Smsls.ini file is used to map Systems Management Server clients to a
specific site, SETLS will store the following upon a successful client mapping:

 - Name and file time of the .ini file used

 - Key and Value used to determine the domain

 - Domain name

SETLS later uses this information to determine whether it should perform its
mapping routines. If the Win.ini file is used for mapping, its file time is
stored. Any change to the Win.ini file causes SETLS to perform its mapping
routines. This may be undesirable, due to the length of time that the SETLS
mapping routines can take.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
