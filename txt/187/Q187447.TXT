======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you unlock a workstation during a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client
session) by providing an administrator name and password, the station is logged
off and there is no new session for the administrator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you unlock a session as administrator, you are presented with a dialog that
states, "This will log off the current user. Any unsaved work will be lost." If
you select OK, the dialog disappears. After about one minute, the client shuts
down.


RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design. When the current user is logged off, this shuts down
the client.
