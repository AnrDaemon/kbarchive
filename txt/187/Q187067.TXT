TITLE   :Multitasking Hotkeys Do Not Work in Terminal Server Session
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

The normal task-switching hotkey combinations for Microsoft Windows operating
systems, such as Windows NT, Windows 9x, and so on, are not passed through the
Terminal Server client session to the Terminal Server. However, alternative key
combinations are provided on the Terminal Server Client to offer the same
functionality:

 - ALT+PGUP = ALT+TAB
 - ALT+PGDN = ALT+SHIFT+TAB
 - ALT+INSERT = ALT+ESC
 - ALT+HOME = CTRL+ESC
 - ALT+DEL = ALT+SPACEBAR
 - CTRL+ALT+END = CTRL+ALT+DEL

SYMPTOMS
========

When using multitasking hotkeys, such as ALT+TAB, within a Terminal Server
session, the keystroke combination is processed on the local desktop that is
running the Terminal Server client software, task switching back to the Windows
95/Windows NT desktop, rather than between applications in the Terminal Server
client session.
