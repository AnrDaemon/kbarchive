For a Microsoft FrontPage 98 version of this article, see Q194247.

SYMPTOMS
========

The hyperlink information that is displayed in FrontPage Explorer is not the
same as the information that is stored in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
code of the Web page.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because FrontPage Explorer always updates the hyperlink
information in FrontPage Editor if you rename a file.

This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

 - You create a Web page in FrontPage Editor that contains a hyperlink to
   another Web page.

   -and-

 - You rename the Web page that is referenced by the hyperlink in FrontPage
   Explorer.

   -and-

 - The page that contains the hyperlink to the Web page with the changed name is
   open in FrontPage Editor.

NOTE: The hyperlink is updated in FrontPage Editor even though you click No when
you are prompted to update the link in FrontPage Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, close FrontPage Editor before you rename files in
FrontPage Explorer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
