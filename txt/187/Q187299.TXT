SUMMARY
=======

Persist.exe is a self-extracting compressed file that demonstrates how to
persist objects in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. For the purpose of this article,
if you can answer "yes" to the following question, then you have object
persistence:

   Can I save this object for later use?

When an object is created in Visual Basic (by instantiating a Visual Basic
class), that object exists in memory and is destroyed when the application that
created it is closed. This article demonstrates how to write the property values
of an object to a file, in other words, "persist" the object. The object can
later be recreated from the disk file, even if the computer has been shut down
and restarted. Visual Basic version 6.0 introduces the capability for persisting
objects in this manner.
