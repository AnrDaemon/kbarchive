TITLE   :Difficult to Determine Who Is Connected to a Terminal Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect a network client to a Terminal Server, the title bar in the
network client window includes the Terminal Server name you are connected to.
When multiple connections exist, you can locate each of them by looking at the
title bars. However, it may not be easy to determine from your multiple client
windows which user is connected on each server.

CAUSE
=====

The username information is not available to the client software. Also, the
title is rearranged to show the server name first, so, if you connect to
different servers, you can locate the correct one using the server name.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
