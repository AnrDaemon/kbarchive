TITLE   :Unable to Create a New Session
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user may log on from a computer where the user connects to the Windows
Terminal Server with a login name of GUEST, and then disconnects. On a computer
other than the first, a different user connects to the same Windows Terminal
Server with same login name GUEST. The second user is reconnected to the
previously disconnected session opened by the first user.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a specific setting in the Terminal Connection
Configuration utility.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is a feature that may be turned off or on in the Terminal Server
Connection Configuration utility. By selecting the Advanced tab in Terminal
Server Connection Configuration, you can set the default option. While on this
menu, in the "On a broken or timeout session" drop down menu, you can choose to
either disconnect or reset the session. Select reset, and new connections may be
made under the same user name.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
