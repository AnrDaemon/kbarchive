TITLE   :PRB: Class Builder Does Not Save the Built Class
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Class Builder Add-In does not save the class to the project the user is
working in. When the Class Builder is executing and a user has entered in
Attributes for a new event, if the user attempts to exit the Class Builder it
does not prompt for updating the project with the class information.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create the class by selecting Add Class Module on the Project menu. In the Add
Class Module window, select Class Module, and then use the Tools menu to add the
event by selecting Add Procedure. Once the event is added, select Procedure
Attributes from the Tools menu to add attributes to the class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
