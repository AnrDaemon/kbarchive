TITLE   :Published Application Session Does Not Offer Logoff
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this environment the administrator will want to:

 - Modify the Connection Configuration advanced properties for the connection
   being used, so disconnected sessions will timeout and shut down. If the
   administrator has groups of users who use the single application feature, and
   others who do not, then:

   Add one or more network interface cards (NICs) to the Terminal Server, and
   define a unique connection in Connection Configuration for each NIC. At that
   point, you can direct single application users to one connection (where
   disconnected sessions time out quickly and are shutdown), and other normal
   desktop users can use a different connection where the timeout is longer or
   non-existent.

   If the administrator wants more granular control, then

 - Set the disconnect timer for individual users under

   UserManager\username\Config

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a Terminal Server with a published application session, or
when you connect to a Terminal Server with a session limited to a specified
application, you cannot log off because there is no task bar and therefore, no
Start option is available. You can only disconnect by closing the client windows
by exiting the published application.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.
