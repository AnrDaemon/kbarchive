TITLE   :Upgrading from WinFrame 1.7 to Terminal Server 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can upgrade your computer from Citrix WinFrame 1.7 to Terminal Server
Edition 4.0. This article describes a few differences that occur during Setup
that do not occur in a typical Terminal Server installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Early in the upgrade process, you receive a message stating that the existing
WinFrame connections are preserved but disabled. This means that the Independent
Computing Architecture (ICA) connection definitions from WinFrame's winstation
configuration are disabled.

To re-enable ICA connection definitions, you must obtain Citrix's add-on product
(MetaFrame) for Terminal Server. You can use MetaFrame to allow a Citrix ICA
client to use an ICA connection as defined in the Terminal Server Connection
Configuration to connect to the Terminal Server computer.

After you upgrade, the defined ICA connections are not preserved. If you open the
Terminal Server Connection Configuration, only the default RDP-TCP connection is
displayed. (This is a known problem in Terminal Server.)

During the upgrade, you have the option of installing Microsoft Internet
Information Server, but you do not have the option to install Microsoft Internet
Explorer 4.0. (This is also a known problem in Terminal Server.) You can install
Internet Explorer 4.0 from the Terminal Server CD-ROM.

Otherwise, the upgrade preserves user accounts and groups, including any account
options such as the Terminal Server profile path, connection timeouts, and other
options specific to WinFrame/Terminal Server. Also, if WinFrame's hard disk
letters were modified (typically drive C becomes drive M, drive D becomes drive
N, and so on), these modifications are preserved.

A number of Citrix registry values are also preserved. These values are located
in the following registry keys:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
