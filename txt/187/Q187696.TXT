SUMMARY
=======

This article describes changes made to the Calculator application in Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Switching Between Standard and Scientific
-----------------------------------------

In Service Pack 4 and later, Calculator now clears the display when switching
between the Standard and Scientific views. To transfer numbers between Standard
and Scientific view, follow these steps:

1. Click MS to store the displayed number.

2. On the View menu, click the desired view.

3. Click MR to recall the stored number.

NOTE: A number typed in hexadecimal, octal, or binary format will be converted to
decimal format when transferring from Scientific to Standard view.

Understanding Extended Precision
--------------------------------

Extended Precision, a new feature of Calculator, means that all operations are
accurate to at least 32 digits. Calculator also stores rational numbers as
fractions to retain accuracy. For example, 1/3 is stored as 1/3, rather than
.333. However, errors accumulate during repeated operations on irrational
numbers. For example, Calculator will truncate pi to 32 digits, so repeated
operations on pi will lose accuracy as the number of operations increases.

New Additional Information
--------------------------

The following applies to all versions of the Calculator even though it is not
documented in Service Pack 3 and earlier.

Performing Calculations with Large Numbers
------------------------------------------

In the hexadecimal, octal, and binary number systems, Calculator displays only
the lower digits of an answer when the result has more digits than your display
size allows. This behavior mimics the way calculations work in computers.

DWORD results can contain up to eight digits; Word results can contain up to four
digits; and Byte results can contain up to two digits.

For example, using the hexadecimal number system displayed as Word, the largest
result you can generate is FFFF (equal to 65535 in decimal). If you double that
number (FFFFx2), the answer is 1FFFE. This contains five digits, so Calculator
will display only the lower four digits of the answer: FFFE.
