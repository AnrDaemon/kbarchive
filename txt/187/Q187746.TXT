DOCUMENT:Q187746  22-FEB-2000  [foxpro]
TITLE   :BUG: ERROR MESSAGE() Function with ODBC Connection Causes Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Placing the ERROR MESSAGE() function before or after an SQLCONN() command causes
Visual FoxPro 5.0x to perform an illegal operation under Windows NT 4.0. Under
Windows 95, the following error appears:

   This application has performed and illegal operation and will be shutdown.

Clicking the Details button reveals the following message:

   VFP caused an invalid page fault in module <unknown> at <memory
   address>.

CAUSE
=====

The behavior only occurs when the ERROR MESSAGE text is a null string. If any
error occurs before SQLConnect() is called, ERROR MESSAGE() reports the text of
the last error, and the code does not cause the memory protection fault.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Create a program that contains the following code and run the program:

      #DEFINE connectionstring ;
         'driver={sql server};server=sql;database=pubs;uid=sa;pwd='
      connhand = SQLSTRINGCONNECT(connectionstring)
      = SQLDISCONN(connhand)
      ERROR MESSAGE()   && causes error in VFP 5.0x

After the code runs, the error described in the SYMPTOMS section appears.
