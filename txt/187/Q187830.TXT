TITLE   :Performance Decrease Transmitting Data over the Network
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix sbs

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The TransmitFile() Win32 API call reads the file data directly from the file
system cache and sends it out over the wire. However, during periods of stress,
applications that use this API to transfer files across the network may see that
the transfer is not as fast when there are less than 4 KB streams of data being
transmitted.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT is reading 4 KB at a time as opposed to larger (and more efficient)
units.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
