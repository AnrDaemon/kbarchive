SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a SSL certificate request file using Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) 4.0 Key Manager (after filling out the Key Name,
Password, Organization, Organization Unit, and Common Name), if you type "H" for
"Hong Kong" inside the Country drop-down list box, you cannot find "Hong Kong."

CAUSE
=====

"Hong Kong" is being listed as "Kong Hong."

WORKAROUND
==========

Selecting "Kong Hong" will correctly display the abbreviation "HK" (without the
quotation marks). You can also manually type in "HK" (without the quotation
marks) to work around this problem.
