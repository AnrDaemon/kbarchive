-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Manager does offer the option of Portrait or Landscape in the Print Session
Properties dialog box. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Printing tab.

2. Select the Printer radio button, and then click Printer.

The Print Setup dialog box allows a selection of Portrait or Landscape. No
warning is issued to indicate this is not a supported option for the
Generic/Text Only Printer Driver.

Also, operation with Landscape selected has no effect on output directed to a
printer. However, files produced by directing output to a file will contain no
output and have a file size of zero KB.

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain configurations, print output directed to a file will result in a
file size of zero KB.


CAUSE
=====

The Properties dialog box of the Generic/Text Only Printer Driver does not offer
a Portrait or Landscape setting. The driver supports Portrait only.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, select Portrait in the Print Setup dialog box.
