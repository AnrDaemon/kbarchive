-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the proper Microsoft Windows NT File System (NTFS) access
permissions that are needed for an Internet Information Server (IIS) Web site,
an Internet Information Services (IIS) Web site, or a File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) site to work.

NOTE: When IIS is installed, it creates the proper NTFS access permissions for
the default Web and FTP sites for the anonymous (IUSR_<computer_name>)
and, if applicable, application owner (IWAM_<computer_name>) user
accounts.

If you try to access a Web page that you do not have access to, you may receive
the following error message:

   HTTP Error 401 401.3 Unauthorized: Unauthorized due to ACL on resource.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To properly access and manage IIS, the local System account and local
Administrators group need FULL CONTROL permissions to all drives on the
computer. These permissions can be added from a command prompt. Type the
following commands on each NTFS drive:

   cd \ 
   cacls * /T /E /C /P System:F Administrators:F

NOTE: Modifying permissions may take several minutes per drive, depending on the
amount of data on that drive. If the drive has no files, you receive the
following error message:

   The System cannot find the file specified.

To configure the minimum required NTFS permissions for users who access IIS,
grant the following directory permissions to the anonymous Internet user account
(by default, this is the IUSR_computer_name account) and any other accounts or
groups that need access to the Web server:

   Directory                            Permissions
   ------------------------------------------------
   Content                                READ (RX)

   Winnt                                  READ (RX)

   Winnt\System32                         READ (RX)

   Winnt\System32\Inetsrv                 READ (RX)

   Program Files\Common Files             READ (RX)
   (and all subdirectories)

NOTE: In IIS 3.0, Active Server Pages is an add-on product and is located in its
own folder. For this reason, IIS 3.0 installations that are running ASP require
READ (RX) permissions set on the Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Asp folder.

Content is defined as anything (such as Web pages, images, and files) that
someone can use the Web browser to access. By default, the content folder for
the World Wide Web Publishing Service is \InetPub\Wwwroot, and the content
folder for the FTP Service is \InetPub\Ftproot.

IIS requires both appropriate NTFS permissions and the appropriate user rights to
access the Web server. The following table lists the authentication type and the
corresponding user right that is required to use the specified authentication
type:

    Authentication Type            Required User Right
    -------------------            -------------------
    Anonymous                      Log on locally (Password Synchronization disabled)
    Anonymous                      Access this computer from the network (Password Synchronization enabled)
    Basic (Clear Text)             Log on locally
    NT Challenge Response          Access this computer from the network
    Digest (IIS 5.0 only)          Access this computer from the network
    Integrated (IIS 5.0 only)      Access this computer from the network
