TITLE   :Messenger Messages Are Lost If Desktop at Screen Saver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When your computer receives a Messenger message while the desktop is not the
foreground application (for example, a screen saver is running), the message is
not displayed.

CAUSE
=====

With Microsoft Windows NT, the Messenger service attempts to display a message
box, and, if it fails because of an incorrect desktop, the thread goes to sleep,
and will be displayed after the next desktop switch by Winlogon.

With Terminal Server, Messenger messages are not displayed by the Messenger
service, but a special Terminal Server mechanism is used to display it on the
correct session. But the errors are not tested, so if the messages cannot be
displayed because of a wrong desktop, they are lost.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0, Terminal Server Edition.
