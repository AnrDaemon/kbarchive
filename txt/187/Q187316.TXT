IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click a registry entry (.reg) file, you may receive the
following error message:

   Cannot import <path to file>. Error opening the file. There may be a
   disk or file system error.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if the .reg file is located in a folder whose name
contains spaces.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Move the .reg file to a folder whose name does not contain spaces.

 - Use Registry Editor to modify the way Regedit.exe examines the path. To do
   so, use registry editor to modify the data value for the "(Default)" value in
   the following registry key:

   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\regfile\shell\open\command

   Change the data value to:

   regedit.exe "%1"

   NOTE: Make sure to include the quotation marks. After you make this change,
   quit Registry Editor and restart the computer.
