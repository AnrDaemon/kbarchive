-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector's behavior changed between
Exchange Server version 4.0 and Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5. (In
addition to the behavior change, the connector's name was changed to the
Internet Mail Service.) The text color was set to "auto" for the messages coming
from the Exchange Server version 4.0 Internet Mail Connector, but the text color
is now set to "black" for messages coming from the Exchange Server versions 5.0
and 5.5 Internet Mail Service.

CAUSE
=====

Text-to-RTF and HTML-RTF conversions now force the RTF text to be black instead
of using default Windows colors in Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5.
