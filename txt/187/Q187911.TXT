TITLE   :XCLN: Outlook Template Adds Zeros to Raw Number Field
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::8.03; WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.03, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you create an Outlook template that contains a number field in Raw format,
the template may add a decimal and zeros to the right of the decimal to numbers
that you type in the field. The number of zeros added to the right of the
decimal equals the number of digits to the left of the decimal. For example, if
you type "1111" (without the quotation marks) in the field, "1111.0000" is
actually displayed.

This problem is known to occur when you use the Outlook HTML Form Converter tool
to convert the template to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format, and then use
the HTML version of the template and Microsoft Outlook Web Access to create a
custom contact.

STATUS
======
