TITLE   :Cannot Delete the Testdir.tmp File on a Shared NTFS Volume
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you copy a file or folder to a shared NT File System (NTFS) volume, a
Testdir.tmp file may be created that you do not have permission to delete.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your user account or the group in which you are a
member does not have Delete permissions for the shared NTFS volume.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, add Delete permissions for the shared NTFS volume to
your user account or to the group in which you are a member. To do so, follow
these steps:

NOTE: You must be logged on to the computer as an administrator.

1. In My Computer or Windows NT Explorer, right-click the NTFS volume, and then
   click Properties.

2. On the Security tab, click Permissions.

3. Click the user account or group you want.

4. In the Type Of Access box, click Special File Access.

5. Click the Delete check box to select it, and then click OK.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you copy a file or folder to a shared NTFS volume with Full or special
Delete permissions, the Testdir.tmp file is usually deleted after the file or
folder is copied. If your user account or group does not have Delete permissions
for the NTFS volume, Windows NT is unable to delete the file or folder after it
is copied.
