SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to explain the differences between the four
methods of setting Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) options. The four
methods that can be used to set DHCP options are; Default, Global, Scope, and
Client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a brief description of the four methods that can be used to set
DHCP options:

Default
-------

Setting a default DHCP option modifies the default value for one of the DHCP
options. When a default value is set, the default value becomes the default that
was set during administration rather than the DHCP default that was set during
installation of DHCP. This method may be accessed through DHCP Manager, click
"DHCP Options," then click "Defaults".

Global
------

When you set a global DHCP option, the option takes affect for all DHCP scopes
defined on the selected DHCP server. Global DHCP options appear in DHCP Manager
with a globe icon proceeding them. This method may be accessed through DHCP
Manager, from the DHCP Options menu, click Global.

Scope
-----

Setting a scope DHCP option will set the option only for the Selected scope on
the Options Scope menu. DHCP options configured for a scope are displayed with a
series of computer icons proceeding them in DHCP Manager. This method may be
accessed through DHCP Manager, from the DHCP Options menu, click Scope.

Client
------

This method can be used to configure one or more of the DHCP options for a
specific DHCP client. DHCP options can be set for a client only if the DHCP
client has a reserved IP address(a Reservation). The only way to see if a DHCP
option is set for a DHCP client is to view the properties of an active client
lease through DHCP Manager. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. On the Scope menu, click Active Leases.

2. Select the individual client, click Properties, and then click Options.

   NOTE: If the Options button is not available, no reservation for the client
   exists.

NOTE: If a DHCP option is set by more than one method, precedence is in the
following order:

1. Client Overrides...

2. Scope Overrides...

3. Global Overrides...

4. Default.
