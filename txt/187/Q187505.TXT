======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server versions 1.1, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Index Server, it may take an extremely long time to index
documents, and some documents may appear not to get indexed. Also, the abstract
for documents may be blank or contain incorrect information.

CAUSE
=====

This may be caused by third party software that places a lock on the Web content
that you are attempting to index. Antivirus software programs and any other
software that monitors or scans your Web content for extended periods of time
have been known to cause this problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable any software that may be monitoring the Web
content.
