TITLE   :BackOffice 4.0 Exchange Setup Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Exchange version 5.5 using the BackOffice 4.0
installer, installation fails with the following error:

   Processing file '<drive
   letter>\cd3\exchsrvr\server\setup\i38\server.ins', at or near line 205.
   The directory name is invalid

After closing this box, another error box is displayed stating that the directory
name is invalid. Closing this will give the message that Exchange Setup was
interrupted and did not install successfully.

   Line 205 of the file server.ins states:
   CreateProcess:%windir%\system32:lodctr Eseperf.ini;180000

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the server is in the change user/execute mode. This
does not happen when Exchange is installed in the change user/install mode.

STATUS
======

To work around the problem, install Exchange by going to Control Panel,
Add/Remove programs in All users Mode or open a command prompt and type in
change User/install.
