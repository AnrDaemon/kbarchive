TITLE   :REG.EXE Err Msg: The Operation Could not be Completed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Command-line Registry Manipulation Utility (Reg.exe) may fail with the
following error message:

   The operation could not be completed.

CAUSE
=====

NetBIOS names have a limit of 15 characters. The Command-line Registry
Manipulation Utility fails if the remote computer is 14 or 15 characters because
it considers the two backslashes included as part of the Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) as part of the computer name. For example, Reg.exe successfully
connects to a computer with the name THIRTEENCHARS because it sees the UNC name
as fifteen characters (\\THIRTEENCHARS). However, Reg.exe fails if the computer
name is FIFTEENCHARACTR because it thinks the UNC name is seventeen characters
(\\FIFTEENCHARACTR).

This problem occurs with Reg.exe version 1.04 and earlier.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem on Intel platforms, obtain Reg_x86.exe from the
following Internet location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/i386/

To resolve this problem on Alpha platforms, obtain Reg_axp.exe from the following
Internet location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/alpha/
