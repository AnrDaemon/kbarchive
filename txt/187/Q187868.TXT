TITLE   :XADM: Downloading Messages Using Outlook Express Crashes Store
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Dr. Watson error occurs with the Store.exe process when you are downloading
messages using a POP3 client, such as Outlook Express.

CAUSE
=====

A full-fidelity download of a multipart/alternative type message is failing,
where the text/plain alternative type is a tag without a content- type header,
which causes the crash. The information store does not convert the message
properly when using Outlook Express build 4.72.2106.4(Internet Explorer 4.01).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

This is not an issue using the Outlook 98 client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The issue was resolved by changing the inbound text converter, so that if the
content-type header is missing, the converter sets the media type for the node
to TEXT/PLAIN, so that cvtrLookup does not see a NULL string.
