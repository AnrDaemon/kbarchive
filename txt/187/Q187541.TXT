TITLE   :NWCONV Migration May Change Domain Account Policy
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Use Supervisor Defaults is selected in the Migration Tool for NetWare,
changes made to Domain User Account Policies and the NetWare Compatible
Properties for each specific user become the default user properties in Windows
NT.

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) to migrate users from a
NetWare server to a Windows NT primary domain controller (PDC) may change Domain
Account Policies for users.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the "Use Supervisor Defaults" box is selected on the
Defaults tab of the User and Group Options dialog box. (NOTE: Use Supervisor
Defaults and Migrate NetWare Specific Account Information boxes are selected by
default.)

NOTE: Current user default settings may be reviewed on a NetWare server by
opening the SYSCON utility (NetWare version 3.x), and then, under Supervisor
options, look at the Default Account Balance/Restrictions. (NOTE: NWAdmn3x.exe
is the utility used on NetWare 4.x servers.)


RESOLUTION
==========

If changes to Domain Account Policy are not wanted, click to clear the "Use
Supervisor Defaults" check box before migrating user accounts. Otherwise, prior
to migration, make changes on the NetWare server to equivalent settings in
Windows NT or, after the migration is concluded, verify the Windows NT Account
Policies and make the necessary changes to restore the Account Policies to their
previous settings.
