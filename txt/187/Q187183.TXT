TITLE   :RDP Client Hangs If the Network Is Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When network connectivity is not available and the Microsoft Terminal Server
Client (MSTSC) utility is connected, the computer may stop responding (hang) for
approximately two minutes when you disconnect the MSTSC utility.

CAUSE
=====

The MSTSC utility displays the Connect dialog box and makes a NetServerEnum call
to enumerate the servers. Before the enumeration completes, if you click Cancel
or press ESC, the dialog box disappears. But the MSTSC utility waits for the
NetServerEnum call to complete before terminating its process. This process may
take as long as two minutes. If you wait for the NetServerEnum call to complete
before pressing ESC, the process terminates immediately.

RESOLUTION
==========

The NetServerEnum call is a synchronous call; there is no way to cancel it to
avoid the delay.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
