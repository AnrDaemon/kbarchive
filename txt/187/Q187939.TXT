TITLE   :IPX May Not Work When Packet Size Is Larger Than Receive Buffer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

IPX may not work, or data corruption may occur, with a receive-packet driver
when a token ring packet spans multiple receive buffers. Data corruption is
likely when the Receive buffer size on the client Windows NT computer is smaller
that that of the Maximum transmit size of the Windows NT server computer.

NOTE: The data transfers may seem to work but the data is corrupted if the NDIS
packets are large enough to be split among receive buffers.

The IPX protocol allows packets to span multiple receive buffers, but only token
ring packets are large enough to do so. NDIS 4 token ring drivers, such as
Ibmtrp.sys, that support the ReceivePacket function may encounter this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


You can work around this problem by setting the maximum transmit size on server
computers to equal to or smaller than the receive buffer sizes of client
computers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
