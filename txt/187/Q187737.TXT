TITLE   :PRB: Meta Tag Properties Not Retrieved from a Query
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
 - Indexing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using meta tags as custom properties, you may not be able to retrieve the
value even though you have cached the property and added it to the columns to be
retrieved. You can search for the properties and return results, but the value
of the property is not returned for display.

CAUSE
=====

This may be the result of caching meta properties as a non-string data type.
Index Server 2.0 and and Windows 2000 Indexing Service only support meta tags as
string data.
