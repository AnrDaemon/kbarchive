TITLE   :XCON: Unicode Message with TNEF Causes Information Store to Stop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a Unicode message that contains transport-neutral encapsulation
format (TNEF) information to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, the
information store may stop unexpectedly.

CAUSE
=====

When you send a Unicode message to an Exchange Server computer, the message's
default codepage is set to Unicode. However, if the message contains TNEF
information, non-Unicode text properties may be set on the message. This
inconsistency between the message's codepage and text properties causes the
information store to stop unexpectedly.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
