The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When you are installing connectivity to Lotus Notes from Microsoft Exchange, it
is necessary to install a Notes proxy generator on the Exchange Server computer.
This is done so that mailboxes in Exchange will have a Notes proxy address for
receiving messages addressed from Lotus Notes users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are a few different substitutions that can be used for the Notes proxy
generator. They include the following:

   %s substitute the Surname of the user
   %g substitute the Given name of the user
   %d substitute the Display name of the user
   %m substitute the mailbox name of the user
   %i substitute the initials of the user

In all the substitutions above, spaces and illegal characters are removed from
the field before the substitution is made. To specify a different substitution
to be used, use %r:

   "%r" char1 char2

All instances of char1 are replaced by char2 in the substitutions that occur
after this in the format string. If char1 == char2, the character is deleted.

Also, an ampersand (&) can be used in place of a percentage sign (%) in the
above substitutions.

If the format field is not present, this is equivalent to:

   address-type ":" "%m" "@" domain

Examples:

   These examples are based on:
   mailbox = "FirstLast"
   display name = "First Initial. Last"
   surname = "Last"
   given name = "First"

   Site Proxy                     Generated User Proxy
   ----------------------------  ----------------------------------------
   NOTES:%r _%d@wspu.lotus       NOTES:First_Initial._Last@wspu.lotus
   NOTES:%r..%d@wspu.lotus       NOTES:FirstInitialLast@wspu.lotus
   NOTES:@wspu.lotus             NOTES:FirstLast@wspu.lotus
   NOTES:%s@wspu.lotus           NOTES:First@wspu.lotus

Of the above substitution characters, the %D may need some clarification. The %D
is the case for the display name. Using the example from above, if the display
name is changed to the following:

   display name = "Last, First Initial."

the following proxy generator behavior is displayed:

   Site Proxy                     Generated User Proxy
   ----------------------------  ----------------------------------------
   NOTES:%d@wspu.lotus           NOTES:First Initial. Last@wspu.lotus

The Notes proxy generator does a swap on the display name. The proxy generator
actually reads the display name into a buffer and searches for the first comma
in the string. Any character in the buffer after the comma is considered the
first name, and any character before the comma is considered the last name. To
get the Lotus Notes proxy generator to create a proxy of NOTES:Last First
Initial., the Site Addressing tab must have NOTES:%g %s %i@wspu.lotus.
