TITLE   :Extra ClipArt Preview Files Unavailable for Multiple Users
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When multiple users attempt to access the same file by using the Clip Gallery
tool, they may receive the following error message:

   Clip Gallery cannot open the previews file \\Server\Share\Folder\File
   Name.cag. That file is on a network. The file may have been removed or the
   network server may not be available.

CAUSE
=====

When you set up Microsoft Office 97, Setup does not copy all of the multimedia
files on to the computer. Instead, Clip Gallery references the files in the
original location. These files cannot be shared by multiple users.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid each user from having to connect to the Office 97 server, install the
extra clipart files on the local Windows NT Terminal Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0, Terminal Server Edition.
