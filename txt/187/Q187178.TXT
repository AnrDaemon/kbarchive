TITLE   :Mouse Pointer Location Undetected by RDP Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

 

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is not an accessibility feature. It is a feature added by Intellipoint
Mouse support. To see the behavior, you must have Intellipoint Mouse support
enabled on the Server, but not on the Client. The Terminal Server client sends
keystrokes to the Server because the Client is the active application.
Intellipoint intercepts the CTRL sequence and draws the rings where it thinks
the cursor is located. The cursor is at the edge of the window, because that is
where it is clipped to by the Server.

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Terminal Server client window is in focus and the user moves the mouse
pointer out of the window, the client does not register that the mouse location
is out of range. Instead, it behaves as though the mouse is still in the client
window.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, the user may either:

 - Install Intellipoint Mouse support on the Client, and deconfigure it from the
   Server.

-or-

 - Remove Intellipoint Mouse support from the Server.
