TITLE   :TCP/IP Device Driver Does Not Remember Share Flags
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

TCP/IP device driver does not remember share flags of previous opened endpoints.
Even if the previous endpoint is opened exclusively, another application can
open the same endpoint with share flags and capture all network traffic.

CAUSE
=====

When a port is opened for listening and share flags are specified, the driver
grants access, even if the previous port was opened with exclusive rights (with
share flags set to zero). The driver does not remember the shared flags of the
previous call, and only checks the flags of the new one. The problem is in
TCP/IP, and is applicable to all versions of Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition.
