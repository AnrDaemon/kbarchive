Visual Basic for Applications macros.

The macros in this article turn text boundaries on or off in a Microsoft Word
document while you are in page layout view.

NOTE: To locate the Text Boundaries check box, click Options on the Tools menu,
and then click the View tab.

To turn the Text Boundaries property on and off, use either of the following
macros.

NOTE: These methods also work well with other properties in Visual Basic that
return a value of True or False.

Method 1: Using the Abs Function
--------------------------------

This method uses the Abs function, which specifies the absolute value of a
number, where True equals -1 and False equals 0 (zero):

      Sub ToggleTextBoundaries()
         n = ActiveWindow.View.ShowTextBoundaries
         ActiveWindow.View.ShowTextBoundaries = _
         Abs(ActiveWindow.View.ShowTextBoundaries = -n)
      End Sub

Method 2: Using If Then...Else Statement
----------------------------------------

This method uses the If Then...Else statement:

      Sub ToggleAnyTrueFalseItem
         If ActiveWindow.View.ShowTextBoundaries = True Then
            ActiveWindow.View.ShowTextBoundaries = False
         Else
            ActiveWindow.View.ShowTextBoundaries = True
         End If
      End Sub
