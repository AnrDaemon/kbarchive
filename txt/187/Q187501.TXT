SUMMARY
=======

With Microsoft Index Server 2.0, you can add two types of directory entries to
the catalog. Virtual roots are added when you tell the catalog to index a
specific Web site, and physical paths are added by creating a new directory
entry under the index.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Virtual roots are normally what you add to a catalog to index Web content. They
are added by selecting the Index This Directory entry in the properties of a
folder or virtual folder in the Internet Information Server snap-in.

Physical paths are added by right-clicking the directory folder under the catalog
in the Index Server snap-in and choosing New. Physical paths do not return valid
URLs based on query results, instead they return only physical directory paths.
