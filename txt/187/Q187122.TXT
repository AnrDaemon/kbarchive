TITLE   :Deleted Files Appear Under in Recycler for All SIDs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete files, they may appear in the Recycler folder for every SID.
This is apparent, if you have a File Allocation Table (FAT) partition. Everyone
with a FAT partition sees files that were deleted by other users. This is not
limited to FAT partitions, though (both in the Recycle Bin and in Explorer for
their SID in the Recycler folder). If the administrator deletes some files from
an NTFS partition and then looks at the Recycler folder, the files appear for
every SID.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the case of files deleted from a FAT partition, every user sees every deleted
file, and if a user deletes the file from his or her recycle bin, it is deleted
from all SIDs in the Recycler folder. The administrator can delete every
reference to a file deleted from an NTFS partition by deleting the file once
from anywhere it appears.
