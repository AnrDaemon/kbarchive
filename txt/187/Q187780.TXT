PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5; WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

 - When you are running Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 on Windows NT Server 4.0
   with Service Pack 3, you receive an exception error when a heavy load is
   placed on the local directory.

 - When POP3 clients or SMTP clients initialize sessions with their Microsoft
   Exchange directory, an exception is generated, stating:

   The exception unknown software exception (0XC0000009A) occurred in the
   application at the location 0x77f88C01. Click OK to terminate
   application.

 - If you try to stop the Exchange services, the computer stops responding
   (hangs). You must restart your computer to regain control. On a computer with
   the SMTP or POP3 user capability that is in the process of high user load,
   the system produces the exception mentioned previously.

CAUSE
=====

A Max File Handle Limitation has been reached on this computer. The registry
settings at

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SMTPSRV/Parameters

for the following:

 - Cache entry #

 - Cache table

 - TTL

are insufficient to handle the load.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the

version 3.0 or 4.0 is installed.
