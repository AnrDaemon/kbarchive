TITLE   :XFOR: Problems Running Multiple LinkAge Connectors
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you have more than one Microsoft Exchange LinkAge connector (Exchange Notes
Connector, Exchange SNADS Connector, or Exchange PROFS Connector) running on the
same computer, the connectors may stop transferring messages and the LinkAge
event log file may contain entries similar to the following:

 - LME-PROFS-DIAVM(0157) 4 40982:Finish building NETDATA INMR06 record >>
   netdata(1738)

 - LME-PROFS-DIAVM(0157) 4 23704:NJE client finishes sending >>
   njeclnt(3072)

 - LME-SNADS-MEXDIA(0230) 1 56002:{Table is full}: Could not register polling
   timer for new Exchange messages >> mex2dia(6274)

 - LME-SNADS-MEXDIA(0230) 2 01101:Error {System failure}: The event handler for
   MEXQALARM failed >> evtmgr(490)

CAUSE
=====

When you start a LinkAge connector, an event timer is created using the static
name MEXQALARM. Because a static name is used, only one timer is created when
multiple LinkAge connectors are running on the same computer. This creates a
conflict and prevents the connectors from functioning properly, which may cause
an unusually large number of events to be logged in the LinkAge event manager.
When the space that is allocated for the logging of events in the event manager
becomes full, the above entries appear in the event log file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
