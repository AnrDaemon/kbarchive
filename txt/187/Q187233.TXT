TITLE   :BUG: DateTimePicker's CustomFormat May Be Ignored
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a DataTimePicker control's CustomFormat property set, but when you set
the Format property to dtpCustom, the CustomFormat is not used.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you set a DateTimePicker's Format property to dtpCustom, you must follow
this by assigning the CustomFormat property, even if it already contains a valid
format string. This assignment to CustomFormat may be a new string value or it
may be assigned to itself.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default. From the Projects
   menu, select Components, check "Microsoft Windows Common Controls-2 6.0," and
   click OK.

2. Add two CommandButtons and a DTPicker control to Form1.

3. Enter a custom format into the DTPicker control's CustomFormat property. For
   this example, use 'Today is' MMM d, yyy.

4. Add the following code to the Form's Module:

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
            DTPicker1.Format = dtpCustom
         End Sub

         Private Sub Command2_Click()
            DTPicker1.Format = dtpCustom
            DTPicker1.CustomFormat = DTPicker1.CustomFormat
         End Sub

5. Run the Project and Click Command1. Note that the CustomFormat is not used
   and the date is displayed as a short date.

6. Click Command2 and note that the CustomFormat is used and the date is
   displayed in the form: Today is May 5, 1998.
