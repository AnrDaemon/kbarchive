TITLE   :XWEB: File Attachments in OWA Append 2 Extra Bytes CR/LF
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outlook Web Access to send a message with a file attachment, the
attached file always has two extra characters appended, that is, CR/LF.

CAUSE
=====

The Exupload code missed two hyphens while parsing the HTTP header information.
The delimiter used in computation is "\r\n", as opposed to "\r\n--", ignoring
the double hyphen and resulting in two extra bytes.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access,
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
