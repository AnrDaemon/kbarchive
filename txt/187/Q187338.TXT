IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to your computer, the computer may stop responding
(hang) for 3-5 minutes. When you complete the logon process, your computer
behaves normally.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Compaq Insight Management Desktop Agents For
Windows 95/NT tool (Cpqalert.exe) is running.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To work around this behavior, locate and delete the "Cpqalert.exe" value from the
following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

Note that this workaround disables the Compaq Insight Management Desktop Agents
For Windows 95/NT tool. Contact Compaq Technical Support for information about
an update to this product.
