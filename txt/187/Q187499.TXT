TITLE   :Performance Monitor Counters For IIS Not Available
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Internet Information Server, counters will be added to
Performance Monitor for the Internet Information Services Global, the HTTP
Service, the FTP Service and the Gopher Service. These counters only appear when
the corresponding services are running. These counters will only be available to
administrators.

CAUSE
=====

If the counters for these services do not show under any circumstances, there
maybe a problem with the Performance Monitor counter information files. When
Internet Information Server installs, it will create or modify the Perfc009.dat
and Perfh009.dat files, and create backup files of Perfc009.bak and
Perfh009.bak.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, first make a backup of the Perf*.dat and Perf*.bak
files. Then copy the existing Perf*.bak files to Perf*.dat files. Make sure that
Performance Monitor is not currently accessing these files.

Note: If the Perf*.bak files are corrupt, copy the Perf*.dat and Perf*.bak files
from an existing working system with the same Performance Monitor counters
installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
versions 2.0 and 3.0.
