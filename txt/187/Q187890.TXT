PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbdtacode word8 word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Confirm Data Source dialog box is not displayed when you do either of the
following in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications for Microsoft Word:

 - You set the ConfirmConversions argument to True in the OpenDataSource method.

-or-

 - You use the InsertDatabase method.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word. The Confirm Data Source dialog box
is not exposed (accessible) to the Word Visual Basic object model or Wordbasic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ConfirmConversions argument in the OpenDataSource method has no relationship
to the Select method check box in the Open Data Source dialog box.

When you record a mail merge in Word, and then run the macro, it will run without
displaying any of the dialog boxes you saw during the recording of the macro.
You cannot select a different method for opening the data source without
rewriting or re-recording the macro.
