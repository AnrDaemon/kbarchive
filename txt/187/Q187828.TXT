TITLE   :XADM: Information Store Hangs as Thread CPU Utilization Drops
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The information store appears to stop responding (hang) frequently, for short
periods of time (most periods not exceeding 5-10 minutes).

CAUSE
=====

The information store queries the directory on a particular public folder to
determine permissions on that folder. The directory is using an inefficient
search filter for this operation and, combined with the context the store is
using to call into the directory, the store threads eventually block until the
initial read is completed.

The problem is aggravated (to the extent you see a hang) by the fact that a user
in the access control list (ACL) for the public folder is a member of a large
number of distribution lists (DLs).


RESOLUTION
==========

A change was made to the ds_search call to use a better filter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
