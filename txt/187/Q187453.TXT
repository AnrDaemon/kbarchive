   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

This issue has multiple symptoms including:

 - The user's policy is no longer applied when the user logs on to the server.

 - The system administrator cannot delete the user's profile using the System
   Properties/User Profiles utility because the Delete button is unavailable.

 - The user's SID remains in HKEY/USERS even if the user is not logged on to the
   server.

CAUSE
=====

Programs or services that leave a handle open to the user's registry cause the
unload of the hive not to succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

In Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), select the user's SID and then click Unload
Hive.
