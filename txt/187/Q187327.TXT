TITLE   :Full Synchronization Fails When Using Long Service Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An error message is written to the event log of domain controllers every five
minutes indicating a problem with the domain synchronization. While SAM and
BUILTIN Full synchronization is successful, LSA Full Synchronization fails with
the following system event log entries:

   PDC:
   NETLOGON: 5714
   The full synchronization request from the server "bdc" failed with the
   following error: More data is available.

   BDC:
   NETLOGON: 5718
   The full synchronization replication of the LSA database from the
   primary domain controller "pdc" failed with the following error: More
   data is available.


CAUSE
=====

Replication of the LSA database fails when using long service names. The buffer
size reserved to hold LSA data depends on a maximum name-length variable that
was too small. The problem does not occur in Windows NT 4.0.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
