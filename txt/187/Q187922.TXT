KEYWORDS:kbAutomation kbOSWinNT400 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual Basic 6.0, user-defined types (UDTs) can be arguments or return types
of public properties or methods. Trying to pass or receive a UDT using an
ActiveX EXE (out of process server)on NT 4.0 will fail if Service Pack 4 for NT
4.0 is not installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install Service Pack 4 for NT 4.0.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When running a client application that receives or returns a UDT to an ActiveX
EXE on NT 4.0 without Service Pack 4, one of the following will occur:

 - The ActiveX EXE is running in debug mode in the Visual Basic IDE. When a
   client tries to create the server that is running in the IDE you will receive
   the following error:

   Run-time error '458':
   Variable uses an Automation type not supported in Visual Basic.

   -or-

 - The ActiveX EXE is running as a compiled exe. When a client tries to create
   the server, the client application hangs.
