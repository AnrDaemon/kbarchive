SYMPTOMS
========

When you check the spelling in a document, the spelling checker may not flag
misspelled words that are typed in capital letters (uppercase), or are formatted
in All Caps or Small Caps.

Additionally, if the spelling checker catches a misspelled word that is formatted
with small caps, the words that appear in the Suggestions list are all
uppercase. If you select one of these listed words and click Change, the
spelling checker changes the word to full-size uppercase.

CAUSE
=====

If the Ignore words in UPPERCASE option is selected, Word does not flag
misspelled words that are typed in capital letters, including words that are
formatted as small capital letters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn off the Ignore words in UPPERCASE option. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Select the Spelling and Grammar tab.

3. Under Spelling, click to clear the Ignore words In UPPERCASE check box. Click
   OK.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually correct the misspelled word in the Not in dictionary box of the
Spelling and Grammar dialog box and then select Change.

-or-

After the spelling check is complete, select the unwanted uppercase words and
change them back to lowercase (SHIFT+F3). The small caps format is still
applied.
