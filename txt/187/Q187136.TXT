TITLE   :NetDDE Error Messages During Logon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to Windows Terminal Server using the RDP client, you may receive
the following error message:

   NetDDE Services:

   Another user or machine has the same name as this account on the network.
   Network DDE services will not be available.

CAUSE
=====

This message appears if someone else is logged on with the same user name. The
error message means that Network Dynamic Data Exchange (NetDDE) programs, such
as Microsoft Chat, cannot function because, if someone wants to chat with you,
there is no way to know which user to contact.

RESOLUTION
==========

Log on to each computer with a unique user name.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NetDDE service on Terminal Server registers with the user name instead of
the computer name. This is necessary because all network clients that use the
Terminal Server will have the same computer name.
