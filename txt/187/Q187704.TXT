TITLE   :Server Lockup Receiving Pop-up Messages with Backup Exec
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a pop-up message is received from Backup Exec 7.0 build 719 that is
installed on Windows NT Server 4.0, the access to the CPU is blocked, except for
critical processes necessary to keep the computer running Windows NT running.
Some or all applications may quit responding until the message box is closed.
The server may become completely unresponsive on the network while in this
state.

NOTE: This behavior has only been seen in Backup Exec 7.0 Build 719.

CAUSE
=====

Seagate Technical Support reports that Build 719 of Backup Exec for Windows NT
Server 7.0 makes a change to the registry that causes this behavior. The
registry change is required in order for Backup Exec to work on Small Business
Server (SBS). This change, however, causes problems on Windows NT 4.0 Server. At
this time, the installation program of Build 719 does not check to see if the
version of the OS is Windows NT Server or BackOffice SBS. The registry subkey
changed is:

   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager
   \SubSystems\Windows

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

The entry before installing Backup Exec 7.0 Build 719 is:

   
   %SystemRoot%\system32\csrss.exe ObjectDirectory=\Windows
   SharedSection=1024,3072 Windows=On SubSystemType=Windows
   ServerDll=basesrv,1 ServerDll=winsrv:UserServerDllInitialization,3
   ServerDll=winsrv:ConServerDllInitialization,2 ProfileControl=Off
   MaxRequestThreads=16

The entry after installing Backup Exec 7.0 Build 719 is:

   
   %SystemRoot%\system32\csrss.exe ObjectDirectory=\Windows
   SharedSection=1024,3072,512 Windows=On SubSystemType=Windows
   ServerDll=basesrv,1 ServerDll=winsrv:UserServerDllInitialization,3
   ServerDll=winsrv:ConServerDllInitialization,2 ProfileControl=Off
   MaxRequestThreads

RESOLUTION
==========

On Windows NT Server 4.0, add the "=16" value back to the MaxRequestThreads
section. Do not make this change on Small Business Server.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Build 719 removes the "=16" from MaxRequestThreads=16. Also note that Backup
Exec implements the change indicated in the following article by adding ",512"
after the SharedSection:
