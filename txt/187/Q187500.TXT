TITLE   :Unable to Log On to an Upgraded IIS 3.0/SSL Server
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from Internet Information Server (IIS) version 3.0 to IIS 4.0,
you may be unable to log on to your Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled sites.

CAUSE
=====

The upgrade procedure does not check for keys stored by Setkey.exe. Therefore,
these keys are not available in IIS 4.0 after the upgrade.

NOTE: Setkey.exe and Keygen.exe are designed to work with Internet Information
Server 3.0 only.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

 - Before you upgrade, start the Keyring.exe in IIS 3.0 at least one time and
   commit changes. The SSL key will be stored to the place recognized by the
   upgrade process.

   -or-

 - After you upgrade, reinstall the SSL key using Keyring.exe in IIS 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install an SSL key with Setkey.exe and start the Keyring.exe, you may
receive a pop-up message stating that keys were found. Keep in mind that
Keyring.exe recognizes them but did not install them. Setkey.exe installs the
SSL key to a different location in the registry than Keyring.exe. IIS 3.0 Secure
connections will work fine with keys installed by Setkey.exe and Keyring.exe.
