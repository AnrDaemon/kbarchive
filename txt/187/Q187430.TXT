TITLE   :Client Setup Requires License That Is Already Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Terminal Server Client, the following message will appear
after the Name and Organization Information dialog box:

   Please note that use of this client software requires a valid Windows NT
   Workstation license and Windows NT Server Client Access License, as described
   in the End-User License Agreement for Microsoft Windows NT Server version
   4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This license can be found both in hard copy
   form in the box containing the server software and in electronic form in the
   eula.txt file located in the \i386 and \alpha directories on the CD-ROM.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. The Terminal Server Client Setup does not detect
whether the appropriate licenses are available on Terminal Server. This message
will appear whether or not the licenses exist.

Additional query words: TS client
