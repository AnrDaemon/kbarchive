TITLE   :Messages Sent From TSAdmin Display While Session Is Locked
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The messages sent by the Actions menu of Terminal Server Administration are
always displayed at the recipient's Terminal Server Client station, even if the
client's session has been locked by running Windows NT Security and selecting
Lock Workstation.

This can be a security problem for users who lock their sessions but do not want
the messages sent to them to be seen by anyone else.

RESOLUTION
==========

Users should choose to disconnect their sessions rather than locking their
client session. Messages cannot be sent from the Terminal Server Administration
utility to a disconnected session.
