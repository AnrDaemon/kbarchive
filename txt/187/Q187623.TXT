   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

By default Terminal Server and Windows 2000 Terminal Services uses TCP port 3389
for client connections. Microsoft does not recommend that this value be changed.
However, if it becomes necessary to change this port, follow these instructions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To change the default port for all new connections created on the Terminal
Server:

1. Run Regedt32 and go to this key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal
   Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Find the "PortNumber" subkey and notice the value of 00000D3D, hex for
   (3389). Modify the port number in Hex and save the new value.

   To change the port for a specific connection on the Terminal Server:

    - Run Regedt32 and go to this key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal
   Server\WinStations\<connection>

      NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
      readability.

3. Find the "PortNumber" subkey and notice the value of 00000D3D, hex for
   (3389). Modify the port number in Hex and save the new value.

   NOTE: Because the use of alternate ports has not been fully implemented for
   Terminal Server 4.0, support will be provided as "reasonable effort" only,
   and Microsoft may require you to set the port back to 3389, if any problems
   occur.

To Alter the Port on the Client Side
------------------------------------

1. Open Client Connection Manager.

2. On the File menu, click New Connection, and then create the new connection.
   After running the wizard, you should have a new connection listed there.

3. Making sure that the new connection is highlighted, on the File menu, click
   Export. Save it as <name>.cns.

4. Edit the .cns file using Notepad changing "Server Port=3389" to "Server
   Port=<xxxx>" where <xxxx> is the new port that you specified on
   Terminal Server.

5. Now import the file back into Client Connection Manager. You may be prompted
   to overwrite the current one, if it has the same name. Go ahead and overwrite
   it. You now have a client that has the correct port settings to match your
   change Terminal Server settings.

NOTE: The Terminal Server ActiveX client listens on TCP port 3389 and this cannot
be changed. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client that is available in
Microsoft Windows XP and Windows .NET (version 5.1 and later) has this ability.


NOTE: You must restart the Terminal Server before the new listening port becomes
active, or recreate the RDP listener via Terminal Services configuration.
