TITLE   :FTP Server Fails to Respond If First Binding Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Multihomed FTP server fails to respond to simple commands like DIR or GET.

CAUSE
=====

If an Internet Information Server FTP server is running on a computer with two
network interface cards and the first interface is not available (connection
broken, for example). You will only get the normal status line from the FTP
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Outgoing FTP traffic goes out the first entry in the route table to that
network. On a multihomed computer on the same IP network, all outbound traffic
will exit on the card that has the first entry in the route table. If you change
the IP address of that card, it will change the location in the route table.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

With this fix, FTP makes back connections using the source IP address that the
client connected to. This fixes problems with firewalls and any device that is
expecting this behavior.
