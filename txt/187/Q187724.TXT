 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Invoking the WLList or WLText Properties sheet from within an ActiveX Control
(OLE Control) and changing the Appearance property causes a ghost image of the
control to appear within the Properties window. Also, a windows-type icon
appears within the Windows Task Bar after invoking the Task Bar with the ALT+TAB
keys.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add an ActiveX Control (OLE Control) to the form.

2. Add the WLList control, version 6.0 to the OLE container.

3. Right-click the OLE Container and choose WLList Properties.

4. In the List Properties dialog box, change the Appearance property to 0-wlFlat
   and then click Apply.

5. Note that a ghost image of the control appears inside the Properties dialog
   box. Click OK.

6. Press the ALT+TAB keys to cycle through the running applications. A
   Windows-type icon appears on the Task bar. However, no description appears
   after you select the icon. To make the icon disappear, choose the Visual
   FoxPro icon and press the ALT+TAB keys to move to the next icon, then use the
   ALT+TAB keys to cycle through the remaining running applications again.
