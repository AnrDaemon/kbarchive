PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - MSN Companion, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The customer asks: "What happens if the device is left unplugged for an extended
period of time?"

CAUSE
=====

Customer leaves MSN Companion unplugged for an extended period of time.

RESOLUTION
==========

 - Some customers need to unplug appliances for extended periods of time while
   traveling. Customers who do this may need to be reminded of the following
   non-critical issues when they return:

 - New e-mail received accumulates and remains in the inbox. If an inbox reaches
   maximum capacity, new messages take precedence and older messages are
   deleted.

 - While out of town, customers can check e-mail remotely by accessing Hotmail
   through another terminal.

 - The device could go into an automatic upgrade after extended periods of
   non-use. The upgrade with be either "mandatory" (one that customers will have
   to complete before using MSN Companion again) or "non-mandatory" (one in
   which customers can click "cancel" and then connect without upgrading).
