SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server 2.0 (SMS) provides several methods that you can use to
install the SMS client software onto computers. In one method, you use Microsoft
Windows NT Remote Client Installation in conjunction with Network Discovery to
install client software on computers that are running Microsoft Windows 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Windows NT Terminal Server clients are present on the network in which the
Windows NT Remote Client Installation is being used, and if those Terminal
Server clients are operating in Application Server mode, you may experience
problems when you install the SMS client software by using Windows NT Remote
Client Installation.

Windows NT Remote Client Installation does not configure Terminal Server clients
for Installation mode prior to installing the SMS client software. For this
reason, you should not use Windows NT Remote Client Installation to install the
SMS client software on clients that are running Terminal Server in Application
Server mode. In this situation, you should install the SMS client software onto
the Terminal Server clients prior to initiating Windows NT Remote Client
Installation.

To install the SMS client software onto Terminal Server clients, follow these
steps:

1. From a command prompt, type "change user /install" (without the quotation
   marks) to place the Terminal Server client in Install mode.

2. Run Smsman.exe, or SMS Login script to install the SMS client software.

3. After the SMSMAN wizard or the login script completes, in Control Panel,
   double-click the Systems Management icon, click Components, and then note the
   progress of the installation. Continue to click Refresh occasionally until
   all of the components that you configured are installed successfully.

4. From a command prompt, type "change user /execute" (without the quotation
   marks) to place the Terminal Server client back in Application Server mode.
