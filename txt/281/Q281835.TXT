SYMPTOMS
========

On the Internet Mail tab of the Internet Mail Service properties, if you click

   then click Advanced Options. Change the Message Text Word Wrap setting from
   Never to At Column with a value of 300, and then click OK twice to accept the
   change.

2. Restart the Internet Mail Service.

3. Open the Internet Mail Service properties, click the Internet Mail tab, and
   then click Advanced Options. Change the Message Text Word Wrap setting back
   to Never. Click OK twice to accept the change.
