TITLE   :PRB: Session Variables Do Not Persist When Global.asa Is Empty
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbASP kbWebServer kbDSupport kbiis400 kbiis500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your application contains an empty (0 byte) Global.asa file, session
variables may not be maintained as you browse from page to page in your
application.

CAUSE
=====

Because Internet Information Server (IIS) tries to parse Global.asa to determine
whether there is a Session_OnStart subroutine to process, if Global.asa is
empty, IIS fails when it tries to parse the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, open Global.asa in Notepad, press the SPACEBAR, and
then save the changes. In addition, you can delete Global.asa.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In IIS, create a virtual folder, and make it an application. To make the
   virtual folder an application, perform the following steps:

   a. In the IIS Management Console, right-click the virtual folder, and then
      click Properties.

   b. On the Virtual Directory tab, in the Application Settings list box, click
      Create.

   c. Click OK. The icon for the virtual folder should change from a folder icon
      to an application icon (a box that contains a globe).

2. Add Global.asa, and make sure that it is completely empty.

3. Add an Active Server Pages (ASP) page named Page1.asp, and then paste the
   following code:

     <% session("test") = "value" %>
     <a href="page2.asp">Page 2</a>

4. Add another ASP page named Page2.asp, and then paste the following code:

     <% Response.Write session("test") %>

5. Browse to the first page, and then browse to the second page. The value that
   is stored in session("test") is not persisted.
