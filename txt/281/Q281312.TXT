======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to list the groups a user belongs to by using
NetUserGetLocalGroups, it may not work, and may generate a 1722 error. A service
that is running under a local-user context (for example, a local account on a
Windows NT Workstation-based computer) may call NetUserGetLocalGroups to list
groups a domain user belongs to. If this user has a local group that contains a
global group from a trusted domain, the Application Programming Interface (API)
does not work when multiple network providers are installed on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

The user-mode API tries to connect to the domain controller (DC) from the
trusted domain whose global group is stored in the user's local group. This
connection does not work, and generates a STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE. The API then
connects by using a null account. The problem happens when multiple providers
(redirectors) are installed. The STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE error becomes masked
(overwritten) by the error that is received by the next provider,
STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME. The error code with the highest precedence is returned
to the API. Under these conditions, because both of these error codes were
unlisted, the last one is passed on to the API.
