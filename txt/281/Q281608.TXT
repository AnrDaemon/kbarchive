SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to paste a picture that you copy from a Web site into Microsoft
Encarta Researcher, the picture may appear as a blank or gray box.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs due to the design of the Web site. The blank or gray box
may actually be a table that has a background color. JavaScript code places the
image inside a table, so that when you copy the image, only the table is copied,
but not the image inside the table.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no known work around for this behavior. This method of formatting
pictures on a Web site is sometimes used to prevent the reuse of images that are
covered by copyright or other agreements.
