TITLE   :XADM: "A Fatal Error (0x8004011d) Occurred" Event ID 11
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server

SUMMARY
=======

In a mixed Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server and Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
environment, the following event ID message may logged in the Application log by
the Microsoft Exchange Event service on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer:

   Event ID: 11
   Source: MSExchangeES
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description:
   A fatal error (0x8004011d) occurred in an IExchangeEventSink while processing
   message [Subject = "test message"].

This event occurs after an Exchange 2000 user modifies an event script on an
Exchange Server 5.5 public folder. If an Exchange Server 5.5 user modifies the
same script, the script functions correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The value 8004011d from the Description box of this event ID message maps to the
MAPI error MAPI_E_FAILONEPROVIDER. This error code indicates that the provider
could not log on. However, this is not a fatal error. In this scenario, the
credentials are not correct and the user is not prompted with a dialog box
because this error runs in the context of a service instead of interactively.

When the Event service is triggered to run the event script, the Event service
tries to impersonate the user who most recently modified that event script. When
an Exchange 2000 user has been the most recent to modify the script, the Event
service tries to log on as that user. However, because the Exchange Server 5.5
service account does not have access rights to the Exchange 2000 user's mailbox
the log on attempt is denied. The script cannot run and the event ID message
indicated in the "Summary" section is logged.

In Exchange Server 5.5 the service account has inherited permissions to every
mailbox. Therefore, when an Exchange Server 5.5 user is the last user to modify
the event script, the Event service has the correct permissions with which to
log on in that user's context. However, in Exchange 2000, there is no service
account that has permissions to all mailboxes.

To resolve this behavior, grant the Exchange Server 5.5 service account rights to
the user who is modifying the scripts. This permits the Event service the
ability to log on as the Exchange 2000 user to run the script.
