MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior:

1. Paste the following ASP script into an ASP file and name it Post.asp:
   <%
    for each Item in Request.Form
      Response.Write("Name: " & Item & " -- ")
      Response.Write("Value: " & Request.Form(Item))
      Response.Write("<br>")
    Next
   %>
   <FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="post.asp" id=form1 name=form1>
    <INPUT type="submit" value="Submit" id=submit1 name=submit1>
    <INPUT type="text" id=CBGero (with umlaut) name=CBGero (with umlaut) value=192>
   </FORM>

2. Browse to the page, type "195" (without the quotation marks) in the text box
   to the right of the Submit button, and then click Submit.

The return is "Name: CBGero (with umlaut) -- Value:" instead of "Name: CBGero (with umlaut) -- Value: 195".
