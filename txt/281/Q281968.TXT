======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you set the sound scheme to "No Sounds," the system may search for the
"Close.wav" file on Application Close Events. If you have any network shares
mapped as a local system drive or have a network share path in the system
"PATH," and you are running programs or open windows from these network shares,
on system shut down, the system closes these open programs or windows. When the
system searches for the "Close.wav" file on a network share when you shut down
your computer, you may receive a STOP 0x50 error message.


CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because when you set the sound scheme to "No Sounds," the
system does not handle this setting correctly. When the system searches for the
Close.wav file on network shares when you shut down your computer, a code bug in
the Mup.sys file can cause a STOP 0x50 error messag.
