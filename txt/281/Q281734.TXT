TITLE   :XFOR: Message Sent Time Stamp Off by One Hour After Migrating
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you migrate a user from Lotus cc:Mail to Exchange Server 5.5, the "message
sent" time stamp may be incorrect by one hour on some messages.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you perform the migration after the switch to daylight
saving time. Daylight saving time is taken into account even if the message was
sent while the area was still in standard time.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

version 5.5 Service Pack 4.

date and the date of the message that is being manipulated.
