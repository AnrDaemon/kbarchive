When you try to install Internet Explorer 5, you may receive the following error
message:

   Setup was unable to download the required components. Please make sure you
   are connected to the Internet, or try to run Setup again later.

CAUSE

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to locate the
ProgramFilesDir value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

On the Edit menu, click String, type "C:\Program Files" (without the quotation
marks). Note that if Windows NT is installed on a partition other the drive C,
substitute the appropriate drive letter. Click OK, and then quit Registry
Editor.
