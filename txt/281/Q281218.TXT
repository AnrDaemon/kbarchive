TITLE   :XADM: LoadSim Error Message: STG_E_FILENOTFOUND
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the Initialize Test phase of LoadSim Setup, the
following error message is displayed:

   OLE: STGOPENSTORAGE (Ups1k.msg): Error: STG_E_FILENOTFOUND

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the current simulation file points to the wrong path.
The simulation (.sim) file is saved when you quit the LoadSim tool. This file is
automatically reloaded when you restart LoadSim.

LoadSim is installed into C:\Program Files\Load Simulator, by default. If the
.sim file is saved in a different folder, when you restart LoadSim, the .sim
file that was previously used is reloaded, but it is unable to find any of the
.msg files. This behavior occurs because the .sim file references the .msg files
with relative paths, and assumes that the .msg files are in the same folder as
the .sim file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, verify that the .sim file that you are using is in the
same folder as the .msg files that LoadSim installs.
