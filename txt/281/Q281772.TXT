TITLE   :Simple Maps Are Not Mapped Correctly for User Group Mappings
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, versions 1.0, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Services for Unix Administration utility has an option to configure the User
Name Mapping service. On the MAPS tab, you can enable the display of simple maps
for users or groups. If you select Groups, the simple maps are displayed.
However, if you create an advanced mapping for a group, the simple group maps
are no longer displayed. Even though the Service for Unix Administration tool in
the graphical user interface did not show the simple group maps, the
Mapadmin.exe command-line utility still displays the simple maps.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because a logic error removes the simple maps if an advanced
map exists.
