KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Reader, version 1.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the activation process for Microsoft Reader, you may receive the
following error message:

   Activation Error

When you click OK, the activation process stops.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are logged on to a network domain that uses
either the Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system, and
you do not have the proper access rights to the registry.

Activation requires write-access to write a registry key. If your registry access
is limited, the proper registry key cannot be written.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, have your network administrator temporarily change your
user rights to allow registry access for the activation process. After the
activation process is completed, the administrator can return your regular user
access rights.
