-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you fly an aircraft in Virtual Cockpit view, and you press L to turn on the
cockpit lighting, the light on the panel may flash on and off.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the "Effects quality" slider in Microsoft Combat
Flight Simulator 2 is configured incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, move the "Effects quality" slider to the High position:

1. Click Options, and then click Settings.

2. Click Advanced settings.

3. Click Image Quality.

4. Move the "Effects quality" slider all the way to the right (the High
   position).

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Virtual Cockpit view and the cockpit lighting feature require high-end video
hardware to be displayed properly.

You may need 16 to 32 megabytes (MB) of dedicated video memory to set the
"Effects quality" slider to High while you are using the Virtual Cockpit view
with cockpit lighting.
