When you use the type-ahead searching features of the DBCombo control from
DBList32.ocx, the SelectedItem property is not updated, and DBCombo does not
reflect the matching entry that is found.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Visual Studio service pack that contains this fix.

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select an item in the list portion of a DBCombo control, the
SelectedItem property contains a bookmark that you can use to reposition the
selected record in the Recordset of the Data control that the RowSource property
specifies. This property should be updated whether the user uses a mouse or the
keyboard to select the item. Thus, when you use the type-ahead searching feature
of this control, you expect that the SelectedItem property is updated after you
type a name that matches a name in the list and press the ENTER key. In
addition, the text in DBCombo should reflect the matching entry that is found.
However, this functionality does not work when you use the standard Databound
Combo and the Intrinsic Data control that shipped with Visual Basic 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, click Components, select the "Data Bound List Controls
   6.0" check box, and then click OK.

3. Add a Databound combo, DBCombo1, to Form1.

4. Add two TextBox controls, Text1 and Text2.

5. Add a Data control, Data1.

6. Configure the property settings of these controls as follows:

   Data1 - Data control
   DatabaseName = Biblio.mdb
   RowSource = Authors
   ReadOnly = True

   Text2 - TextBox control
   DataSource = Data1
   DataField = Author
   Visible = False

   DBCombo1 - Databound Combo control
   RowSource = Data1
   ListField = Author

7. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Private Const UP_ARROW = 38
   Private Const DOWN_ARROW = 40
       
   Private Sub Data1_Reposition()
      '
      ' Copy Text from Bound Text2 to Unbound Text1.
      Text1.Text = Text2.Text
   End Sub
       
   Private Sub DBCombo1_KeyUp(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
      Dim bmk As Variant
      Dim x As Integer
      Dim msg As String

      On Error GoTo ErrHandler
      '
      ' Save Bookmark on CR and Arrow Key Activity.
      Select Case KeyCode
         Case Asc(vbCr), UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW
             msg = "DBCombo1.SelectedItem has the value "
             bmk = DBCombo1.SelectedItem
             ' The next line raises error 13 if bmk has no value.
             For x = 0 To UBound(bmk)
                 msg = msg & bmk(x)
             Next x
             Data1.Recordset.Bookmark = bmk
             Debug.Print msg
      End Select
      Exit Sub
               
   ErrHandler:
      If Err.Number = 13 Then   ' Type mismatch
         Debug.Print "DBCombo1.SelectedItem is not assigned a value."
      Else
         MsgBox "Error " & Err.Number & ": " & Err.Description, vbCritical _
            + vbOKOnly
      End If
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
      Text1.Text = ""
      DBCombo1.Text = ""
   End Sub

8. Run the project, and type a name that matches an entry in the bound DBCombo
   control (such as "Curry, Dave" (without the quotation marks)).

9. Press ENTER. Notice that the DBCombo1.SelectedItem property is not updated.

10. Clear the text in DBCombo, and type a name that matches an entry in the list
   (such as "Wellin, Paul" (without the quotation marks)).

11. Press the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key. Notice that DBCombo1.SelectedItem is
   updated with the bookmark for "Wellin, Paul".
