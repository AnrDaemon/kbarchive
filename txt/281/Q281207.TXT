TITLE   :SMS: Manual Upgrds (1.2 to 2.0 SP2) Cause 2.0 SP3 Upgrd to Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade an existing Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 secondary site
to SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) by running the Setup.exe program from the
CD-ROM, and then selecting the "Upgrade an existing SMS Server" option, any
future attempts to upgrade to Service Pack 3 (SP3) by using the Administrator
Console do not work.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because during the original upgrade from SMS 1.2 to SMS 2.0
SP2, whether or not the Microsoft Network Monitor tool (NetMon) is installed, a
NetMon directory structure exists. When you attempt to upgrade by using the SMS
Administrator Console, the entire package is sent to the secondary site. During
the installation, you receive the following error message:

   Cannot copy C:\IUSH4YZ5.TMP\SMSSETUP\netmon\i386\parsers\atalk.dll to
   x:\sms\netmon\i386\parsers\atalk.dll, Win32 error = 3

"Error = 3" indicates that the specified path cannot be found, because the file
is not present on the secondary site.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually run the upgrade from either the SP2, or
SP3 CD-ROM directly on the secondary site. By running the SP2, or SP3 CD-ROM
directly on the site server, and not through the Administrator Console of the
parent site, this allows the secondary site server to accept future upgrades
from parent sites.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
