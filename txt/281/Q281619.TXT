======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 End-User Client is removed from a
computer that is running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 by
clicking the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel, the following files are
left in the %WINDIR%\System folder:

 - Winsli.dll
 - Winsli32.dll
 - Luastr32.dll
 - Winrui.dll
 - Winrui32.dll
 - Csvstr32.dll
 - Wincsv.dll
 - Wincsv32.dll
 - Wcpic32.dll
 - Wincpic.dll
 - Appcst32.dll
 - Wappc32.dll
 - Winapcc.dll
 - Winmgt32.dll
 - Snadump.dll
 - Snareg.dll
 - Snatrcsn.dll
 - Dmodappc.dll
 - Snatrc.dll
 - Snadmod.dll
 - Snakrnl.dll
 - Snaclm.dll
 - Snacnw.dll
 - Snacbv.dll
 - Snacip.dll
 - fmistr32.dll
 - Vstapi.dll
 - Snancp.dll
 - Bvnsst.dll
 - Ibbcast.dll
 - Lmbcast.dll
 - Snasap32.dll
 - Snands32.dll
 - Adloc.dll
 - Snanls.dll
 - *.nls

This problem does not occur if the HIS 2000 End-User Client is installed on a
computer that is running Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional or Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, because these files are not installed in the
%WINDIR%\System folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The files listed in the "Symptoms" section can be deleted manually after the HIS
2000 End-User Client is removed.

The Windows 95 or Windows 98 Client for SNA Server 4.0 does not function
correctly if it is installed after the HIS 2000 End-User Client is removed,
unless these files are deleted manually prior to installing the SNA Server
client.
