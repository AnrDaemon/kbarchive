Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual Fox Pro, create a program.

2. Add the following code to the program:

   SET SAFETY OFF
   SET COLLATE TO "General"
   CREATE TABLE test (nID N(5))
   FOR T=1 TO 10000
   	INSERT INTO test VALUE (T)
   ENDFOR
   SELECT * FROM test WHERE nID NOT IN (SELECT * FROM test)
   SET SAFETY ON
   ? RECCOUNT()
   CLOSE ALL
   DELETE FILE test.DBF

3. Run the program file.

Note that the SQL-SELECT statement and RECCOUNT() function return 24 records,
when no records should be returned.
