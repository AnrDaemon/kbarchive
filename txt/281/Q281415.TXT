PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsUtil kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Performance Monitor objects may be missing
after you perform one of the following tasks:

 - A site reset

 - You apply SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2)

 - You change SQL or SMS account passwords with the Administrator tool


The missing performance objects may include SMS Discovery Data Manager, SMS
Inventory Data Loader, and SMS Software Inventory Processor. The remaining
objects are listed but may provide inaccurate data.


CAUSE
=====

As SMS performance objects are reinstalled, some objects' indices change.
Programs that cache performance object indices cannot view performance objects
until the cache is refreshed with the new indices.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue:

1. Stop the following SMS services on the site server:

   SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER
   SMS_EXECUTIVE
   SMS_SQL_MONITOR
   SMS_NT_LOGON_DISCOVERY_AGENT
   Windows Management
   SMS_LICENSE_SERVER

2. Stop any local or remote Performance Monitor tools that are accessing
   performance data on the site server. When all performance objects are
   released, the full eight SMS performance objects will be displayed.

3. Restart the SMS services by starting the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service.
   This restarts all services automatically.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
