----------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 63, in the second to last paragraph, please remove the following
statement:

"... or you can install it into one Administrative group and then use the
services mode of the Active Directory Sites and Services MMC snap-in to move
servers between Administrative groups. You can't do this in the Exchange System
MMC snap-in."

Exchange 2000 Server.

Directory Sites and Services MMC.
