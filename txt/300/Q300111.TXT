TITLE   :Error Message: Unknown Partner Error at Passport Login Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::1.3,1.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse to the Passport Login server, you may receive the following
error message:

   Unknown Partner Error

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the wrong version of the Partner.xml file is installed on
the Web server.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Check the URL at the logon page to see which Passport environment you are
   hitting. The list below shows the different Passport environments and their
   corresponding logon URLs:

    - Beta Preproduction

   http://next-login.passporttest.com/login.asp

    - Preproduction

   http://current-login.passporttest.com/login.asp

    - Production

   http://login.passport.com/login.asp

If the URL does not match the environment that your site is using, send e-mail to
the following address and request the Partner.xml file for the environment that
you are using:

   nfssup@microsoft.com

2. When you receive the new Partner.xml file, copy it into the folder where the
   existing Partner.xml file is located and choose to overwrite the existing
   file when you are prompted. The Partner.xml file is usually located in the
   \WINNT\System32\MicrosoftPassport\ folder.

3. After the Partner.xml file is replaced, you must restart the IIS service. Use
   the following commands at a command prompt to stop and then restart the IIS
   service:

   "net stop iisadmin /y" (without the quotation marks)

   "net start w3svc /y" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: In some rare cases, it may be necessary to shut down the server computer
completely and restart it.
