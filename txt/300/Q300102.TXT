SUMMARY
=======

Installing the Passport encryption key and Site ID on a computer that does not
fall into the domain that is provided when you registered results in the site
not working correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All validation of cobranding, routing, and encryption is based on the Site ID
and return URL that your code passes to the Passport network servers. The same
configuration information can be installed on several computers that are part of
the same cluster or farm, and thus are intended to act as if they were a single
server.

The key installation program that is used to install the Passport keys must be
run individually on each server that hosts Passport Manager. This is because the
key is actually locally encrypted into the server's registry, and one of the
elements that is used for encryption and decryption is the Media Access Control
(MAC) address that is obtained specifically from the primary network card of the
server. Merely copying the Passport registry node from one server to another is
not sufficient and results in an unreadable key on the destination server.
