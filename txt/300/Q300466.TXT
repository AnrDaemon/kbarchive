TITLE   :FP: Clicking Reset on Search Results Page Does Not Clear Form
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 2002 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Reset button on a search page, the Search for text box is
cleared. When you click the Reset button on a search results page, nothing
happens.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the initial value of the text box on the search
form is set to the current search value. According to the FrontPage
specification, the search component sets the initial value on the search results
page to the search text. Therefore, when you click the Reset button, the search
text remains in the text box on the search results page.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you can reset the search form using Dynamic HTML
(DHTML). For additional information about how to do this, click the article

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) specification, the Reset
button in an HTML form is supposed to set the value displayed in a text box back
to its initial value.
