TITLE   :One Customer's Profile Apparently Viewable by Another Customer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER::1.3,1.4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible for one customer's profile data to be viewed by another customer.

CAUSE
=====

This is usually the result of an improperly configured proxy server and is not a
Passport problem. This may occur if two users within the same proxy view pages
that contain Passport or other private data without the server properly causing
the content to expire or qualifying the Cache-control or Pragma: no-cache
directives that are sent to a proxy server in the header. For more details and
ways to fix this problem, see the following Passport Software Development Kit
(SDK) Web site:
