SUMMARY
=======

It may be necessary at times to rebuild the index of the MSDN Library. This
article shows how to do so.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are some of the reasons you might want to rebuild the MSDN Library index:

 - There is slow performance while searching for documents.

 - There is slow performance at startup.

 - When starting the MSDN Library there are no entries under the Index tab.

 - The index file is corrupt.

For information on resolving other problems with the MSDN Library, see the
"References" section of this article.

Steps to Resolve Problem Behavior
---------------------------------

1. Search your local hard drives for a "*.chs" file for the problematic MSDN.
   For example, April 2001 might be in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
   Studio\MSDN\2001JAN\1033 and be named MSDN100.chs.

2. Rename the file so the extension is .old. For example, "MSDN100.old" (without
   the quotation marks).

3. Start the MSDN Library and click the Index tab.

   The Index will be rebuilt and the MSDN Library should function as designed.

NOTE: If the Index tab was selected when the MSDN Library was last closed, the
Index will rebuild during startup of the Library. This process may be slow, and
the system may appear to stop responding ("hang").
