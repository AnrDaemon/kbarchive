======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4

SYMPTOMS
========

When Netscape Navigator browsers are redirected to the Passport network pages,
you may receive the following error message:

   404 Page Not Found

CAUSE
=====

If your site is experiencing this problem with the Netscape Navigator browsers
only, it is probably the result of a misplaced or missing CSS cobranding style
sheet, cobranding template, or an element called by your cobranding.

RESOLUTION

Make sure that a CSS style sheet is available using the path and file name you
supplied for the CoBrandCSSURL and that the cobranding template is available
from the URL you supplied for CoBrandURL at site registration time.
