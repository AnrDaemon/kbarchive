You are not able to view the sample Passport Web site pages, or the Passport Web
site pages do not work correctly after you install the Passport Software
Development Kit (SDK).

RESOLUTION

1. Make sure that your server meets the hardware requirements and that your
   server is running the correct software.

following Microsoft Passport Web site:

3. Ensure that you choose a Passport SDK installation option that includes the
   sample Web site pages. Options such as Production may not install the sample
   sites.
