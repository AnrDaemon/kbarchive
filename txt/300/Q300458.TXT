TITLE   :XFOR: Full Reload Modifying Trust Value on Exported Containers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you modify the "Trust level" value on the Exported Containers tab in
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, a full export will take place on
the next scheduled reload. This behavior may be unexpected and cause a
larger-than-normal replication process.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. At the command prompt, type the following

   <drive letter>:\exchsrvr\CONNECT\Exchconn>LSDXA -P CONTROL-SERVICE
   -N LME-NOTES,GWISE or SNADS-DXA -C EXCHCONN.INI /W0

   to produce the Eab.txt file in the following directory:

   Exchsrvr\connect\exchconn\temp

   Note that this process may take a very long time.

2. Change the first line of the Eab.txt file from "Load" to "Updates" (without
   the quotation marks).

   If you do not make this change, all entries not listed in the intermediate
   file will be deleted.

3. Remove all of the entries that are already in the foreign system.

   Each entry starts with a "U" or an "A."

4. Run the following command line to "read" the entries into the foreign
   directory system:

   <drive letter>:\exchsrvr\CONNECT\Exchconn>LSDXA -P CONTROL-SERVICE
   -N LME-NOTES,GWISE or SNADS-DXA -C EXCHCONN.INI /R1

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
