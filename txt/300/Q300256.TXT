======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a connection is made to a mainframe through the 3270 Applet installed on
Microsoft Terminal Server or Terminal Services, the 3270 display screen may show
only a series of dots instead of letters and numbers. If you enter log on
information, you may be able to successfully log on, but the screen may still
show only a series of dots.

CAUSE
=====

When the 3270 Applet is initialized, it attempts to dynamically create the
Lucida TrueType header file, Ltype.fot. If the Ltype.fot file is not present on
the server and write access is not enabled to the Fonts folder, the problem may
occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually install the Lucida TrueType font in the Fonts folder on the computer
that is running Terminal Server or Terminal Services and set Ltype.fot to
read-only.

To work around this problem, enable write access to the Fonts folder.
