SUMMARY
=======

Some versions of Netscape Navigator have an issue that causes cross-site sign-in
or registration posts to fail when certain proxies are used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

 - In Microsoft Windows NT, Navigator 4.0 fails from non-Secure Sockets Layer
   (SSL) to SSL and from SSL to SSL. Version 4.04 and later browsers do not have
   this problem.

 - In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98, Navigator 3.04 fails from non-SSL to
   SSL and from SSL to SSL. Version 4.0 and later browsers do not have this
   problem.

 - Navigator 3 users are specifically blocked from using the Passport express
   purchase service because their information cannot be kept secure if used
   through a proxy.
