TITLE   :Countries Missing from List in the IIS Certificate Wizard
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWin2000PreSP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Geographical Information in the IIS Certificate Wizard, the entries for
Cayman Islands (KY), Grenada (GD), and San Marino (SM) are missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use a different tool (such as the Web client that
is installed with Certificate Services) for the enrollment process.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you select Allow Private Key to be exported.

After the keyset is bound to the certificate, it can be exported as a Personal
Information Exchange (.pfx) file (PKCS#12) and imported on the Web server using
the certificate snap-in.




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Information
Services 5.0.

This problem is scheduled to be fixed in Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.
