TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Console Problems with High Compression
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Systems Management Server (SMS) Remote Control tool with a
Microsoft Windows 2000-based or Microsoft Windows XP-based client computer, the
Administrator console component of the Remote Control (Remote.exe) session may
intermittently stop responding (hang). If Dr. Watson is configured as the
default debugger, a crash log is generated because of an exception in
Remote.exe. This problem occurs only on computer that use the Accelerated Screen
Transfer feature in combination with the High (LZ) compression method.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

   Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

 - Disable LZ compression in the Remote Tools Client Agent properties by
   clicking Low (RLE) as the default compression method for Remote Control.

 - Force existing clients to re-evaluate the compression method that is used by
   running the Hardware Munger tool. You can do this by reinstalling the Remote
   Control client component on all computers, by repairing the component on
   individual affected computers, or by using Rchwcfg.exe to manually run
   Hardware Munger on individual client computers.

The RLE compression algorithm requires less CPU overhead and in most cases
improves performance over the LZ algorithm for the Remote Control tool.

For more information about compression settings, Hardware Munger, or other
configuration options for the Remote Tools client agent, see Chapter 9 of the
SMS Resource Guide.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.
