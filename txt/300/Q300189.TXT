TITLE   :PRB: Paradox ISAM Does Not Support Some Paradox 4.x Types
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::3.51,3.6,5.0,6.0,6.0 SP3,6.0 SP4,6.0 SP5

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0, 6.0 SP3, 6.0 SP4, 6.0 SP5 
 - The DAO SDK, versions 3.51, 3.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Jet versions 3.51 and 4.0 provide a Paradox ISAM driver that allows
access to Paradox 4.x tables. However, the Paradox ISAM driver does not support
the BINARY BLOB (type B) Paradox 4.x data type. Thus, fields that use this data
type will not be available in Visual Basic.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you try to open a Data Access Objects (DAO) recordset against Paradox 4.x
table that contains a field that has an unsupported data type, that field will
be ignored. The field will not appear in the fields collection of any DAO object
(TableDef, Table, dynaset, or snapshot).

NOTE: Although DAO does not recognize or work with Paradox BINARY BLOB fields,
DAO does recognize and work with Paradox OLE BLOB fields.
