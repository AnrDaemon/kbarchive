SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a key certificate in Key Manager under Internet
Information Server (IIS) 4.0, you may receive the following error message:

   "Unable to install the certificate because the security package could not be
   loaded. Please contact your system administrator and ask to have your
   security installation inspected.
   SChannel error = 80090305"

CAUSE
=====

The Schannel.dll entry is missing from the SecurityProviders key in the
registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Browse to the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders

3. In the right pane, select the SecurityProviders value.

4. On the Edit menu, click String.

NOTE: The String menu selection is unavailable unless a value is selected in the
right pane.

5. A text box that contains the current dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are
   associated with Security Providers appears. Click the end of the string, then
   type ", schannel.dll" (without the quotation marks) at the end of the string
   and click OK.

NOTE: Be sure to type the comma (,)and the space before you type schannel.dll to
separate the new DLL in the comma delimited string.

6. Quit Registry Editor.
