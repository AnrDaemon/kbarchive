======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Error property of the Passport Manager object identifies errors or problem
conditions when the user reaches a Passport-enabled Web page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Error property of the Passport Manager object returns an integer value set
by the Passport domain authority during user-network communications. Reading the
Error property determines whether a user's request contains a Passport error on
the query string or in the Passport Ticket cookie.

If you know what area of your Passport implementation code may be failing, place
code that reads the Error property either before or after the code that you
suspect. The syntax, error codes, and descriptions can be found in the reference
page for the Error property at the following Passport Software Development Kit
(SDK) Web site:

   Error
   http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/reference/scriptreference/ifaces/ipassportmanager/error.htm

The information there should assist in resolving the issue.
