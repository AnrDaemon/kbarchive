SYMPTOMS

When you run the ExMerge utility on an Exchange Server computer, you may receive
any of the following error messages:

   ExMerge.exe - Ordinal Not Found

   The ordinal 6601 could not be located in the dynamic link library MFC42.DLL.

   -or-

   ExMerge.exe - Unable To Locate DLL

   EXMERGE.EXE cannot run on this version of your operating system. The program
   requires Windows 2000 or higher to run.

   -or-

   ExMerge.exe - Ordinal Not Found

   The ordinal 6883 could not be located in the dynamic link library MFC42.DLL.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you try to run ExMerge version 6.0.x on a computer that
is running Windows NT 4.0. This version of ExMerge requires that you use
Microsoft Windows 2000.

NOTE: The last error message listed in the "Symptoms" section has a different
cause. You may receive that error message if the version of the Mfc42.dll file
on the local computer is out of date. Versions 2.60 and later of ExMerge uses an
updated version of the Mfc42.dll file. The version of the updated .dll must be
6.00 or later.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, obtain a previous version of the ExMerge utility that you
can use with Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ExMerge utility 6.0.x requires that you use Windows 2000 as your operating
system; however, you can run this utility against either Exchange Server 5.5 or
Exchange 2000 databases.
