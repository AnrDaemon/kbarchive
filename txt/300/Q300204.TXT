TITLE   :XFOR: Messages Sent Through cc:Mail Connector Are White and Blue
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you send messages by using a newly configured Microsoft Exchange Connector
for Lotus cc:Mail, when the messages are received on the cc:Mail end, the
message is written in white text and displayed on a blue background. This issue
occurs even if the message body colors are not set to these colors on the
cc:Mail post offices where the mailboxes reside.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install a new cc:Mail post office, you can set the default colors for
the message body. If the downstream cc:Mail post offices have been configured
for black text and white background, and if the default message body colors have
not been set in the cc:Mail post office that the Connector for cc:Mail connects
to, all messages that pass through this post office are written in white text
and displayed on a blue background. This issue occurs regardless of the setting
on the downstream post offices, and even if there are no users on the post
office that are connected to Exchange Server.
