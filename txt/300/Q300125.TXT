SUMMARY
=======

The Passport Manager object supports a verbose mode, which can be used for
debugging and troubleshooting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When verbose mode is enabled, many of the internal Passport events, methods,
variables, and properties are written to a text log file. The log can then be
viewed to retrace the path of success that the object has completed. Check this
path of success against your code to help you in finding the part of the process
that is not functioning completely.

You can enable verbose mode by running the Passport Manager Administration
utility and selecting the Verbose Mode check box. View the Passport Manager
verbose mode log to trace the methods and properties that are called and set
during Passport Manager object operations.

Methods of a Passport Manager object log an "enter" event. The logged event
includes the values that are passed to the method in the log. When the internal
method finishes, an "exit" event is logged and includes the results of the
method call in the log as well.

Property calls of a Passport Manager object log the event with the property call
result.
