SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to test the Passport sign-in and sign-out process
when your site is in test mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your site is in test mode and a user has chosen to save their Passport
password, the Passport cookies that are written in the test site's domain are
not deleted, and a sign-out check-mark image is not displayed on the Passport
server logout page.

When you test browser behavior with a test site installation, you may
occasionally need to quit the browser to reproduce a new Passport sign-in.
