TITLE   :XFOR: Domains Removed from Message Filtering List Are Turfed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you remove domains from the Message Filtering list, the domains may continue
to be placed in the TurfDir folder, and messages may not be delivered.

CAUSE
=====

Typically, the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service relies on a registry
entry or the Internet Mail Service properties to access the TurfDir folder.
However, when you click the Message Filtering button on the Connections tab in
the Internet Mail Service properties, you can enter domains or users that you
want to block delivery from. This information is passed to the information
store. If you add a domain, and then restart the Internet Mail Service, the new
domains are added to the TurfDir folder (they are "turfed"). When you remove
domains, the information store is not updated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the Services tool in Control Panel to stop the
Microsoft Exchange Information Store service, and then restart it.
