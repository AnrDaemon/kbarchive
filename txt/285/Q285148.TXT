TITLE   :Event ID 637 Is Logged Stating that a User Removed Another User
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool kbWinNTsearch

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Audit feature of account management is enabled, an administrator may
receive an event ID 637 message stating that a user removed another user from a
group even though the user has not removed any users.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur whenever the user views the group even in situations
where the user is only viewing the group, not deleting any other users.

If a member of a group had been previously deleted, and then a user uses the User
Manager tool (Usrmgr.exe) to only view the group, the tool shows that users have
been deleted.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
