TITLE   :BUG: MaxLength Property Is Ignored When Alignment Is Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCtrl kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MaxLength property of a TextBox control is set at design time, and the
Alignment property of the control is changed at run time, the MaxLength value is
ignored.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, reset and assign the MaxLength property at run
time. See the code sample in the "More Information" section.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add a TextBox control to Form1.

3. Set the MaxLength property of the TextBox control to 1.

4. Paste the following code into the code window of Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Text1.Text = ""
       Text1.Alignment = 1
   ' To work around this bug, uncomment the following two lines of code.
   '    Text1.MaxLength = 0
   '    Text1.MaxLength = 1
   End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the program.

6. Type multiple characters in the TextBox control, and notice that the
   MaxLength property is ignored.

NOTE: This bug does not occur in Visual Basic 5.0 because the Alignment property
is read-only at run time.
