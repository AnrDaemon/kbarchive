SUMMARY
=======

When you run hardware inventory on a client computer that is running Systems
Management Server (SMS) 2.0, network traffic may be generated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During a hardware inventory cycle, the SMS-based client collects information
based on classes that are enabled in the Sms_def.mof file. To collect the
requested information, the client may have to access network resources. The
following classes are known to cause network traffic by the SMS-based client
during a hardware inventory cycle:

 - Win32_UserAccount

 - Win32_Group

 - Win32_SystemAccount

 - Win32_NetworkLogonProfile

 - Win32_Desktop

 - Win32_BootConfiguration

 - Win32_Environment

 - Win32_ProgramGroup

 - Win32_PrinterConfiguration

 - Win32_LogicalDisk

 - SMS_LogicalDisk

 - SMS_Printer

Most of this network traffic travels through named pipes to the appropriate
resources such as domain controllers and printers.
