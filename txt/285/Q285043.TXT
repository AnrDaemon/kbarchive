TITLE   :Combat Flight Simulator 2: Unable to Change Gunsight
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbimu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you assign a keyboard key, or game controller button to the "Select
gunsight" action in the Assignments list, the assigned key or button does not
change the gunsight.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Combat Flight Simulator 2 does not have an alternate
gunsight.

You may only use the default "reflector" gunsight, and not the "gyro" gunsight.
