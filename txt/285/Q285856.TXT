KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbhis2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer that is running Host Integration Server, the SnaBase Service logs
the following event whenever a client/server or Distributed Link Service
connection fails due to security violations:

   Event ID: 705
   Source: SNA Base Service
   Description: Logon Failed.
   EXPLANATION
   Access denied on client-server or Distributed Link Service connection
   request.

   Unknown user name or bad password from client UNKNOWN --- Error Code : 4097

   ACTION
   Contact your network support personnel.

CAUSE
=====

Host Integration Server 2000 incorrectly logs the client computer name as
"UNKNOWN" for all instances of this event. The event should reflect the actual
computer name of the client system. UNKNOWN should only be used if the actual
machine name cannot be determined.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.
