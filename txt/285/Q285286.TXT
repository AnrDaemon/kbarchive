TITLE   :Cannot Access IIS Metabase Through IIS Admin Objects
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access the Internet Information Services (IIS) metabase through
the IIS Admin objects programatically in an ASP page, IIS returns the following
error message to the client browser:

   Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a0046'
   Permission denied: 'GetObject'
   /filename.asp, line xxx

CAUSE
=====

For security reasons, access to the metabase (and subsequently the IIS Admin
Objects) is restricted to members of the local Administrators group.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use an authentication technique such as basic, digest, Windows, or certificate
mapping, and make sure that the account in question has access to the metabase
(that is, the account is a member of the local Administrators group).

Under no circumstances should you add any user account to the local
Administrator's group in an attempt to work around this issue. Doing so leads to
major security vulnerabilities.
