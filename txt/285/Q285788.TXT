-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On the Mailbox Resource tab in the private information store properties,
Internet Mail Services may contain a large number in the "total K" column.
However, if you view the Mailbox Resources container under Private Information
Store, Internet Mail Services has 0 in the "total k" column.

CAUSE
=====

When Admin.exe needs to display the mailbox size for the connector's mailbox, a
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) property PR_EMAIL_ADDRESS is
used to obtain the mailbox name. This problem can occur if the mailbox is an
Internet Mail Service mailbox; Admin.exe ignores the size of the mailbox because
the size is a useless number. Unfortunately, the PR_EMAIL_ADDRESS property is
not included (by default) when constructing the query property array, so
Admin.exe does not realize that the mailbox is a connector mailbox and displays
the mailbox's size.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the "Full mailbox Directory Name" column to the
display header.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
