PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server

KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbsna400sp3 kbsna400sp4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using SNA Server's OLE DB Provider for DB2 to transfer more than
32,763 rows of data between Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2 for MVS, the
following error may occur:

   Error at Destination for Row number 32764.
   Errors encountered so far in this task:1
   Conversational protocol error.
   SQLSTATE : HY000
   SQLCODE : -343

CAUSE
=====

As the OLE DB Provider for DB2 transfers data, it increments a correlator ID for
each element in a chain. If the correlator ID reaches 0X7FFF, DB2 for MVS
returns a protocol violation error when the correlator ID is incremented to the
next value of 0X8000. The OLE DB Provider for DB2 returns the error noted in the
"Symptoms" section.
