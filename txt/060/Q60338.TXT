TITLE   :PRB: Unable to Set CodeView Breakpoint on Desired Line

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft CodeView for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In CodeView, an attempt to set a breakpoint on a specified line fails.

CAUSE
=====

The compiler command line did not specify both the /Od and /Zi option switches.
Some compiler optimizations concatenate code in the executable file unless the
command line specifies /Od to disable all optimizations.

RESOLUTION
==========

Recompile the code with the correct options specified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The code example below demonstrates this problem. When the code is compiled with
only the /Zi switch, you cannot set a breakpoint on the indicated line.

Sample Code
-----------

   /*
    * Compile options needed: /Zi
    */ 

   #include <stdio.h>

   int func();

   void main(void)
   {
      int a, b, c;

      a = func();  // You cannot set a breakpoint on this line because
                   // the default optimization concatenates it with the
                   // following line to form the expression:
                   //    b = (a = func()) + c
      b = a + c;
   }

   int func()
   {
      return(10);
   }
