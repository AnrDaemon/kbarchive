SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word, you can select only contiguous text and graphics. That is, to
select a block of text or a combination of text and graphics, the selected items
must be directly above or below one another.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By design, you can only copy contiguous items in Microsoft Word for Windows.
However, Microsoft Word provides a feature that allows you to copy
non-contiguous information. This feature is called the Spike. To use the Spike,
follow these steps:

 - To cut a selection to the Spike, press CTRL+F3.

   NOTE: This actually creates the AutoText entry called Spike.

 - To paste the Spike contents into a document clearing the Spike AutoText
   entry, press CTRL+SHIFT+F3.

 - To paste the Spike contents into a document without clearing the Spike
   AutoText entry, type the word SPIKE and then press F3.
