SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows version 3.0 Setup program adds a /y parameter to an
existing MOUSE.SYS line (in the CONFIG.SYS file) in the event that a Video Seven
graphics card is installed in the machine. With this parameter, the mouse cursor
appears as a block in MS-DOS-based applications. If the parameter is removed,
the cursor becomes a "sprite" or graphics-oriented cursor.

If the parameter is removed and you press ALT+TAB to exit an MS-DOS application,
there will be two mice cursors, one frozen and one active, when you return to
the MS-DOS application. By design, the /y parameter prevents this problem from
occurring and maintains a block cursor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the /y switch with the Microsoft Mouse driver version 7.04 may prevent the
following error message from appearing when starting a non-Windows application
in a window:

   You cannot run this Application while other high-resolution Graphical
   Applications are running full screen. The Application will be suspended until
   a low-resolution or text application is running full screen. Check the PIF
   settings to ensure they are correct.
