SUMMARY
=======

Using the HyperCard Software Development Kit (SDK) for Microsoft Mail, you can
obtain a list of all recipients of a particular mail message. This can be done
as follows:

1. Use the getMessageList command to obtain a list of all messages for the
   currently logged on user.

   The first field returned in the message list is the 4-character message type
   for each message (for example, "Mess").

   The second field returned in the message list is the ID number of each
   message.

2. Use the getMessage command, with the message type and ID as the first and
   second arguments, to obtain the message reference number.

3. Use the getRecipients command, with the message reference number as an
   argument, to obtain a list of all recipients of that message.

The getRecipients command returns a list of recipients, with one name per line.
Carbon-copy recipient's names have a Cc: in front of them. Blind carbon-copy
recipients are not returned by this or any other command in the HyperCard SDK or
Microsoft Mail.
