SUMMARY
=======

When you send the TAB (@A@y) and BACKTAB (@A@z) keys to the 3270 presentation
space using the SEND KEY function, the cursor location doesn't return to the
expected position. These keystrokes are WORD TAB and WORD BACKTAB, which are
special IBM OS/2 Extended Edition Communication Manager compatible HLLAPI
keystrokes. These commands are intended to move the cursor to the next word,
independent of field positioning.

The OS/2 keyboard mnemonics that should be used to TAB and BACKTAB between
unprotected fields are:

   Tab      @T
   Backtab  @B

A complete list of valid OS/2 keyboard mnemonics for HLLAPI SEND KEY (Function 3)
can be found in the "DCA/Microsoft Select HLLAPI Programmer's Guide."
