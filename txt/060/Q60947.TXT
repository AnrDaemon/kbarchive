SUMMARY
=======

Text fields in a Microsoft Mail custom form may be resized upon compiling if the
Lock Text attribute for that field is not set to ON. The Form Designer compiler
has a preset line height to which all editable text fields must conform. If they
do not, the compiler will resize them automatically.

Please note that this information applies only to those text fields that are
"editable" (that is, fields that have the Lock Text attribute OFF). To lock the
text in any field, select the field, choose Field Info from the Objects menu,
and set the Lock Text attribute to ON by clicking the check box. Fields that are
locked will not be resized.
