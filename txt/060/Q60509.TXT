The information in this article applies to:

 - DCA/Microsoft Communications Server, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

DCA/Microsoft Communications Server requires Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.00
or later to operate. The Communications Server MS-DOS and OS/2 clients use named
pipe connections to communicate with OS/2-based Communications Server computers.
These named pipe connections are handled transparently to the user as well as to
the HLLAPI or APPC application programmer.

The following information describes how many named pipes are used by
Communications Server clients when communicating to a server:

1. All 3270 traffic that flows between a client computer and a server is
   multiplexed through one named pipe connection.

2. All APPC traffic that flows between a client computer and a server is
   multiplexed through one named pipe connection.

3. If 3270 and APPC traffic is occurring between one client computer and one
   server, two named pipes are used (one for 3270 traffic and one for APPC
   traffic).

4. If a client computer has 3270 sessions active with two different servers, two
   named pipes are used (one named pipe for each server). This is also true for
   APPC. Please note that 3270 and APPC traffic is never multiplexed through the
   same named pipe to a server.
