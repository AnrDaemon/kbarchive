SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS PRINT.COM utility does not print binary files properly. It expands
tab characters to the appropriate number of space characters, and terminates
when it encounters the EOF (CTRL+Z) character.

The PRINT utility was designed to print TEXT files. It has been suggested that we
add a command-line switch to allow PRINT to print binary files untranslated. The
OS/2 PRINT utility has such a switch, /B.
