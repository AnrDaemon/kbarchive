SUMMARY
=======

In Flight Simulator Versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Step Turns lesson (under
Option W, "See more lessons") in Flight Instruction mode, the airspeed indicator
is above the maneuvering speed during instruction control. This leads the
student to bank steeper than the instructor demonstrated.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
