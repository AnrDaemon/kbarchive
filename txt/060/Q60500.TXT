The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article discusses how to a compile that is in progress when using the
Programmer's WorkBench (PWB).

 - Under MS-DOS (or the OS/2 3.x compatibility box), use CTRL+C to abort.

 - Under OS/2, use "Arg Meta Compile" to abort a compilation taking place in the
   background.

   The default keystrokes for Arg Meta Compile are ALT+A F9 CTRL+F3.

 - You can also create a macro and assign it to a key to abort the compile
   process. Below is a sample macro that you could place in your TOOLS.INI file
   under the [pwb] tag.

      [pwb]
      Abort:=Arg Meta Compile
      Abort:Ctrl+F5

NOTE: In either OS/2 or MS-DOS, the ESC key will not abort a compilation.
