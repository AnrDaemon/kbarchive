The information in this article applies to:

 - DCA/Microsoft Communications Server, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You cannot disable the error message dialog boxes generated by a
Communications Server workstation or server. All severity level 12 and 16
errors are designed to generate error messages. The purpose of these
messages is to provide a visible indicator to the user or administrator
that a severe or critical error has occurred, so that the user or
administrator can take corrective action.

The following is additional information:

1. If the ESC key isn't pressed, error message dialog boxes are designed to
   disappear automatically after 60 seconds. Messages will not stack up on the
   server.

2. All Communications Server error messages are recorded in an error log file.
   (The default filename is COM.ERR. It is located in the LOGS sub-directory).

3. Communications Server messages cannot be redirected to another machine. Link
   or connection related errors are displayed on the machine that supports the
   link. If a connection is activated remotely and a link activation error
   occurs, the remote user will be notified that the connection could not be
   activated, and an error message will appear on the machine that supports the
   link service (on the machine that has the communications adapter).

4. For connection activation errors (that is, there is link problems when the
   connection is defined to be activated initially), only the first connection
   activation failure will be displayed as an error message. If an administrator
   attempts to reactivate the connection and another error occurs, another
   message will appear.

5. Currently, all severity level 12 and 16 errors are defined to be severe or
   critical errors. If you feel that a certain situation should not generate an
   error message, it should be reported to your Communications Server support
   personnel. When this situation has been reported to Microsoft, it will be
   reviewed, and the change request will be considered for inclusion in a future
   release of the product.
