PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have multiple Directory Tree windows open in File Manager. When you close
one that is minimized (by choosing Close from the Control menu), the keyboard no
longer functions in the window that has the focus (that is, the window that is
selected). You can use the keyboard to access the Control menus (ALT+SPACEBAR or
ALT+HYPHEN), but you cannot use the keyboard to select a different directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either use your mouse or choose Help About by
pressing ALT+H, A. Choose the OK button, and you again have keyboard control in
the active Directory Tree window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can identify where the keyboard focus is by looking for a marquee around the
section bar (highlight bar), as follows:

1. In File Manager, open only one directory by choosing Open from the File menu.

2. Minimize that directory by pressing ALT+HYPHEN, N.

3. Press F6 to switch the keyboard focus on the directory icon.

4. Close the icon without restoring it by pressing CTRL+F4.

You now can use the keyboard to select different directories.
