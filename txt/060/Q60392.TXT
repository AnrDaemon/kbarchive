TITLE   :FIX: [PWB] Tag Missing in PWB 1.0 Sample Init File, TOOLS.PRE
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.0; OS/2:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

TOOLS.PRE is a sample Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) initialization file that is
installed (and modified) when C 6.0 is installed by running the Setup program.
On pages 19 and 20 of "Microsoft C: Installing and Using the Professional
Development System," it states that the contents of TOOLS.PRE can be merged with
an existing TOOLS.INI file, if one exists, or it can be renamed to TOOLS.INI, if
there isn't one. To work correctly, you must make sure that the contents of this
file are preceded by a PWB tag (for example, [PWB]) because the supplied
TOOLS.PRE lacks this tag.

RESOLUTION
==========

When merging the PWB 1.0 TOOLS.PRE file into an existing TOOLS.INI file, a [PWB]
tag should be added just above the area where the file is merged. For example:

[PWB]
  .
  .
  .
  (TOOLS.PRE contents)
  .
  .
  .

[NEXT-TAG]

If TOOLS.PRE is being renamed to TOOLS.INI, the tag should be added as the first
line in the file. In either case, failure to add the tag will result in PWB
ignoring the initialization information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB version 1.0. This problem
was corrected in PWB version 1.1.
