SUMMARY
=======

In Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Traffic Pattern lesson
(under Option W, See More Lessons) in Flight Instruction mode, the instructor
asks the student to do a landing check. Ideally, the instructor should verify
that the carburetor heat has been turned on.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
