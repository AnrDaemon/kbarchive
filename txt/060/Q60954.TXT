SUMMARY
=======

In Flight Simulator versions 3.00 and 4.00, during the Takeoff Roll lesson in
the Flight Instruction mode, the instructor does not look to the right for
incoming traffic before entering the active runway. Ideally, the instructor
should do a 360 on the taxiway looking for traffic out the front window of the
plane before entering the runway.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
