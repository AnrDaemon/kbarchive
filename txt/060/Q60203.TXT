SUMMARY
=======

The MODE command cannot change the parallel port identified by PRN. At boot
time, PRN is internally configured by MS-DOS to direct any communication with
the PRN device to LPT1. In other words, PRN cannot be configured to communicate
with any parallel port other than LPT1 using MS-DOS commands. For instance, the
following command is sometimes mistaken as being able to associate a given
parallel port with PRN:

   MODE LPTn

The letter "n" specifies the parallel device number of 1, 2, or 3. The above
command merely cancels redirection from a parallel port to a COM port.

There are various public domain utilities that switch the address specifications
for LPT1 and LPT2, giving the impression that PRN is communicating with another
parallel device.
