SUMMARY
=======

The following information applies to custom forms created with the HyperCard
Form Designer for Microsoft Mail:

   Pressing RETURN while in a scrolling field that has the AutoTab attribute
   enabled will not move the cursor to the next line.

When AutoTab is enabled, pressing RETURN with the insertion point in the last
line of a scrolling field moves the insertion point to the next field on that
card by sending the "tabKey" message to the current card. Consequently, this
disables RETURN for anything but the last line of the scrolling field.

To enable or disable the AutoTab attribute, select the field in question, choose
Field Info from the Objects menu, and select the AutoTab option.

NOTE: Any changes made to a custom form take effect only if the card is
recompiled and then reinstalled on the Mail server.
