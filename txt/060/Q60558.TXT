SUMMARY
=======

The IBM PS/2 Model 25 computer has a video card built in. Different video cards
are available. The video card is identified by a number on the front left bottom
of the monitor right above the serial number.

For example:

   25-001  Identifies a black and white system that can display
           16 different shades of gray.

   25-004  Identifies a CGA version that can produce colors.

To run Flight Simulator version 3.00 or 4.00 in color with the 25-004 display,
you must select video option "C. RGB Monitor (CGA)" when starting the program.
If option "A. Color Composite Monitor (CGA)" is selected, only black and white
will be available on the screen.

Microsoft has not tested Flight Simulator with the IBM PS/2 25-004, and
therefore, cannot guarantee proper results.
