The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using Microsoft MS-DOS Packaged Product Versions 3.x, 4.x, and 5.0, you can
capture data from a communications port to a file by using any of the following
commands:

   COPY COMn: /A <file>
   COPY COMn: <file> /A
   COPY COMn: <file>

An end-of-file (EOF) character (CTRL+Z or ASCII 26) is used to mark the end of
the file. The file will have a terminating EOF character only if you use the /A
switch of the COPY command.

If you use the /B switch for the COPY command, the message "Cannot do binary
reads from a device" is displayed, and COPY terminates.

While the file is being transmitted, spurious characters may be captured before
the start of the data stream, due to the asynchronous nature of the COPY
command. It is your responsibility to ensure that the data is checked for
usability.
