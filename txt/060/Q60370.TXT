TITLE   :Experimental Jet Accelerates Without Throttle

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Using the default value for the Experimental Jet in Flight Simulator Version
4.00b reportedly causes the plane to accelerate down the runway when the
throttle is set to zero. Decreasing the power, increasing the weight, or
applying the brakes will stop the Experimental Jet from moving down the runway.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

Additional query words: fs4 4.0b
