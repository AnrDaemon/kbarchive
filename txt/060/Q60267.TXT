TITLE   :FIX: Error A2057 With DOS.INC, .386, and MASM 5.1 or 5.1a
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1,5.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.1 and 5.1a generate the
following error when the DOS.INC include file is used in conjunction with the
.386 or .386P directive.

   error A2057: Illegal size of operand

RESOLUTION
==========

No errors occur if the USE16 use type is used in the SEGMENT statement. This
generates a 16-bit offset for the DOS.INC macros, whereas a 32-bit offset is
generated without the USE16, and produces an error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 5.1 and 5.1a. This
problem was corrected in MASM version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DOS.INC files are provided on disk 2 of the MASM version 5.1 disks, for
simplified use of the DOS calls.

The following assembly listing produces the error mentioned above:

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   .386
   INCLUDE dos.inc

   _datas  SEGMENT word 'data'     ; add USE16 for a work-around
   msg     DB      'Hi,there'
   msglen  EQU     $-msg
   _datas  ENDS

           ASSUME  cs:_codes
   _codes  SEGMENT word 'code'
   start:  MOV     ax, _datas
           MOV     ds, ax          ; set ds to point to message

           @write  msg, msglen     ; error A2057 occurs here
           @exit

   _codes  ENDS

   END start
