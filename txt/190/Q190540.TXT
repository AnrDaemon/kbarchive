DOCUMENT:Q190540  10-FEB-1999  [foxpro]
TITLE   :FIX: SELECT-SQL with Subselects in WHERE Clause Stops VFP
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute a SELECT-SQL statement, which uses a subquery, when the SELECT
executes, Visual FoxPro exits with an Access Violation (under Windows NT) or an
Invalid Page Fault (Windows 95).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

NOTE: The following causes Visual FoxPro to exit, and you could lose unsaved
data.

Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

   CREATE CURSOR cc (KEYF N(1), inr N(3), DATE d)
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 234, DATE())
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 252, DATE()+1)
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 45, DATE()+2)
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 40, DATE() - 2)
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 50, DATE() - 2)
   SELECT MAX(inr) AS mx, MIN(inr) AS mn FROM cc INTO CURSOR q1
   SELECT v1.DATE, v1.inr, ;

   v2.DATE, v2.inr, ;
   v1.DATE - v2.DATE AS days, ;
   v1.inr - v2.inr AS net ;
   FROM cc v1, cc v2 ;
   WHERE v1.inr = (SELECT mx FROM q1);
   AND v2.inr = (SELECT mn FROM q1)

Under Windows NT 4.0, Visual FoxPro terminates on the SELECT statement with an
error like the following:

   vfp.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address 0x0044817c

Under Windows 95, Visual FoxPro terminates on the SELECT statement with an error
like the following:

   VFP caused an invalid page fault in module VFP.EXE at 0137:00440940.

The address (either the 0x0044817c or 0137:00440940 in the preceding example)
will vary with the specific Visual FoxPro 5.0x build number.

The error does not occur in Visual FoxPro 3.0x and one record is returned.

Workaround
----------

Adding the IN clause prevents the error from occurring. Here is a possible work
around for this problem:

   CREATE CURSOR cc (KEYF N(1), inr N(3), DATE d)
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 234, DATE())
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 252, DATE()+1)
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 45, DATE()+2)
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 40, DATE() - 2)
   INSERT INTO cc VALUES (1, 50, DATE() - 2)
   SELECT MAX(inr) AS mx, MIN(inr) AS mn FROM cc INTO CURSOR q1
   SELECT v1.DATE, v1.inr, ;

     v2.DATE, v2.inr, ;
     v1.DATE - v2.DATE AS days, ;
     v1.inr - v2.inr AS net ;
     FROM cc v1, cc v2 ;
     WHERE v1.inr IN (SELECT mx FROM q1);
     AND v2.inr IN (SELECT mn FROM q1)
