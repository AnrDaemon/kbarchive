SUMMARY
=======

When repackaging cabinet files (.CAB) using the batch program located in the
Support directory, you can encounter errors when installing the application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to package an application for
distribution, the PDW creates a Support subdirectory in the directory used by
the PDW to package the application. This subdirectory contains a batch file
named after the main application EXE. For example, if the application is named
MyApp.Exe, then the batch file will be named MyApp.bat. This batch file can be
run to recreate the cabinet files (.CAB) created by the PDW.

Once the .CAB files have been created, you may need to open the Setup.lst file
for the application to reflect the correct number of .CAB files created. The
Setup.lst file is located one directory up from the batch file, in the main
directory created by the PDW. You can view this text file in Notepad.exe or any
text editor.

To ensure the PDW knows of the existence of all .CAB files, locate the following
line in the [BootStrap] section:

      Cabs=#

where # is the number of .CAB files necessary to distribute the application.

If this entry does not exist or is not the correct number, add or modify the
entry to reflect the correct number of .CAB files.
