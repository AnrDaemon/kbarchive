TITLE   :FIX: VC Debugger Fails for WINCE App if Total DLLs Exceed Four
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbDebug kbVC500 kbOSWinCE200bug kbOSWinCE210fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual C++ Debugger fails to start when a Windows CE application uses more
than four DLLs with debug information. When you start the Debugger with Debug GO
(F5), F10, or F11, the following type of error message appears for the .exe file
and each of the DLLs:

   The project '<Host project path >\myapp.exe' does not match the
   corresponding file on the remote machine.

After clicking all of the OK buttons, the debugger starts in unknown assembly
code with no call stack information. You have to select Stop debugging from the
Debug menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to debug your application and the DLLs, keep the number of DLLs
containing debug information to less than five.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in the Microsoft Windows
CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Create a simple Windows application or use the Generic sample. Add to this
application, your DLL projects one at a time. Build the application and the DLLs
with debug information. The Debugger works fine up to four DLLs. After you add
the fifth DLL, the symptom described above occurs.

The application might run properly outside the debugger in the Handheld PC device
if there is no other coding problem. Outside the debugger, the number of DLLs
you can add to your application is dependent on the available program memory in
the Handheld PC.
