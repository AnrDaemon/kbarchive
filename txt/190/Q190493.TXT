KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbAppSetup kbInternet kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport kbVS600sp4fix kbV

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running a setup program generated by the Visual Basic Package and
Deployment Wizard (PDW), a "Locate File" error message is displayed.

This typically occurs when navigating to a URL that invokes an Internet Component
Download. For example, navigating to an ActiveX Document or Web page containing
an ActiveX control packaged with the PDW.

CAUSE
=====

The setup program may be unpacking a .CAB file that has another .CAB file inside
of it, also known as a "nested" CAB file. The Internet Component Download INF
syntax generated by the PDW does not support nested CAB files; therefore, an
error message prompts the user for the location of the file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the next service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.
