TITLE   :PRB: Component Gallery - Installed ActiveX Controls Refresh
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Component Gallery includes an ActiveX Catalog. This is a dynamic catalog
containing either a list of all registered ActiveX Controls or a list of all
ActiveX Controls selected in the Visual FoxPro Options dialog box. After
selecting some controls in the Options dialog box, and refreshing this item in
the Component Gallery, the newly selected ActiveX Controls do not appear in the
list of installed ActiveX Controls.

CAUSE
=====

The Set As Default button was not selected in the Options dialog box after
selecting the ActiveX Controls. When the Component Gallery refreshes the list,
it reads the registry for the list of ActiveX Controls that were selected in the
Options dialog box. The selections that are made in the Options dialog are not
written to the registry until the Set As Default button is selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

When selecting ActiveX Controls in the Options dialog box, click the Set As
Default button before refreshing the ActiveX Control catalog in the Component
Gallery.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION

4. Open the Component Gallery.

5. Right-click the ActiveX Catalog/Controls/Installed Controls item and choose
