SUMMARY
=======

Administrative privileges on the local machine are required both to install and
develop applications with Microsoft Visual C++.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Visual C++ was developed to use features of Windows and to allow for
development of programs that require administrative privileges on the local
machine where Visual C++ is installed. So to install or to use Visual C++, a
developer is assumed to have administrative privileges on the local machine.

On Windows 95 and Windows 98, some privileges may be restricted using the Policy
Editor. A developer using Visual C++ must use an account that is unrestricted.

On Windows NT, a developer using Visual C++ must use an account that is a member
of the Administrators group.

Administrative privileges on a domain are not required for general Visual C++
installation and development activities.

Using an account that does not have administrative privileges on the local
machine might result in diminished capabilities or undefined behavior when using
Visual C++.
