TITLE   :Paper Bin Displays Incorrect Form to Tray Assignment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The form to tray assignment that is configured on the print server is not used
on the client computer. For example, if you configure the A4 format on the
server, the Letter format may appear on the client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a Windows NT client makes a printer connection, it copies the Form To Tray
Assignment data from the server to the client.


The following is an example of the data for an NEC Pinwriter P6:

   Tractor Feed: <A4>
   Sheet Feeder - Bin 1: <not available>
   Manual Paper Feed: <not available>

Perform the following steps to view this data:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the printer, click Properties, click the Device Settings tab, and
   then view the data for Form To Tray Assignment.

Internally, the paperbin names on the client and server are compared. If they are
identical, the correct values are displayed under the printer's device settings.
In this case, Tractor Feed displays Letter instead of A4.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when your environment consists of servers and clients
running different language versions of Windows NT.

To make sure a known paperbin is selected, the German client-side Rasddui.dll
file compares its own paperbin names with the paperbin names available for the
print server's printer. Because of a localization issue, the names do not match
and, therefore, the configured form on this paperbin is not found and a default
value is set.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
