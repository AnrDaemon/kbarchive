SYMPTOMS
========

After you have used the ActiveX Control Interface Wizard to expose both the
Appearance and BackColor properties of a control and you use the control in a
project, any changes that you make to the BackColor property in the control's
Properties window do not appear when you run the project.

expose the Appearance property.

STATUS

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Create a UserControl Using the ActiveX Control Interface Wizard:

1. Start Visual Basic 6.0, and open a new ActiveX Control project. Place a
   command button on the UserControl.

2. From the Add-Ins menu, select Add-In Manager and double-click "VB 6 ActiveX
   Ctl Interface Wizard" in the Available Add-Ins column. Click OK to dismiss
   the dialog.

3. From the Add-Ins menu, select ActiveX Control Interface Wizard.

   NOTE: If the Introduction screen for the ActiveX Control Interface Wizard
   appears, click Next.

4. In the Select Interface Member screen, choose the Appearance property from
   the Available Names list on the left, click the ">" button to add it to
   the Selected Names list on the right. Click Next.

5. When the Create Custom Interface Members screen appears, click Next.

6. In the Set Mapping window, under the Public Name list, select the Appearance
   and BackColor properties for the UserControl member in the Control and Member
   lists. Click Next.

7. In the Set Attributes window, click Finish. Click Close to quit the ActiveX
   Control Interface Wizard Summary dialog box.

8. From the File menu, select Make Project1.ocx to compile the control.

Test the UserControl in Another Project:

1. Create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Select Components from the Project menu. Add the UserControl to the toolbox
   by selecting it from the list and clicking Apply.

3. Place the UserControl from the toolbox onto Form1 in your Standard EXE
   project.

4. In the Properties window, change the BackColor Property of the ActiveX
   Control to Red.

5. Press the F5 key to run the project.

RESULT: The UserControl appears with the design-time BackColor (based on the
Appearance Property setting) instead of the BackColor (Red) that you chose in
the Properties Window for that control.
