The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you run a setup program that was created with the Application Setup Wizard
in earlier versions of Visual Basic, the application's shortcut is created
directly on the Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows
Me, Microsoft Windows 2000, or Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Programs menu by
default. Program groups are only created if there are multiple shortcuts, the
installation is on an earlier version of Windows or NT, or the Setup Toolkit
project is modified.

When you run a setup program that was created using the Package and Deployment
Wizard (PDW) in Visual Basic 6.0, the application's shortcut is always placed in
a program group by default. However, you can create a shortcut directly on the
Programs menu by modifying the steps used in the PDW. This article describes how
to accomplish this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a shortcut for the application directly on the Programs menu, follow
these steps in the Start Menu Items screen of the PDW:

1. Under Start Menu Items, select the program group for your application.

   For example, if the name of your project is Hello, you will see a program
   group named Hello with a shortcut named Hello below it. Select the program
   group named Hello.

2. Click Remove, and then click New Item.

3. In the Target list, click the program file you want the shortcut to start.

4. In the Start In list, click $(AppPath).

5. In the Name box, type the name you want to give the shortcut, and click OK.

6. Click Next, and then complete the remaining screens in the PDW as
   appropriate.
