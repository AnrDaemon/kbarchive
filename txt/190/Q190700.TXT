The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains what Microsoft Exchange Server services need to be running
to create an Exchange Server mailbox, either manually using the Exchange Server
Administrator program or as part of a batch process using the batch import
program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to create a new mailbox, the Microsoft Exchange Server System Attendant
and Microsoft Exchange Server Directory service must be running.

The Information Store service does not need to be running.

When a mailbox is created, only a Directory Service object is created. When a
user logs into that mailbox for the first time, or that mailbox receives mail,
the Information Store object for that mailbox will be automatically generated.

This can result in the mailbox not having any mailbox resources displayed in the
Administrator program.
