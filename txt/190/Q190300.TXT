======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In a Systems Management Server site, Windows NT clients must have the Server
Service running. The Server Service is necessary for the remote installation and
update of the client-side services on Windows NT-based systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Server Service is required because the Systems Management Server Client
Configuration Manager Service must be able to connect to the client's registry
remotely to add the Systems Management Server Client Services and to make any
other changes required to the client's registry.

Running Windows NT systems with the Server Service disabled in a Systems
Management Server site is an untested configuration and may lead to other
issues.
