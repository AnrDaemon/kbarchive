TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Service Is Not Copying Administrator on NDRs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message through the Internet Mail Service, with a bad SMTP
address, the receiving host may respond with a "550"' error after the RCPT TO:
command is sent (RFC-821). The Internet Mail Service then generates a
non-delivery report (NDR) and sends it to the user. This NDR is not copied to
the Administrator mailbox, even though the notifications button on the Internet
Mail Service is set to "All."

Examples of NDRs that do make it to the Administrator mailbox include the
following:

 - Unbalanced open & closed brackets

 - Host unknown

 - Max time for delivery expired

NOTE: This may not be a complete listing and is subject to change.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0.
