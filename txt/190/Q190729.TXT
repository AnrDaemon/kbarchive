SUMMARY
=======

When you edit or create a new distribution list in the Exchange Server
Administrator program, there is no data field to enter a Company value.

To enter a Company name for a distribution list, perform the following steps:

1. In the Administrator program, select Tools and choose Directory Export to
   export the distribution list to a CSV file.

2. Modify the CSV file to add the column "Company."

3. Modify the CSV file to enter the company information in the Company column.

4. Import the updated CSV file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A complete CSV file with all possible headers can be found on the Exchange
Server 4.0 disc under Support\Samples\Csvs\Mailbox\Mailbox.csv. For more
information about the Import/Export process, see the following article in the
