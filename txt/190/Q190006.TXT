TITLE   :"ODBC Drivers Error 80004005" When Browsing ASP Pages
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When browsing an ASP page, the following error may occur:

   OLE DB Provider error for ODBC Drivers error 80004005
   [Microsoft] [ODBC Driver Manager] Data Source Name not found and no default
   driver specified.

CAUSE
=====

The Global.asa file is not located in the root directory of the application.

WORKAROUND
==========

To determine if a directory is designated as an application root and verify that
it also contains the Global.asa file, perform the following steps:

1. In the Internet Service Manager (ISM), verify that the node is configured as
   an application.

   To do this, verify that the node displays the package icon in the ISM. To
   further verify, view the property sheet for that node. On the Virtual
   Directory tab, under Application Settings, an active name should be listed
   for the application. If the name is "Default Application" and it appears
   dimmed, the node is NOT an application.

2. Verify that the Global.asa file is located in the root directory of the
   application.

   To determine the root directory of the application, view the property sheet
   for the application. Check the Local Path setting on the Virtual Directory
   tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is known to occur after you have used Visual InterDev to create a
sample ASP page, which works. However, when you try to incorporate that sample
ASP code in your application, the error occurs.

For more information about the Global.asa file, see the Windows NT Option Pack
Product Documentation. On the Index tab, type "GLOBAL.ASA" (without the
quotation marks), and then select the "Global.asa File Reference (IIS)" topic.
