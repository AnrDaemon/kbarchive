OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbide kbVC500 kbOSWinCEsearch kbOSWin98

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 or the Windows CE
Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 on Windows 98, you might get the following
error when opening or debugging a project in Developer Studio:

   Microsoft Developer Studio
   EM.DLL
   This required file cannot be loaded.
   Please re-install Microsoft Developer Studio

This might result in Developer Studio crashing with the following error:

   MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module DEVDBG.PKG at
   015f:50c4fc9a.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 98 installs an older version of ImageHlp.dll (file version 4.00) in the
System directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the ImageHlp.dll (file version 5.00.1418.1) from the
DevStudio\SharedIDE\bin directory into the Windows System directory to overwrite
the older ImageHlp.dll.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 98 ships ImageHlp.dll, file version 4.00 with a May 1998 date. The
Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 ships ImageHlp.dll file version
5.00.1418.1. This newer DLL contains functions that the older DLL does not have.
The Visual C++ debugger as modified by the Windows CE Toolkit uses some of these
new functions. The debugger cannot function without the newer functions, so
Developer Studio is terminated.

The Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 and Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for
Visual C++ 5.0 product requirements state that Windows NT 4.0 is needed,
therefore toolkit features are not guaranteed to work under Windows 95 and
Windows 98.
