KEYWORDS:kbDespooler smsdespooler

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When processing a status MIF, the despooler records the following entries in the
Despool.log file:

   ~Found ready instruction sni00000.sni
   ~Executing instruction of type MICROSOFT|SMS|DOMAIN_COMMISSAR_WIREMOVE
   ~Compilation failed~syntax error on line ..., token ...
   ~Despooler failed to execute the instruction, error code = cb

The status MIF is discarded and the Workstation Status is set to "Complete" for
the target computer even if it was a "Failed" status MIF.

For more information about the error code cb, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MIF is discarded. By default, the status is set to success.
