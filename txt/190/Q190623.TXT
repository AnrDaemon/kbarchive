SUMMARY
=======

A Visual FoxPro Active Document application is a Visual FoxPro application that
can be hosted in an Active Document container such as Microsoft Internet
Explorer.

When you develop an Active Document application, special considerations must be
made when determining how the application will access any required data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an Active Document is hosted in Internet Explorer, the application is
downloaded to the local disk before it is executed. At this point, the Active
Document application behaves the same as any other local Visual FoxPro
applications with respect to data access.

The most common implementation of a Visual FoxPro Active Document application is
over a corporate Intranet. The Active Document application offers many benefits
over a traditional application with respect to application deployment and
maintenance, and the underlying local area network (LAN) in the corporate
environment offers a mechanism for easy access to remote data. In the corporate
Intranet scenario, the Active Document application accesses data on a remote
computer through the use of a mapped network drive or a universal naming
convention (UNC) path that points to the remote data.

When deploying an Active Document application over the Internet, some other
mechanism for accessing the data must be provided. Visual FoxPro provides no
native capability of directly accessing data over the Internet. One possible
solution is the use of ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) to access data over the
Internet from within a Visual FoxPro Active Document application. For more
information regarding ADO, refer to the Microsoft ADO Web Page at the following
