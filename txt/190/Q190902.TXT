SUMMARY
=======

The Help topic AddLabel in Visual FoxPro for Windows version 6.00 refers to
various application source files that you can use to customize the AddLabel
feature. If you search your hard drive after installing Visual FoxPro, you will
not find these files because they are contained in a file named XSource.zip.

MORE INFORMATION
================

XSource.zip is located in the \VFP98\Tools\XSource folder.

1. Unzip the files in the XSource.zip using the UNZIP -d parameter to preserve
   subdirectory names. You may select the folder where the XSource.zip file
   resides.

2. A subdirectory named \VFPSource is created.

3. Several subfolders are created. One is named \Addlabel, which contains the
   following files:

      Studio\Vfp98\Tools\XSource\vfpsource\Addlabel
