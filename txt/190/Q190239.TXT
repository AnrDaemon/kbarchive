The following macro is designed to edit an "Embed MSGraph.Chart.8" object in a
Word document. If your graph is a floating object, replace the InlineShapes
property in the macro with the Shapes property.

The preferred method for accessing Microsoft Graph for Windows object properties
is to add the Microsoft Graph 8.0 Object Library as an available reference. To
add the Microsoft Graph 8.0 Object Library reference in Word, follow these
steps:

1. In the Visual Basic Editor, click References on the Tools menu.

2. Under Available References, click to select the "Microsoft Graph 8.0 Object
   Library" check box.

3. Click OK.

After creating the reference, create and run the following Visual Basic macro:

   Sub EditDocChart()
      Dim Mychart As Object
      ' Activate the first object in the document for editing.
      ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).OLEFormat.Edit
      ' Make Mychart equal to MsGraph.Chart.8 object.
      Set Mychart = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).OLEFormat.Object
      ' Change the value in the datasheet cell referenced in the range.
      Mychart.Application.DataSheet.Range("a1").Value = "75"
      Mychart.Application.Update
      ' Change the chart type (remove the apostrophe from the beginning of
      ' the line that corresponds with the type of chart you want to change
      ' to).
      'Mychart.Application.Chart.ChartType = xlBarStacked
      'Mychart.Application.Chart.ChartType = xlPie
      Mychart.Application.Quit
      Set Mychart = Nothing
      ' Deselect the edited graph by moving insertion point.
      Selection.HomeKey Unit:=wdStory, Extend:=wdMove
   End Sub
