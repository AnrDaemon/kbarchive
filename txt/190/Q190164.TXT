SUMMARY
=======

Using the Terminal Server console as a user workstation has advantages.
Developing applications in a multi-user environment is not recommended, but
developers may want to use Terminal Server as a workstation. If you use the
Terminal Server client directly on the Terminal Server console as the normal
desktop, then you have the option to disconnect the session. When you
disconnect, use RAS to connect to the network while off-site, and use the client
on a remote computer to reconnect to the normal desktop on the Terminal Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are some suggestions for using Terminal Server as a single user
workstation.

1. Use the Terminal Server Client on the console as the normal desktop to allow
   reconnection from remote sites.

2. Use a minimum of 64 MB of RAM.

3. Set the IdleWinStationPoolCount to 0 (zero). You find this setting under
   HKEY\LOCAL\MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server. This
   setting tells Terminal Server not to create any idle sessions until needed,
   saving you two instances of WinLogon and CSRSS.


4. If you don't use NetDDE, then remove the Nddeagnt.exe from the list of
   processes that start when a user logs on. This value is set in the UserInit
   value under the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WinLogon
   key.

5. For remote access, turn off Menu & Window animated effects by setting the
   MinAnimate flag to zero (0) (a string containing a zero). This value is
   located under HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics.

6. Turn off Smooth Scrolling in Internet Explorer 4.0.

7. Consider sharing the RDP client if you frequently work at different computers
   and would like to get your normal desktop. This allows you to connect to the
   client share, and to run MSTSC.EXE remotely, without having to install the
   client everywhere you work.
