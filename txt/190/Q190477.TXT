TITLE   :BUG: Run-time Error '326' with LoadResData
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When loading an Icon from a resource file with LoadResData, you receive the
following run-time error:

   Run-Time error '326': Resource with identifier '101' not found

The LoadResData documentation states that it is possible to return an icon from a
resource file in the form of a byte array. Doing so will result in the above
error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the LoadResPicture function to load an icon resource. For example,

      Private Sub Form_Load()
         Dim vMyIcon As Variant

         vMyIcon = LoadResPicture(101,vbResIcon)

      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

NOTE: These steps assume the Resource Editor is installed and available in Visual
Basic from the Tools menu.

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Paste the following code into the Form1's code window:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Dim vMyIcon As Variant

            vMyIcon = LoadResData(101, 3)

         End Sub

3. From the Tools menu, select the Resource Editor.

4. Select the Add Icon option.

5. Browse and select an icon to use. After selecting the icon, the Resource
   Editor should show an Icon resource with the id of '101'.

6. Select the Save option on the Resource Editor. Save the Resource File as
   "TEST.RES". Once this is done, the Project Browser will show an additional
   folder called "Related Documents." This folder will contain the newly-created
   Resource File.

7. Press the F5 key to run the application. Note that the following error will
   occur:

   Run-time error "326"; Resource with identifier '101' not found
