SYMPTOMS
========

When you create or update a table of contents, the resulting table of contents
is missing some entries. If Microsoft Word finds no entries to use in the table
of contents, the following error message appears in the document:

   Error! No table of contents entries found

CAUSE
=====

When Word builds a table of contents, it does not look in the drawing layer for
text to include in the table of contents. Word looks only in the document
layer.

Text boxes and callouts are placed in the drawing layer. Therefore, Word ignores
any TC fields or heading styles that appear in text boxes or callouts when it
builds or updates the table of contents.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Place the text or TC field that you want included in the table of contents in
   the document layer instead of the drawing layer.

   NOTE: If you have selected an object in the drawing layer prior to inserting a
   caption, the caption will also be in the drawing layer. If the insertion
   point is outside the object, then the caption will be on the text layer.

   -or-

 - Place the text or TC field in a frame instead of in a text box or callout.

   NOTE: In Word 97 for Windows, frames are not readily available. You need to
   enter the information into either a text box or caption and then convert that
   object to a frame by following these steps:

   1. Click once on either the text box or caption to select it.

   2. On the Format menu, select either Text Box or AutoShape, and then select
      the Text Box tab.

   3. Click the Convert To Frame button. Click Yes to confirm that you want to
      convert it to a frame. Note that you may lose some formatting, especially
      if you are converting a caption.
