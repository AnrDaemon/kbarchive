SUMMARY
=======

Visual C++ is missing F1 Help documentation for the macro names in the Directory
and Files drop-down lists. A list of macro names appears upon clicking either
the Directory or Files button. The Directory and Files buttons are located on
the Custom Build tab of the Project Settings dialog box.

Search within Visual Studio 97 Help for the "Macros for Custom Build Commands"
topic for information describing these macros. The Directory and Files buttons
have pop-up help. Click the "?" symbol on the upper-right corner of the Project
Settings dialog box, then click the Directory or Files button. The Help does not
describe the functionality of the macros in the drop-down lists.

Additional query words: kbdocerr kbvc500 kbvc600
