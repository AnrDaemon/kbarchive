SYMPTOMS
========

When a user sends a message with an attachment embedded in the text through the
Internet Mail Service (Internet Mail Connector in Exchange Server 4.0), when the
message is received, the attachment moves to either the top or the bottom of the
message depending on the client. In the Microsoft Outlook client, the attachment
will be located at the bottom of the received message with all the text above
it. When you open the same message in the Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Client, the
attachment is located above the text. Moreover, when the message received in the
Outlook client is printed, the attachment moves to the top of the message with
the text below it.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the received message has an attachment, have the recipients look both at the
top and the bottom of the messages for the attachments.

STATUS
======

This is by design. It is the default behavior of the Microsoft Exchange and
Microsoft Outlook clients for messages received through the Internet Mail
Service. The only way to preserve attachment position at this time is with TNEF
(Transport Neutral Encoding Format).
