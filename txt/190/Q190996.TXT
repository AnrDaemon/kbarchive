TITLE   :XADM: Operation Terminated With Error -1911 Using ESEUTIL /d
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It may be necessary to defragment an Exchange Server 5.5 database on a Windows
NT Server that does not have Exchange Server installed.

When you attempt to defragment an Exchange Server database using ESEUTIL /d you
may receive the following error:

   Operation terminated with error -1911 (JET_errEntryPointNotFound, An
   entry point in a DLL we require could not be found) after 0.0 seconds.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because you must have at least Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2
installed on the non-Exchange Server computer to be able to use ESEUTIL /d.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is recommended that Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or later be installed on
the non-Exchange Server computer when using ESEUTIL with the defragmentation
option.

Service Packs for Windows NT can be found on the Microsoft FTP server at:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes
