TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Service Does Not Clean Up Temp Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Administrators of Microsoft Exchange server version 5 will notice that when the
Internet Mail Service is cycled during an open, inbound session with another
host, the temporary file used for the message in transit will not be removed
when the service is restarted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although these temporary files are "stranded," they do not represent lost mail.
The sending host will try to deliver the mail later, because the entire
transaction was not completed. These stranded files can be deleted if necessary,
without impacting the Internet Mail Service performance.

Below is a sample of what you should see in the stranded temporary file:

   233][ASCII 188]        test.dns.microsoft.com test.dns.microsoft.com
