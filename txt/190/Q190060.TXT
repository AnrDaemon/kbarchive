SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a program that installs DirectX, or you install DirectX from
the Microsoft Web site, your computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a sound card based on the Crystal Audio chipset is
installed in your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove or remark out any lines in the Autoexec.bat and
Config.sys files that refer to the Cwcmidi.exe file.

For additional information how to modify the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files,

   Q190024 How to Edit the Config.sys File in Windows 98

When you remove or remark out the lines that refer to the Cwcmidi.exe file in the
Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files, you may no longer hear sounds in some MS-DOS
programs.

To resolve this issue, add the lines that refer to the Cwcmidi.exe file to the
Autoexec.dos and the Config.dos files, and then create a program information
(.pif) file that uses the Autoexec.dos and Config.dos files when you start these
MS-DOS programs.
