TITLE   :Import COBOL Wizard Cannot Select LL, ZZ, TRANCODE (IMS)
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While using the Component Builder's Import COBOL Wizard, the user is asked to
select the IMS-related variables for the LL, ZZ, and TRANCODE fields for
exclusion from the parameter list. However, the Select control button is not
enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, skip the steps of the Import COBOL Wizard for
excluding the LL, ZZ, and TRANCODE fields. Perform all the other steps. After
the wizard is finished, while still in the Component Builder, go to the
parameter list created for each IMS method and manually remove the parameters
specified for these IMS-related variables, the LL, ZZ, and TRANCODE fields.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0 included with SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 1.
