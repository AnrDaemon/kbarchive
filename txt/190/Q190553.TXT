The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Internet Explorer and Visual Basic use different formats for Color literals.
Internet Explorer's Object model uses a format of RRGGBB whereas Visual Basic
uses the format BBGGRR. When attempting to chance colors of Dynamic HTML
elements in your DHTML Page Designer project, use the RRGGBB format. Do not use
Visual Basic color constants such as vbRed and vbBlue.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You will not be able to use Visual Basic's constants vbRed and vbBlue when
programming for the Internet Explorer's object model. Following are examples of
problems you will see when writing code in Visual Basic 6.0 DHTML Page Designer
object using these constants:

   

   field1.style.color=vbRed    'Will cause the text to be Blue
   field1.style.color=vbBlue   'Will cause the text to be Red
   field1.style.color=vbGreen  'Will cause the text to be Green

You will not be able to use the RGB function such as Hex(RGB(0, 0, 255)) to
specify colors for Dynamic HTML elements.

To change the color of the Dynamic HTML elements in your DHTML Page Designer
project, use the RRGGBB (where R=Red, G=Green, and B=Blue) color constants.

The same applies to creating color constants for use in WebClasses in Visual
Basic 6.0 IIS Applications. Use the RRGGBB format color constants.
