-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1

SUMMARY
=======

To configure a Hayes Optima modem to communicate with an SNA Server SDLC link
service in a switched line environment, the following commands must be sent to
the modem. These commands will set the modem for synchronous mode and store a
phone number in the modem. When SNA Server is started, this will cause the modem
to automatically dial the stored number.

Hyperterminal can be used to send the commands to the modem while the modem is
still connected to the SDLC card in the computer. It is not necessary to move
the cable to a serial port to configure the modem.

Send the following strings to the modem:

   "AT&F&Y
   AT&Z0=Txxx-xxxx
   AT&Q2&C1&D2&S1
   ATE0Q1&W" (without the quotation marks)

Replace xxx-xxxx with the phone number you want the modem to dial.

NOTE: These settings will overwrite any previously stored startup parameters.

MORE INFORMATION

Here is the meaning of the required modem commands. For additional information,
refer to the documentation accompanying your modem.

In SNA Server's configuration for the link service, set the line type for
Switched: Modem-Stored Number.
