      ox.Show

      DEFINE CLASS test AS form

         Caption = "Form1"
         Name = "Form1"

         ADD OBJECT olecontrol1 AS olecontrol WITH ;
            OleClass = "MSComCtlLib.TreeCtrl.2", ;
            DragMode = 1, ;
            Top = 24, ;
            Left = 36, ;
            Height = 180, ;
            Width = 276, ;
            Name = "Olecontrol1"

         PROCEDURE olecontrol1.Init
         this.nodes.add(,,"r","Test")

display correctly.
