TITLE   :PRB: Error Setting Field Format Property of Access Tables

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

From Visual Basic, when trying to specify a field Format property of an Access
table (for example, field type DateTime) from blank to "Long Date" format, the
following error occurs:

   Run-time error '3421':

   Data type conversion error.

CAUSE
=====

The property data type constant should always be "dbText." If other data type
constants, such as dbDate or dbNumeric are specified, you will encounter the
error described above.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following Visual Basic 5.0 example creates a new field object MyNewDate with
data type dbDate, and appends it to the Fields collection. It then specifies the
Format property with the value "Long Date." Note that the Format property is
specified as "dbDate," which is incorrect. To correct the problem, you should
change:

      Set prp = fld.CreateProperty("Format", dbDate)

to:

       Set prp = fld.CreateProperty("Format", dbText)

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a "Standard EXE" project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, select References, and then place a check next to
   Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library.

   In Visual Basic 4.0, you can reference Microsoft DAO Object Library from Tools
   menu, then select References.

3. Add a CommandButton control, Command1, to Form1.

4. Paste the following code in the Command1_Click() code snippet:

         Dim db As Database
         Dim tdf As TableDef
         Dim fld As Field
         Dim prp As Property
         
         Set db = OpenDatabase("Nwind.mdb")
         Set tdf = db.TableDefs("Employees")
         tdf.Fields.Append tdf.CreateField("MyNewDate", dbDate) 'Error line
         Set fld = tdf.Fields("MyNewDate")
         Set prp = fld.CreateProperty("Format", dbDate)
         prp.Value = "Long Date"
         fld.Properties.Append prp
