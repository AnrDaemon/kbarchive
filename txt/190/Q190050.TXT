TITLE   :PRB: BuildFile Property of DHTML Application Is Missing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0;
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInternet kbOSWinNT kbPageDesigner kbVBp600 kbOSWin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are creating a silent build of a DHTML application, you get a dialog
box that prompts you for the BuildFile. The .htm file from your DHTML
application is not included in the package of the Package and Deployment Wizard
by default.

CAUSE
=====

No value is entered in the BuildFile property of your DHTML application.

RESOLUTION
==========

By default, the BuildFile property is set to the value of the SourceFile
property. The SourceFile Property is null if you select "Save HTML inside the VB
Project" in the .DHTMLPage Properties dialog box. As a result, the BuildFile
property is null by default. You need to select "Save HTML in an external file"
in the .DHTMLPage Properties dialog box to set the SourceFile Property, which
sets the BuildFile property. Make sure you set the BuildFile property, and
always enter a fully qualified path.

NOTE: You want to store your page as an external .html file. The DHTML Page
designer has some editing limitations. If you do not store your page as an
external .html file, you will not be able to use an external editor on this
page.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
