TITLE   :PRB: Unusual Characteristics of the ActiveMovie Control
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the ActiveMovie ActiveX control on a form in Visual FoxPro, some
properties for the control are not listed in the Properties dialog box. These
properties are available programmatically, they just do not appear in the
Properties dialog box for the control. Also, when you right-click the
ActiveMovieControl Active Movie Control Properties menu item, the Properties
dialog box for the control does not display.

CAUSE
=====

The SYS(2333) function that turns ActiveX dual interface support on and off must
be set to ON.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Visual FoxPro 5.0 and 6.0, turn the SYS(2333) function off and the missing
properties appear in the Properties dialog box. In Visual FoxPro 3.0, you must
access the missing properties programmatically.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, the SYS(2333) function is turned on by default. In Visual
FoxPro 6.0, the SYS(2333) function is turned off by default. Turning off the
SYS(2333) allows the missing properties to be seen. The SYS(2333) function is
not available in Visual FoxPro 3.0. The only way to access the missing
properties in Visual FoxPro 3.0 is to programmatically assign values to them.

Another characteristic of the ActiveMovie control is that when you right- click
the control and select the ActiveMovieControl Active Movie Control Properties
menu, the properties dialog box for the ActiveMovie control does not open.
Instead, the display of the ActiveMovie control changes and if you right-click
the ActiveMovie control again, there is an About ActiveMovie menu item instead
of the ActiveMovieControl ActiveMovie Control Properties menu item. This happens
regardless of the status of the SYS(2333) function.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Issue the =SYS(2333,1) command in the Command window.

2. Create a form in Visual FoxPro and add the OLE Container control if you are
   using Visual FoxPro 5.0. If you are using Visual FoxPro 6.0, insert the
   ActiveX control (OleControl).

3. In the Insert Object dialog box, select the Create Control option button.

4. In the Object Type list, click ActiveMovieControl object and then click OK.

5. If the Properties dialog box is not displayed on the desktop, right-click the
   form, and select the Properties dialog box.

6. Scroll through the properties in the dialog box and note that properties like
   AutoRewind, FileName, and PlayCount are not listed.

7. Close the form and the Properties dialog box, issue =SYS(2333,0) in the
   Command window, and open the form. Note that all the properties are now
   listed for the ActiveMovie control in the Properties dialog box.
