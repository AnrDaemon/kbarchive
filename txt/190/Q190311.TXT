OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600 kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Visual FoxPro top-level form is in a modal state, the Visual FoxPro icon
does not appear in the Windows task list when you use ALT+TAB to switch tasks.

CAUSE
=====

The top-level form and Visual FoxPro are both sharing the same process. The
modal behavior in the top-level form must be completed before the Visual FoxPro
icon reappears in the task list.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Choose Coverage Profiler from the Tools menu.

2. Press the ALT+TAB keys.

The Coverage Profiler icon is present in the task list, but the Visual FoxPro
icon is no longer present.
