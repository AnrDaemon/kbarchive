KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Visual SourceSafe (VSS) 5.0 project in Visual FoxPro 6.0 using
Visual SourceSafe 6.0 as the current source code control provider, a Source Code
Control (SCC) error occurs. The project is added to Visual SourceSafe 6.0, but
the following error message appears:

   SCC API error 'Project created' occurred. The project will be opened without
   source control.

The next time you open the project, the error does not occur. The project is
under source control without explicitly adding it to source control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project in Visual FoxPro 5.0 and place it under Visual SourceSafe
   5.0 source control.

2. Modify the project in Visual FoxPro 6.0 using Visual SourceSafe 6.0 source
   control.

RESULT: When you initially open the project in Visual FoxPro 6.0, the error
occurs. When you modify the project in Visual FoxPro 6.0 with Visual SourceSafe
6.0 as the source code control provider, the error will not occur.
