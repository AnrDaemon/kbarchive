PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ReadMethod of an object can be used to return the text of a given method.
The ReadMethod is only supported when the class is stored in a visual class
library (VCX). Classes that are defined in code do not support the ReadMethod.
This also holds true for the following methods:

   ReadExpression
   WriteMethod
   WriteExpression

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following code:

      ox = CreateObject("myclass")
      ?ox.ReadMethod('mymethod')

      DEFINE Class myclass As Custom
         PROCEDURE mymethod
            WAIT WINDOW 'hello'
         ENDPROC
      ENDDEFINE

The ReadMethod does not return anything.
