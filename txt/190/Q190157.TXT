The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack is not supported on Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition. Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack is not supported because both
Internet Information Server 4.0 and Microsoft Transaction Server do not function
correctly when installed on Terminal Server. Customer applications which require
these Option Pack technologies may not function properly when installed on
Terminal Server.

Microsoft recommends that customers use Internet Information Server 3.0, which
ships with Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, for Web Server
functionality on the Terminal Server.

Also, Site Server is not supported on Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.
