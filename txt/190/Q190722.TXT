PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to move users from one Exchange Server computer to another, the
following warning message may be written to the Windows NT application event
log:

   Event ID: 1151
   Source: MSExchangeIS Private
   Type:   Warning
   Category: Rules

   A Rule synchronization error (1144) has occurred.
   The private folder is Top of Information Store\Inbox
   The distinguished name of the owning mailbox is:
   /O=ORG/OU=SITE/CN=Recipients/CN=123456

The affected user can not move messages from the Exchange information store to a
PST file. The user will receive the following error message:

   An item could not be moved. The client operation failed.

CAUSE
=====

The ISINTEG utility was run with the following parameters:

   ISINTEG -pri -fix -detailed -test namedprop

The issue occurs when messages have MAPI properties assigned that have no mapped
name; this can be caused by third-party applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

It is also necessary to run Isinteg.exe again with the following parameters:

   ISINTEG -pri -fix -detailed -test namedprop




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
