======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you issue commands such as INDEX, REPLACE ALL, or PACK, some computers may
take a long time to finish processing the results. This only occurs if the
computer is running the Windows NT 4.0 operating system. Also, the faster the
computer and the more RAM that is installed, the more time that it takes for the
computer to finish the command's tasks. Visual FoxPro also shows as "Not
Responding" in the Application tab of the Task Manager, but in fact, is working
to complete the task.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In testing this, it seems that setting SYS(3050) to 1 MG seems to decrease the
time it takes to finish these tasks. Try this command before issuing the other
commands listed in this article.

       =SYS(3050,1,1000000)

FoxPro can normally process one of the commands listed in the SYMPTOMS section in
a very short time, even on a large table. However, on several of the new faster
computers, Visual FoxPro slows down drastically when processing these commands.
The computers that seem to have this problem are 233 MHz and up, and have at
least 64 MB of RAM. It has been reported that 200 MHz computers also display
this behavior, but the sluggishness is more pronounced as the speed and amount
of RAM of the computer increases.

Another way to observe that the computer is struggling to process the command, is
to open the Windows NT Task Manager, click the Applications tab and note that
Visual FoxPro is "Not Responding". During the whole process, the hard drive of
the computer runs constantly, trying to finish the task.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Locate a computer with a 233 MHz or higher processor and at least 64 MB of
   RAM with Windows NT 4.0 as the operating system.

2. USE a table with 100,000 records or more as a good test.

3. Issue the PACK command in the Command window, and note that it takes a
   considerable amount of time to pack the table. Open the Windows NT Task
   Manager dialog box and click the Applications tab. In the status section, it
   shows that Visual FoxPro is not responding at various times during the
   packing of the table.
