SUMMARY
=======

Add-Ins for Microsoft Visual Basic may use satellite DLLs that contain resources
such as localization information. This article describes the search patterns
used by an Add-In to locate the satellite DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When loading an Add-In, Microsoft Visual Basic attempts to look for a Satellite
DLL in the following order:

1. <Path To Add-In>\Resources\<LocaleID>

   The LocaleID identifies the locale language that the current Operating System
   is running under. Visual Basic will look for a satellite DLL first in the
   LocaleID directory.

2. <Path To Add-In>\Resources\1033

   Visual Basic will search for an English directory (1033 is the LocaleID for
   Standard English).

3. <Path To Add-In>\

   The directory where the Add-In is installed will be searched last.
