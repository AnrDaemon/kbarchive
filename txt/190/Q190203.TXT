SYMPTOMS
========

After you restart after applying the PPTP and RRAS hotfix packs, the following
STOP error message appears soon after Windows NT boots. This STOP message will
also occur every time a Demand Dial connection tries to dial by using a static
route:

   *** STOP: 0x0000000A (0xXXXXXXXX,0x00000002,0x00000001,0xF8E5FCE5)

CAUSE
=====

You have installed an older version of the RRAS hotfix pack. The Wanarp.sys that
is currently installed is incompatible with the new version of Tcpip.sys that
was installed by the PPTP hotfix.
