TITLE   :PRB: TITLEBAR = 0 Does Not Carry Over from Base Class
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you subclass a form based on the Top-Level form class definition and the
Top-Level form class TitleBar property is set to 0 (zero), the TitleBar property
does not get implemented in the subclassed form.

RESOLUTION
==========

To workaround this behavior, place "Desktop = .T." in the class definition code
as shown in the MORE INFORMATION section.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a .prg file.

2. Paste the following program into the .PRG file:

         PUBLIC x
         x=CREATEOBJECT("frmform")
         x.SHOW

         DEFINE CLASS frmform AS FORM
            ShowWindow = 2
            TitleBar = 0
            *Desktop = .T.  && Uncomment this property to hide the TitleBar.
            ADD OBJECT command1 AS CommandButton

            PROCEDURE command1.Click
               Thisform.Release
            ENDPROC

         ENDDEFINE

3. Save and run the .RRG

NOTE: The form appears with a TitleBar even though the TitleBar property is set
to 0 (off) in the class definition.
