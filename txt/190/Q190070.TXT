TITLE   :PRB: Old ACCESS/ASSIGN Refs Remain on Property Name Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The code in renamed ACCESS and ASSIGN methods still references the original
property name.

RESOLUTION
==========

The references must be changed manually by performing a REPLACE on all objects
of "THIS.old" (where "old" is the original property name), with "THIS.new"
(where "new" is the revised property name).

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add a new property called "OLD" with ACCESS and ASSIGN
   methods. Close the New Property dialog box.

2. Change the "Old" property name to "New" via the Edit Property/Method dialog
   box ([Form][Edit Property/Method]). When prompted, change the "old_access"
   and "old_assign" method names, as well.

3. Close the Edit Property/Method dialog box and modify the "new_access" and
   "new_assign" methods.

In the "new_access" method, the original code remains "RETURN THIS.old"; in the
"new_assign" method the following code remains "THIS.old = m.vNewVal".

For the ACCESS and ASSIGN methods to affect the new property name, the old
property reference must be updated. As indicated in the RESOLUTION section
above, the best way of ensuring that all property references are changed is to
use the Editor and search through all objects.
