SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to work with the Password Dialog Box Foundation Class
included in Visual FoxPro Windows 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

_login is the Password Dialog box class and it is stores in the _dialog.vcx
class library.

The properties and methods that you will need to set up a Password Dialog box
include cFieldName, cPassword, cTable, cDBFName and the Setup method.

The cTable property contains the alias name of the user password table. The
CDBFName property contains the actual filename of the user password table with a
qualified path. The cPassword property contains the name of the field where the
user password is stored. The CFieldName property contains the name of the field
storing the user name. The Setup method is to set up the RowSource for the
username drop-down list box.

Sample Code
-----------

      * The following sample code creates a table with username and
      * password.

      CREATE TABLE cust ( username C(15), cpassw C(6))
      INSERT INTO cust (username, cpassw) VALUES ("Smith","bird")
      INSERT INTO cust (username, cpassw) VALUES ("Tim","dog")
      INSERT INTO cust (username, cpassw) VALUES ("Robert","mouse")
      INSERT INTO cust (username, cpassw) VALUES ("Tina","cat")

      PUBLIC passobj
      CLOSE TABLE ALL

      * Calls _login from _Dialogs and sets properties for the dialog.
      * Adjust the path to the class library as needed.
      passobj = NEWOBJECT("_login",HOME()+"ffc\_dialogs.vcx")
      passobj.cDBFName = "c:\test\cust.dbf"
      passobj.cTable = "cust"
      passobj.cPassword = "cpassw"
      passobj.cFieldName = "username"
      passobj.Setup()
      passobj.SHOW()
