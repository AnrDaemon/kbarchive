TITLE   :BUG: Queries or Views Do Not Appear in Data Form Wizard
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbAddIn kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Data Form Wizard, queries or views do not appear in the list of
available record sources.

CAUSE
=====

The Data Form Wizard incorrectly queries only for tables to populate the
drop-down combo box of available record sources.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select a table that closely matches the desired query to build your form, then
change the RecordSource property of the generated ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)
control (datPrimaryRS) to the desired query.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Visual Basic 6.0 and create a new Standard EXE project.

2. Use the Data Form Wizard to add a new form to the project (either through the
   Add-Ins menu or by adding a form and selecting the Data Form Wizard.)

3. Select "(None)" for "From what profile do you want to use to load your
   settings?" and click Next.

4. Select Access from the list of available database formats and click Next.

5. Supply the location of the sample Northwind database (Nwind.mdb) in the
   Database Name box and click Next.

6. Name the form "frmDemo" in the Form Name box and select Single Record for the
   form layout. Click Next.

7. Click Record Source. Notice the lack of Access queries.

Steps to View Queries
---------------------

Follow these steps to view queries using the RecordSource property:

1. Select Categories from the Record Source box, and add all the fields by
   clicking ">>". Click Next, and then Finish in the next dialog box.

2. Select the ADO data control (datPrimaryRS) on the form that was just
   generated for you (frmDemo).

3. Locate the RecordSource property and click the ellipses (...) on the right
   side of the properties box.

4. Change the command type in the Property Pages dialog box from "8 -
   adCmdUnknown" to "2 - adCmdTable".

5. Click on "Table or Stored Procedure Name". Notice all the tables and stored
   queries are displayed.
