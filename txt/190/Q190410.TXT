SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to set an ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) Data Control's Recordset
object to a previously dimensioned ADO Recordset the following error is
returned:

   Run-time error '3704':

   The operation requested by the application is not allowed if the object is
   closed.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the recordset has not been opened yet.

RESOLUTION
==========

The user may either open the recordset prior to assigning it to the ADO Data
Control (ADODC), or use the ADODC to create the recordset.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
