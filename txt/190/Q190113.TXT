TITLE   :BUG: Query Designer Generates Invalid SQL Statement
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, the Query Designer may generate invalid SQL statement
if database is MDB file. When the statement is executed, VB generates the
error:

   Syntax error in FROM clause

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually remove the braces "{}" and "oj" from the "From" statement.

Code Example
------------

Change the following statement

      SELECT Products.ProductName, `Order Details`.Quantity
      FROM { oj `Order Details` LEFT OUTER JOIN
      Products ON `Order Details`.ProductID = Products.ProductID }

To the following:

      SELECT Products.ProductName, `Order Details`.Quantity
      FROM `Order Details` LEFT OUTER JOIN
      Products ON `Order Details`.ProductID = Products.ProductID

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Visual Basic and create a new Standard EXE project.

2. On the Project menu, click Add a Data Environment.

3. Right click the connection, select Properties, and select OLEDB Provider for
   Jet 3.51.

4. Click the Connection tab and select the NWind.mdb by using the ellipsis
   button for item 1.

5. Right-click the connection and select "Add a Command."

6. Right-click Command1; select "SQL" as data source. Click SQL Build to launch
   the Query Designer.

7. Drag-drop Table "Order Details" and "Products" onto the diagram pane; there
   is a relationship between these two tables.

8. Check the column "ProductName" in Products and column "Quantity" in "Order
   Details."

9. Right-click the relationship line and select "select all rows from 'Order
   Details'."

RESULT: The SQL sentence in the SQL pane is:

      SELECT Products.ProductName, 'Order Details'.Quantity
      FROM { oj 'Order Details' LEFT OUTER JOIN
      Products ON 'Order Details'.ProductID = Products.ProductID }

This is an invalid SQL statement; when running it, Visual Basic generates "Syntax
error in FROM clause" when it attempts to save the query.
