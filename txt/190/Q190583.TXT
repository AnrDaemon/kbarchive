PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft's Remote Data Control 2.0 (RDC) without a User or System
DSN in the ODBC Data Source Administrator, trying to set the RDC's
DataSourceName property generates a run-time error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a DSN under ODBC or upgrade from MSRDC20.ocx version 5.00.3714 (or
5.01.4319), which is "Microsoft Remote Data Control 2.0," to MSRDC20.ocx version
6.00.816, which is "Microsoft Remote Data Control 6.0."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Please make sure that there are no User or System Data Source Names in the ODBC
Data Source Administrator.

1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is added by default.

2. From the Project menu, click Components, and select the Microsoft Remote Data
   Control 2.0 if it is not already loaded.

3. In Property browser, click DataSouceName. This will result in the following
   run-time error message:

   "Class not registered. Looking for object with CLSID
   {00000000-0000-0000-000000000000}"
