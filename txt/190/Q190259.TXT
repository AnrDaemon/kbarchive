   Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Microsoft Word 97 uses the MSword8.olb type library to obtain the values of
preprocessor directives used in Word VBA code. Visual FoxPro can not take
advantage of the type library. Using the values of these preprocessor directives
requires you to reference the constants in the Word Visual Basic Applications
Object Browser, or some other tool that can read information from the type
library.

The header file, Wordvba.h, can be included in FoxPro code. You can then use the
Word VBA constants as they are used in other VBA applications. A second way to
use this file is as a reference for Word 97 VBA constants without having to open
the Object Browser in Word. To use the file in Visual FoxPro for Windows, issue
the following command in your Visual FoxPro for Windows code:

      #INCLUDE WordVBA.H

Sample code for using the Word VBA header file instead of having to find the
values of the preprocessor directives follows.

Sample Code
-----------

      #INCLUDE WordVBA.H
      oword=CREATEOBJECT("Word.Application")
      WITH oword
         .Documents.ADD
         .Visible=.T.

         *-- Change the view type based upon the view type
         *-- used when Word was last used.
         IF .Activewindow.View.Splitspecial = wdpanenone      && wdpanenone=0
            .Activewindow.Activepane.View.Type = wdpageview   && wdpageview=3
         ELSE
            .Activewindow.View.Type = wdPrintPreview      && wdPrintPreview=4
         ENDIF
      ENDWITH
