TITLE   :HOWTO: Programmatically Scroll a Visual FoxPro Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Unlike the grid control, which has a scroll method that can be called to
programmatically scroll through the grid records, a form has no such method.

You must use the SetViewPort method to programmatically scroll a Visual FoxPro
6.0 form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample form programmatically scrolls using the Page Up and Page
Down keys:

   Sample Code

      PUBLIC oform
