SYMPTOMS
========

All of the selected fields are not available on a form that was created using
the Form Wizard with the "Scrolling Grid" option selected. The following dialog
box appears:

   selected, you might try one of the following:

   3. Increase the Maximum Design Area setting in the Options dialog.

In this particular instance, option 1 does not work.
