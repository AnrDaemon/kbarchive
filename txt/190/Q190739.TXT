The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Filter check box is selected in the Print Session properties, and no DLL
file is specified by the user, there is no error indicating that the DLL needs
to be entered when the user clicks OK to apply the configuration.

CAUSE
=====

The print session does not verify that a filter DLL is specified if the user
selects the Filter check box.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1, 3.0 Service Pack 2, 3.0 Service Pack 3, 4.0, and 4.0 Service
Pack 1. We are researching this problem in the SNA Server versions 2.X and 3.0,
and will post more information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is corrected by having the print session validate that the filter
DLL name is not empty. The following error message is displayed if the DLL is
not specified:

   "Print filtering is selected, but the filter DLL name is blank."

The following files have been updated:

   <snaroot>\system\snacfg.dll
   <snaroot>\system\snaadmin.dll
