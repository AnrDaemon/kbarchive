SUMMARY
=======

Administrators of Microsoft Exchange server 5 and higher have the ability to
reroute internet mail messages with the originating 821 header intact, or
rewritten to the site associated to the host where the IMS is homed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reroute by rewriting the RFC-821 RCPT TO: header, follow these steps:

1. Open the Properties page on the Internet Mail Service.

2. Click the Routing tab.

3. Click the "Reroute incoming SMTP mail" option.

4. Click Add.

5. After the Add E-mail Domain page opens, type the domain that you are
   rerouting for into the "E-mail sent to this domain:" box.

6. Select the "Should be rerouted to this domain:" option, and then type the
   domain you want to route to.

7. Click OK when you finish.

Example: If you want everything destined for "test.com" (user@test.com) to be
rerouted to "example.com", and you want the headers rewritten to
user@example.com, follow these steps:

1. On the Routing tab, select <Add...>, and then type "test.com" (without
   the quotation marks).

2. Select the "Should be routed to this domain"" button, and then type
   "example.com" (without the quotation marks).

To reroute while maintaining the RFC-821 RCPT TO: header, follow these steps:

1. Open the Properties page on the Internet Mail Service.

2. Select the Connections tab, and then click the <E-mail Domain> button.

3. Select Add.

4. After the "Add E-Mail Domain" page opens, type the domain that you are
   rerouting for into the E-Mail Domain: box.

5. Select the "Forward all messages for this domain to host:" option. Type the
   domain (or IP address) you want to route to.

6. Click OK when you finish.

NOTE: Do not add to the Routing page.

Example: If you want everything destined for "test.com" (user@test.com) to be
rerouted to "example.com" (or the IP address for "example.com") and you want the
headers to remain user@test.com, follow these steps:

1. On the Connections tab, select the <E-Mail Domain> domain button, and
   then add a new entry for "test.com."

2. Type the host name or IP address for the mail exchanger at "example.com" in
   "Forward all messages for this domain to host:".

Additional query words: routing forwarding rcpt to: rfc-821
