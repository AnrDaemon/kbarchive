TITLE   :Perl Script Mappings Converted to Uppercase During Upgrade
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When upgrading to Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, Perl script mappings,
which are case sensitive, are converted to uppercase.

Specifically, the "%s" string is converted to "%S" UPPERCASE (without the
quotation marks).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the "%S" text back to "%s" (without the
quotation marks). To do this, perform the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft Management Console, right-click your Internet Information
   Server name and click Properties on the shortcut menu.

2. In the Properties dialog box, click the Edit button next to Master
   Properties.

3. In the Application Settings section of the Home Directory tab, click
   Configuration.

4. Double-click the entry for the extension .PL to edit the Perl mapping.

5. In the Executable box, you will see a path followed by "%S %S" (note that %S
   is uppercase). For example, you will see something similar to:

      C:\perl\bin\perl.exe %S %S
  

6. Change %S %S to lowercase %s %s and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
