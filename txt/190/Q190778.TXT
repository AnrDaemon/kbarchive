 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to create a setup package for
a project and you include a remote server file (.vbr file) in the package, the
PDW automatically adds the .tlb file and Autprx32.dll to the list of files to be
included. This happens even though Autprx32.dll is needed for remote automation
only, not DCOM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually deselect Autprx32.dll in the Included Files dialog box to remove it
from the setup package.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
