TITLE   :BUG: Calling AsyncRead on a File Twice Causes Error 698
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the all of the following conditions are true:

 - You are calling AsyncRead on local files.

 - You are using the same value for the PropertyName argument.

 - You make the two calls successively.

the following error message is displayed:

   

   Error 698: PropertyName parameter conflicts with the PropertyName of
              an AsyncRead in progress

Because the AsyncRead is being performed on a local file, the download should be
happening synchronously. This means that it should be okay to issue AsyncRead
twice in succession.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you wish to force Synchronous download, use the AsyncReadOption:
"vbAsyncReadSynchronousDownload" in your call to AsyncRead.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
