TITLE   :BUG: RUN Command Hangs Form with WindowType=1 and Desktop=.T.
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You display a form with Desktop = .T. and WindowType = 1. The form issues a RUN
command that opens an MS-DOS box. When the MS-DOS box closes, the form appears
hung and will not accept keyboard or mouse input.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file. In order to demonstrate
   the behavior, you need to run it in such a way that the Command window is the
   only window open when the program is started. You can do this by issuing the
   code DO <Filename.prg> in the Command window, where the filename is the
   name of the program file into which you have saved the code below. The
   program depends on the existence of a file called Autoexec.bat in your "C:\"
   directory. You can create a dummy file there if this file does not exist, or
   you could have the program copy a different file if you wish.

         DEFINE CLASS form1 AS FORM
            TOP = 0
            LEFT = 0
            HEIGHT = 206
            WIDTH = 231
            DESKTOP = .T.
            CAPTION = "Form1"
            WINDOWTYPE = 1
            NAME = "Form1"

            ADD OBJECT command1 AS COMMANDBUTTON WITH ;
               TOP = 120, ;
               LEFT = 72, ;
               HEIGHT = 27, ;
               WIDTH = 84, ;
               CAPTION = "Run XCopy", ;
               NAME = "Command1"

            PROCEDURE command1.CLICK
               RUN /N xcopy c:\autoexec.bat c:\autoexec.bak
            ENDPROC

         ENDDEFINE

2. Click the "Run XCopy" button.

The MS-DOS box appears and disappears, and the form becomes deselected. The form
cannot get the focus and will not receive keyboard or mouse input. If you click
on the close box in the Visual FoxPro desktop, you will receive a "Cannot quit
FoxPro" message. Once this has occurred, the form will be accessible once again.
This does not happen with Desktop = .F. or with WindowType = 0 and a READ
EVENTS.
