-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to use the HTML version of the Internet Service Manager (also
known as the HTML Administration, or HTMLA) one of the following errors is
displayed in Internet Explorer:

   -1073741670(0xC0000098)
   -1073741670 (0xc000009a)

CAUSE
=====

Windows is unable to contact the domain controller in order to validate your
user session. This usually occurs when the connection to the domain controller
is lost.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reestablish the connection to the domain
controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although you can log on to Windows NT using cached permissions, Internet
Information Server (IIS) does not use them. IIS must communicate with the domain
controller in order to validate the account.
