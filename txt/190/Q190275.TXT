======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail (CCMC) to
connect to a cc:Mail postoffice version 8.x, the following error message may
appear:

   Event ID: 65
   Source: MSExchangeCCMC
   Type: Error
   Category: General
   Description:
   Lotus cc:Mail EXPORT to file msg423B.ccm failed to run.
   R0002 Resource file not found: C:\WINNT\IE.RI.

CAUSE
=====

This error message may be caused by the fact that the file IE.RI is missing or
is inaccessible.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, copy IE.RI to the same directory where you have
copied the Import.exe and Export.exe files. It is preferable to copy those three
files to the Winnt\System32 directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The file IE.RI is not required for cc:Mail postoffice version 6, which requires
only Import.exe version 5.15 and Export.exe version 5.14. You must select to use
Import 6.0/Export 6.0 versions, in the Post Office property page, to connect to
a cc:Mail postoffice version 8.x. In this case, Export.exe, Import.exe, and
IE.RI must be in the search path for the system.
