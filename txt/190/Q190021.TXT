TITLE   :XADM: Messages Sitting in IMS Inbound Queue Waiting Delivery
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On an Exchange Server computer that hosts a working Internet Mail Service
(Internet Mail Connector in version 4.0), after changing the "forward all
messages to host" IP address in the Connections\Message Delivery property page
of the IMS, inbound mail may start to sit in the Inbound Waiting Delivery queue
of the IMS and the administrator may start receiving the following
notifications:

   Internal processing error 4115. Message from the spool file J9QXJV0J
   (J9ZffVLD) seems to be looping through the routing extension of the
   Internet Mail Service (IMS). Please check that the routing DLL is
   configured properly.

The Administrator account, specified in the Internet Mail property page of the
Internet Mail Service, gets the following notification:

  From: System Administrator <postmaster@example.microsoft.com >
     To: Administrator <Administrator@example.microsoft.com >
     Subject: Notification: Inbound Mail Failure
     Date: Wednesday, April 30, 1997 1:25 PM
  
   The following recipients did not receive the attached mail. Reasons are
   listed with each recipient:

   <administrator@example.microsoft.com >
        administrator@example.microsoft.com
   MSEXCH:IMS:Org Name:Site Name:Server Name 0 (00120270) Too Many Hops
   <ddatsomo@example.microsoft.com > ddatsomo@example.microsoft.com
   MSEXCH:IMS:Org Name:Site Name:Server Name 0 (00120270) Too Many Hops

In Event Viewer, you might find the following error:

   Unable to submit, send, or transfer out a message. Check
      pr_recipient_number,
      pr_recipient_type, pr_report_time. From MSExchangeIS private.

Enabling and inspecting the SMTP protocol logging shows that the inbound messages
were successfully received.

CAUSE
=====

The Internet Mail Service may be configured to route mail to its own server.
There are two ways to work around this incorrect configuration.

WORKAROUND
==========

 - If you are selecting "Reroute incoming SMTP mail using POP3" in the Internet
   Mail Service Routing property page, then you must remove your own domain name
   from the routing table in this property page. Also you must stop both the
   Internet Mail Service and the MTA services, or better yet, restart the
   server. If you do not stop these two services and restart them, the SMTP
   routing changes will not take effect.

   If there are no POP3 clients connected to this Exchange Server computer,
   select the other option, "Do not route."

 - Check the Connected sites tab within the Property page of the IMS and remove
   any entries in this property page if this Internet Mail Service is not
   connecting to another Exchange Server site.
