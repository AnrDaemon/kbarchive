======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual C++ project settings can be lost if a project is terminated by any means
other than a normal exit. Loss of settings can result despite clicking OK after
making a change to a project setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid losing project settings, close the project before leaving the computer
for an extended period of time. Also, on the File menu, click Save All before
performing a task that could crash the machine.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The loss of project settings can occur on an abnormal termination of the
project, that could result from power loss or other reasons. This risk can be
minimized by closing the workspace before leaving the computer for an extended
period of time or by clicking Save All on the File menu before performing a task
that may cause the computer to crash.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual C++ Win32 Application project, give it a name, and click
   OK.

   NOTE: Depending on the version of Visual C++ in use, a wizard may supply
   additional dialog boxes. Provide appropriate responses to these dialog boxes.

2. On the Project menu, click Settings (in Visual C++ .NET, click Properties),
   and then select C/C++. In the Warning Level combo box, select a different
   level than the default level and click OK.

3. Terminate the project abnormally by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL to bring up the
   Task Manager in Windows NT or the Close Window dialog box in Windows 95 or
   Windows 98. Highlight the Visual C++ task and then click End Task.

   NOTE: Do not respond to a dialog box asking if changes are to be saved.
   Instead, click End Task in the dialog box that follows.

4. Start Visual C++ again and open the Visual C++ project that was just
   terminated abnormally.

5. On the Project menu, click Settings (in Visual C++ .NET, click Properties)
   and then click C/C++. The bug described in this article is demonstrated by
   the loss of the project setting change made earlier.

6. Verify the workaround by making another setting change: Click Save All on the
   File menu prior to abnormally terminating the project as described in step 3,
   and then repeat steps 4 and 5.
