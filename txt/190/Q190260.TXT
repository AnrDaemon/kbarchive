TITLE   :BUG: View Window Responds Incorrectly to Double-Click
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Double-clicking a table in the Alias window of the Data session dialog box (or
the View dialog box in Visual FoxPro 3.0x) does not always open a Browse window
for that table.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs when displaying more than ten tables with this dialog. If
the table appears in the middle of the list, double-clicking does not open the
Browse window. However, if the table appears at the top or the bottom of the
list, double-clicking does open a Browse window.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program that contains the following code and run the program:

         CREATE TABLE test (one c(10))
         INSERT INTO test VALUES ('hi there')

         FOR ii=1 TO 25
            COPY TO ('test'+ALLTRIM(STR(ii)))
            USE ('test'+ALLTRIM(STR(ii))) IN 0
         ENDFOR

         SET

2. Double-click Test4, which appears in the middle of the visible list of files.
   Note that the list jumps and you end up selecting a different table. The
   Browse window does not open. Similar behavior may happen when double-clicking
   tables in the list.

3. To delete all the tables created by the sample code, add the following code
   to a separate program file and run the program:

         CLOSE ALL
         DELETE FILE test.DBF
         FOR ii=1 TO 25
            DELETE FILE  ('test'+ALLTRIM(STR(ii)))+".dbf"
         ENDFOR
