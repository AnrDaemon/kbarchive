The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual Basic 6.0 Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) does not create an HTM
file for an ActiveX Document DLL project if the project contains DHTML Page
Designer or a WebClass.

RESOLUTION
==========

An HTM is created for ActiveX Document DLLs only when they do not contain DHTML
Page Designers or WebClasses.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Package and Deployment Wizard will not create an HTM file for an ActiveX
Document DLL project if the project contains DHTML Page Designer or a WebClass.
DHTML Page Designers or WebClasses have their own HTM/ASP files.
