OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Events Service in the Windows NT Control Panel
Services, the service does not start and the following error message occurs:

   Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Event Service service on
   <servername>
   Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

Also, the following event will be logged in the application log of the Event
Viewer:

   Event ID   : 5
   Source     : MSExchangeES
   Type       : Error
   Category   : General
   Description: An unexpected MAPI error occurred. Error returned
                was [0x80040107].

CAUSE
=====

One of the .dlls use by the Events Service is corrupt.

The EventConfig public folder for the server is invalid or there are multiple
copies of this public folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

Stop the Exchange Server services and copy the following DLLs from the original
Exchange Server 5.5 disc:

 - emsmdb32.dll

 - mapi32.dll

The location on the disc is: Server\Setup\<Platform>

In case there are multiple copies of the EventConfig public folder for this
server, following the steps in the following article to get rid of the duplicate
public folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MAPI error 0x80040107 is "Invalid EntryID." Removing and reinstalling the Events
Service will not resolve this issue because those files will not be replaced
with the originals.

Other files included in the Events Service program include the following:

 - Events.exe

 - Eventmsg.dll

 - Esconf.dll

 - Ss.dll

 - Scripto.dll

 - Exflow.dll
