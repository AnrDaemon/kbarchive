SYMPTOMS

When viewing the storage limit column on mailbox resources for a directory
replication bridgehead server, you may see the directory service mailbox go into
a "prohibit send" state.

The following events are also logged in the application event log:

CAUSE
=====

There is a prohibit send limit configured against the private information store.
The directory service mailbox has exceeded the limit applied to the private
information store.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, clear the prohibit send limit on the information
store of the directory replication bridgehead server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5.
