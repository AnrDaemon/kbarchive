TITLE   :PRB: PACK May Cause the File Name to Change Case
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The file name of a FoxPro table changes case after a PACK command has been
issued to the file name case that is specified in the USE statement.

If the Windows Explorer file name was "test.dbf" (lower case, without the
quotation marks) prior to opening the table and "USE Test.dbf" was issued to
open the table, the Windows Explorer file name will be "Test.dbf" after a PACK
is issued.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the desired file name case when issuing a USE statement.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

With Explorer open to the directory where the .dbf file will be created, run the
following code:

         CLOSE DATA ALL
         ERASE test.DBF
         CLEAR
         CREATE TABLE TeSt (c c(10)) &&The file name will be "TeSt"
         FOR i = 1 TO 10
            INSERT INTO test VALUES("test"+PADL(ALLTRIM(STR(i)),3,"0"))
         ENDFOR
         WAIT WINDOW "Please wait" TIME 10
         USE test && Opening the table with a different case filename.
         DELETE FOR RECNO()>7
         PACK && After the PACK, the filename will be the same as in the
              && USE command.
         USE
         ERASE test.DBF

NOTE: The file name case changes to that used in the USE statement.
