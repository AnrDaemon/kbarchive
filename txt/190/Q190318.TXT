KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating an index using the BINTOC() function, with the COLLATE set to
GENERAL, the following error occurs:

   Uniqueness of index <index name> is violated.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you create an index using BINTOC, use "SET COLLATE TO MACHINE". In
addition, when you create an index based on a NOCPTRANS field (binary character
field), use "SET COLLATE TO MACHINE" or the same problem described earlier
occurs.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the following sample code:

      CREATE TABLE test (id I, other I)
      FOR lni = 1 TO 10
         INSERT INTO test (id ) VALUE (lni)
      ENDFOR
      SET COLLATE TO ""
      INDEX ON BINTOC(id) TAG id CANDIDATE  && Index successful.
      SET COLLATE TO "GENERAL"
      INDEX ON BINTOC(id) TAG idG CANDIDATE && Index fails.

The last line of code fails with the error message described previously.
