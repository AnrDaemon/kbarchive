TITLE   :XFOR: Connector for cc:Mail Doesn't Support Long File Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange user sends a message with an attachment that has a long file
name (Longfilename.txt, for example) to a cc:Mail recipient using the 32-bit
cc:Mail client, the attachment name is shortened to 8.3 format (Longfi~1.txt).

However, when sending an attachment with a long file name from the 32-bit cc:Mail
client to Exchange, the attachment's long file name is retained.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail (CCMC) converts long file
name attachments to 8.3 format to support older 16-bit clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange versions 5.0
and 5.5.
