TITLE   :XFOR: Removing Connectors After Applying Exchange 5.5 SP1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


After you install Exchange Server 5.5 SP1, you cannot perform a "Remove All" to
uninstall connectors that were previously installed by the Exchange Connectivity
Setup application. Performing a "Remove All" does not remove the connector
files. The Notes, SNADS, and OfficeVision/VM connectors are the only connectors
affected by this behavior.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Exchange connectors for Notes, SNADS, and OfficeVision/VM included in the
Microsoft Exchange Connectivity package are installed from the Exchange Server
5.5 CD \Server\Exchconn directory. The connectors are updated from \Exchconn
directories on the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 CD.

To uninstall any of these connectors from an Exchange Server computer, perform
the following steps:

1. Click Start, click Programs, and then click Microsoft Exchange Connectivity.
   Click Setup.

2. On the Exchange Connectivity Setup application, select "Uninstall Microsoft
   Exchange Connectivity Software", and then follow the instructions provided.
