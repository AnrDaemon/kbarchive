TITLE   :PRB: DATE() Returns a DateTime Type Value From OLE Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The DATE() function returns a data type of Time when evaluated from an OLE
Server or COM object. This behavior is by design because the Date data type is
converted to an OLE variant type during the evaluation.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround to this behavior is to convert the return value via the TTOD
(Time to Date) function, for example:

      ?TYPE('TTOD(_VFP.EVAL("DATE()"))') && This returns "T" for Time

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, issue the following:

         ?TYPE('DATE()')              && This returns "D" for Date
         ?TYPE("_VFP.EVAL('DATE()')") && This returns "T" for Time

NOTE: In the example above, the return value from the second line is the same
that you would get from any COM object created in Visual FoxPro.
