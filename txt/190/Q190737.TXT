======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Setting a maximum message size limit on the Exchange Message Transfer Agent
(MTA) does not prevent Exchange Server public folder replication messages from
being sent to other Exchange Server computers if the size of the replication
message surpasses the message size limit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Public folder replication messages are considered "system" messages. Therefore
the size limits set on the MTA do not prevent these messages from being
delivered to other servers containing public folder replicas.

Additional query words: pf replica ndr
