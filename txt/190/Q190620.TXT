TITLE   :PRB: Error 3622 Open SQL Server Table with Identity Column
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbATLComposite kbDatabase kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVBDB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a Dynaset in Visual Data Manager (or Visual Basic sample
project VisData) against a Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 table that contains an
Identity column, you may receive the following error message:

   Error 3622 - You must use the dbSeeChanges option with OpenRecordset when
   accessing a SQL Server table that has an IDENTITY column.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, set the Options property for the data control to
dbSeeChanges (512). To change the Options property on a data control to the
proper value, use one of the following two methods:

 - In the design environment, make sure that the data control is the selected
   item on your form. Then, go to the properties sheet, and set the Options
   property to 512.

 - In the run-time environment, use the following line of code to set the
   Options property of a data control named data1:

   data1.options = dbSeeChanges

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You need to recompile VisData.vbp, create a new VisData.exe, and then copy it to
the VisualBasic default folder.

You can modify the VisData sample to avoid the error. There are two places that
you need to make the changes: where you open a recordset from the Database
Window, and where you execute a SQL statement.

1. In VISDATA.BAS, under the OpenTable() function, change:

      Set rsTmp=gdbCurrentDB.OpenRecordset(rName, dbOpenDynaset)

   -to-

      Set rsTmp=gdbCurrentDB.OpenRecordset(rName,dbOpenDynaset, dbSeeChanges)

2. In VISDATA.BAS, under the OpenQuery() function, change:

      Set rsTmp = qdfTmp.OpenRecordset(dbOpenDynaset)

   -to-

      Set rsTmp = qdfTmp.OpenRecordset(dbOpenDynaset, dbSeeChanges)

3. After Making Changes to VISDATA.BAS, recompile the VISDATA project and copy
   the compiled executable to the Visual Basic directory (which is \Program
   Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vb98 by default in Visual Basic 6.0)

NOTE: There may be other areas of VisData code that would require changes based
on which part of the VisData Tool you are using.
For testing purposes, table IColTest is created in Pubs database with one
Identity column and one VarChar column. To create a table and index in SQL
Server, select Pubs database, then place the following Create Table T-SQL in the
SQL window of ISQL/W and execute it:

      Create Table IColTest
              (Id_Col int Identity, Name VarChar(30) Null)
      Create Unique Index IIndex on IColTest(Id_Col)
