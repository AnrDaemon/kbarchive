TITLE   :Memory Leak when Reading Configuration File
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Memory leaks occur each time the configuration file is opened and closed. Memory
leaks occur each time SNA Server Manager is used to view or to change the
configuration for the SNA Server sub-domain.

The memory leaks can affect two components of SNA Server: the SNA Manager and
SnaBase. The leak will be very small for SNA Manager. Each time the Manager is
stopped and restarted, the memory is recovered. The leak is evident only if a
sub-domain is closed and reopened without restarting SNA Manager.

SnaBase can be affected if frequent changes are made to the configuration. Each
time a change is written to the Config file, SnaBase must read the file.
Therefore, a small memory leak will occur each time a change is made. If SnaBase
is stopped and restarted, the memory is recovered

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
and 4.0 SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
