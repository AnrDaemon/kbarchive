======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual Basic Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) does not automatically
include or prompt the user about whether an ActiveX control's License should be
included in a distribution set.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the License for an ActiveX control developed in Visual Basic is to be
included in a distribution set, the License must be added manually through the
Package and Deployment Wizard. The appropriate VBL file must be included in the
distribution and the setup needs to know to register the VBL file on the target
machine.
