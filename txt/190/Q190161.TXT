TITLE   :TCP/IP Device Driver Doesn't Remember Endpoint Share Flags
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The TCP/IP device driver used in Windows NT and in Terminal Server does not
remember share flags of previously opened endpoints. Even if the previous
endpoint is opened exclusively, another application can open the same endpoint
with share flags, and capture all network traffic.

The problem is in TCP/IP and is applicable to all variants of Windows NT,
including Terminal Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no resolution at this time.

STATUS
======

A fix should be available for Windows NT 4.0 in Service Pack 4. It has not yet
been determined if that fix will be applicable to Terminal Server.
