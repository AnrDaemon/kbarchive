TITLE   :PRB: Negative Numbers Do Not Display in a Combo Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a combo box has the RowSourceType set to SQL Statement and the BoundTo
property is set to true, negative numeric values do not display in the combo
box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the RowSourceType property is set to any other value, negative numbers will
display in the combo box. Also, if the BoundTo property is set to false,
negative numbers will display in the combo box, but the positive value of that
number is written to the table.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Save the following code to a program file and run it to create a table named
   "test" with a numeric field called "numfld".

         CREATE TABLE test (numfld N(3))
         INSERT INTO test (numfld) VALUES (1)
         INSERT INTO test (numfld) VALUES (2)
         INSERT INTO test (numfld) VALUES (-1)
         INSERT INTO test (numfld) VALUES (-2)

2. Create a form, add the table to the Data Environment, and add a combo box to
   the form.

3. Change the following properties of the combo box:

         BoundTo = .T.
         ControlSource = numfld
         RowSource = SELECT * FROM test INTO CURSOR mytest
         RowSourceType = SQL Statement

4. Run the form and select a negative number from the drop-down combo box. Note
   that once a negative number is selected, it does not display in the combo
   box.
