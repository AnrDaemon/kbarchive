TITLE   :BUG: DHTML Page Designer Does Not Insert the <HTML> Tag
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInternet kbPageDesigner kbVBp kbVBp600bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

1. The browser incorrectly displays your HTML page.

2. Unexpected behavior occurs when you work on your page in the designer window
   of your DHTML application.

CAUSE
=====

DHTML Page Designer is not inserting an <HTML> tag at the beginning of the
HTML file it creates.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following three options:

Option 1
--------

Store your DHTML Page Designer page as an external HTML file. Edit the HTML file
manually using an external editor and insert the <HTML> tag.

Option 2
--------

Import an existing HTML file when creating a new DHTML Page Designer page.

Option 3
--------

Change the default DHTML Page Designer template so all HTML files have the
<HTML> tag. The template project is "DHTML application.vbp". This project
is stored under the Visual Studio folder in the VB98\Template\Projects
subfolder.

NOTE: Save copies of all the files for the "DHTML application.vbp" (this is the
default DHTML Page Designer template) in a backup location in case something
goes wrong. Follow these steps:

1. Open the "DHTML application.vbp" project in Visual Basic.

2. Open the DHTMLPage1 Properties dialog box.

3. Select "Save the HTML as an External file".

4. Select "Create new HTML file".

5. Launch the external editor to edit this HTML page.

6. Delete the two lines with <HTML> and <HEAD> tags (there seems to
   be a corrupted character on one of them).

7. Retype the <HTML> and <HEAD> tags.

8. Open the DHTMLPage1 Properties dialog box.

9. Select "Save HTML as part of the VB project".

10. Select the File menu item and save both the DHTMLPage1.dsr file and
   DHTMLPage1.vbp file
