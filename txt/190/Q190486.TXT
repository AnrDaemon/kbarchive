KEYWORDS:kbdocerr kbref kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation for CToolBar::SetButtonStyle includes the following styles:
TBBS_BUTTON, TBBS_SEPARATOR, TBBS_CHECKBOX, TBBS_GROUP, and, TBBS_CHECKGROUP.

The following styles are missing: TBBS_DROPDOWN, TBBS_AUTOSIZE, TBBS_NOPREFIX.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is the information for the missing styles:

TBBS_DROPDOWN
-------------

Creates a drop-down list button.

TBBS_AUTOSIZE
-------------

The button's width is calculated based on the text of the button, not on the size
of the image.

TBBS_NOPREFIX
-------------

The button text does not have an accelerator prefix associated with it.

NOTE: CToolBar uses the underlying CToolBarCtrl common control. These styles have
the same effect for CToolBar as the TBSTYLE flags have for the toolbar common
control. More information about these styles can be found in the toolbar common
control documentation.
