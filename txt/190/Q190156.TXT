SUMMARY
=======

If you are using the Citrix ICA client with Terminal Server, you can select a
callback number for dial-in clients either in Terminal Server Connection
Configuration or in User Manager. If the administrator selects a fixed number
for callback, however, the user interface allows you to close the dialog box
even if you entered no phone number. When users dial in, they get a dialog that
tells them to contact their system administrator, because the dial back number
has not been set. While this situation is an annoyance, it poses no security
risk. To fix the situation, turn off the callback feature or enter a phone
number.
