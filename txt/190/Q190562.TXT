Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following from a program file:

         PUBL OF1,OF2
         OF1 = CREA("form1")
         OF1.SHOW

         OF2 = CREATEOBJECT("form2")
         OF2.LEFT = _SCREEN.LEFT+OF2.LEFT+OF1.WIDTH+12
         OF2.TOP = _SCREEN.TOP+75
         OF2.SHOW

         DEFINE CLASS FORM1 AS FORM
            SHOWWINDOW = 0
            HEIGHT = 50
            WIDTH = 200
            ADD OBJECT TEXT1 AS TEXTBOX WITH ;
               TOP = 10, ;
               LEFT = 10, ;
               WIDTH = 150

          PROC INIT
            THIS.CAPTION = "ShowWindow = "+STR(THIS.SHOWWINDOW,1)
            THISFORM.TEXT1.SELECTEDFORECOLOR=RGB(255,0,0)
            THISFORM.TEXT1.SELECTEDBACKCOLOR=RGB(0,255,0)
            THISFORM.TEXT1.VALUE = ;
               STR(THISFORM.TEXT1.SELECTEDBACKCOLOR)+ ;
               " "+STR(THISFORM.TEXT1.SELECTEDFORECOLOR)
            THISFORM.TEXT1.SELSTART=0
            THISFORM.TEXT1.SELLENGTH=LEN(THISFORM.TEXT1.VALUE)
            THISFORM.TEXT1.HIDESELECTION = .F.
          ENDPROC
         ENDDEFINE

         DEFINE CLASS FORM2 AS FORM1
            SHOWWINDOW = 2
         ENDDEFINE

The Top-Level form (where ShowWindow = 2) displays the selected text as white
foreground on a blue background. The form where ShowWindow = 0 displays the
selected text as red foreground on bright green background. The edit box and
combo box controls display the same behavior.
