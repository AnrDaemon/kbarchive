SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to install floppy enabler drivers for a Conner 2 megabits per
second (Mbps) Integrated Device Electronics (IDE) controller by following the
steps in the Readme.txt file located in the Drvlib\Storage\Fenb\Conner folder on
the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM, you may receive the following error message after you
retype the path to the Drvlib folder in step 5:

   Please insert the disk labeled: 'Generic FDC Driver Disk' into <CD-ROM
   drive letter>

When you click OK, you receive the error message again.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, follow these steps:

1. Copy the files from the Drvlib\Storage\Fenb\Conner folder on the Windows NT
   4.0 CD-ROM to a floppy disk.

   For information about how to copy files, click Start, click Help, click the
   Index tab, type "copying" (without quotation marks), and then click the
   "Files" topic.

2. Follow the steps in the Readme.txt file again, but in step 4, select the
   floppy disk that contains the drivers you copied.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) states that drivers for the
Conner 2 Mbps IDE controller are located in the Drvlib\Storage\Fenb\Conner
folder on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.
