-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you set up a delegate for your mailbox, you may receive the following error
message:

   Unable to forward meeting-related messages. Choose Inbox Assistant or Rules
   Wizard, remove some rules, and try again. Unable to modify folder rule.

This message occurs if you uncheck the option "Delegate receives copies of
meeting-related messages sent to me" in the Delegate Permissions or if you
select "None" in the Calendar selection option box for Delegate Permissions.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The message occurs because no delegates have been designated
to receive meeting-related messages.

This message will only occur under the following conditions:

 - No rules of any kind have been created for the users mailbox.

 - The checkbox "Delegate receives copies of meeting-related messages sent to
   me" must be unchecked for all delegates.

 - The user then selects OK or Apply after unchecking the above option.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this message, you can create at least one rule for your mailbox or
select a delegate to receive meeting-related messages.
