KEYWORDS:kbActiveX kbide kbOSWinNT400fix kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running an ActiveX DLL application where a procedure has the
MTSTransactionMode property set to UsesTransaction, the following error occurs
the first time the application is run:

   You have set the MTSTransactionMode property for one or more Classes in your
   project(s), but Microsoft Transaction Server is not installed or is the wrong
   version. This feature requires Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or later.
   MTS functionality will be disabled. Do you want to run anyway?

Any subsequent runnings of the application do not generate the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

This error occurs when Windows NT SP4 or later has not been installed, or when
Windows NT Option Pack 4.0 was installed after the installation of Windows NT
SP4 or later. To resolve this problem you should reapply Windows NT SP4 or
later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
This problem has been resolved in Windows NT SP4.
