TITLE   :XFOR: Connector for cc:Mail Converts Messages Larger Than 20 KB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail has added functionality. This
connector now takes a message body larger than 20 KB and converts it to an
attachment with the name Unnamed.txt. This allows customers with large
deployments to modify the server rather than reconfigure each desktop. Prior to
the new functionality, the cc:Mail side converted the message body to an
attachment, but the attachment did not have an association. This meant that
users could not double-click the attachment and cause it to open automatically.
This change primarily affects the Macintosh cc:Mail clients. Newer Windows
versions of the cc:Mail clients correctly handle large message bodies.
