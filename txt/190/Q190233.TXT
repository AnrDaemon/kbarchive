   service terminated with service-specific error 3221487623.

CAUSE

The Terminal Server Licensing service is unable to access hydra.mdb. The file is
missing or has become corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following steps to resolve this problem:

1. Using Windows NT Explorer, go to the directory where Windows Terminal server
   was installed. Click System32 and then click Lserver. (the default location
   is \WTSRV\system32\lserver) Rename hydra.mdb to Hydra.old

2. From the Windows NT Terminal Server CD-ROM, expand hydra.md_ to hydra.mdb
   into the lserver directory. For example: Expand E:\i386\hydra.md_
   c:\WTSRV\system32\lserver\hydra.mdb Where "E:" is the CD-ROM drive letter.

3. Start the Terminal Server Licensing service

-or-

Check the following in Control Panel:

1. Click Control Panel and then select ODBC.

2. Click on the System DSN tab.

3. Ensure the Name is "Hydra License". It should be exactly as it is in quotes.
   Driver should be Microsoft Access Drive (*.mdb). Verify that the driver
   points to the right database file. License server setup will set this to
   %systemroot%\system32\lserver\hydra.mdb.

If the name and driver are different, please change to the above.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
