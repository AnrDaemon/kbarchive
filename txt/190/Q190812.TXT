TITLE   :Briefcase Item Needs to Be Synchronized Twice
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Briefcase folder, and a file in it has the synchronized copy on a
Windows NT network share.

When you modify the file in the local folder, and synchronize it with the server
copy, the synchronization status still shows, "Needs updating." When you
synchronize it again, Briefcase offers to copy the file from the remote
location, although the file time stamp is identical.

After Briefcase copies the file from the remote location, the synchronization
status is correctly set to "Up-to-date."

CAUSE
=====

After Briefcase copies the file to the server during the first update, it uses
FindFirstFile to read back the file information. In some cases, the LAN Manager
redirector runs this API before the file is closed. If this happens, the file
size of the remote file is not correct and the synchronization status is not set
correctly.

In a network trace, you can see a frame sequence like this between the client and
server:

   SMB       C write, FID = 0x9804, Write 0x0 at 0x0000020E
   SMB       R write, Wrote 0x0
   SMB       C transact2 Set file info, FID = 0x9804
   SMB       R transact2 Set file info (response)
   SMB       C transact2 Findfirst, File = \Text2.txt
   SMB       R transact2 Findfirst (response)
   SMB       C close file, FID = 0x9804
   SMB       R close file

In response to the Findfirst server message block (SMB), you will see an
incorrect file size.
