SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message with an attachment to a PROFS user through the LinkAge
PROFS Connector or Exchange PROFS Connector, the file name may be modified if it
contains a $ (dollar sign) character. For example, if you send a message with an
attached file, where the file has the name TEST._$_, the file name is modified
by the connector to TEST.__. The $ character is removed from the name.

CAUSE
=====

The LinkAge PROFS Connector and Exchange PROFS Connector do not allow "$"
characters in file names of attachments.
