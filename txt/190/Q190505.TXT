If you pass a variable of type Double as a single argument to a sub or function,
you may get the following error when you run the project in the design
environment:

   Run-time error "6" Overflow

However, when you compile the project and run it as a standalone executable, no
overflow error is reported.

STATUS

information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Paste the following code into the code window of Form1:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Dim v As Double
            v = CDbl(3.1E+50)
            Test v
         End Sub

         Sub Test(ByVal X As Single)
            MsgBox X
         End Sub

3. Press the F5 key to run the project. You get the following error message:

   Run-time error "6" Overflow

4. Compile the executable by clicking File, Make Project1.exe.

5. Run the executable. Note that no overflow error is reported. Instead it
   prints out "1#.INF."
