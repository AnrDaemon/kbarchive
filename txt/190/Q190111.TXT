TITLE   :FIX: In Grid, 2nd Character Overwrites 1st If Old Value Is NULL
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Typing numeric data greater than one digit in length into a grid's textbox where
the original value of the column's ControlSource is NULL and the column.Sparse =
.F., causes the second character to overwrite the first character.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. This
bug is fixed in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

         PUBLIC oform1
         CREA TABLE nulltest (f1 N(10,2) NULL)
         FOR lni = 1 TO 5
            INSERT INTO nulltest VALUES (.NULL.)
         ENDFOR
         USE nulltest

         oform1=CREATEOBJECT("form1")
         oform1.SHOW
         RETURN

         DEFINE CLASS form1 AS FORM

            TOP = 0
            LEFT = 0
            HEIGHT = 268
            WIDTH = 378
            CAPTION = "Form1"
            NAME = "Form1"

            ADD OBJECT grd1 AS GRID WITH ;
               COLUMNCOUNT = 1, ;
               LEFT = 33, ;
               RECORDSOURCE = "nulltest", ;
               RECORDSOURCETYPE = 1, ;
               TOP = 28, ;
               NAME = "grd1", ;
               Column1.SPARSE = .F., ;
               Column1.NAME = "Column1"
         ENDDEFINE

2. Type in 25, then press the DOWN ARROW key.

RESULTS: The 2 appears, then is overwritten by the 5, and the text box value is
5.00 after you press the DOWN ARROW key. This does not happen if the grid Sparse
property is .T. rather than .F., or if the field value is not NULL.
