TITLE   :PRB: Form QueryUnload Fires Before the Activate Event
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b,5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, the QueryUnload event of a form fires before the
Activate event. If code in the Activate event of a form takes some time to
execute, the QueryUnload event fires before the code in the Activate event.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add the following code to the Activate event of the form:

         ? "Inside the Activate event."
         *DEBUGOUT PROGRAM()
         FOR i = 1 TO 5000
               SET MESSAGE TO ALLTRIM(STR(i))
         NEXT i

2. Add the following code to the QueryUnload event of the form:

         ? "Inside the QueryUnload event."
         *DEBUGOUT PROGRAM()
         WAIT WINDOW "Inside the QueryUnload Event."

3. Run the form and click the Command window to remove focus from the form. Now,
   click the Close control to close the form. Notice that the Activate event
   fires, then the QueryUnload event fires.

4. Unremark the two DEBUGOUT commands and remark the WAIT WINDOW command. Open
   the Debugger and note that in the Output window of the Debugger the
   QueryUnload event fires after the Activate event.
