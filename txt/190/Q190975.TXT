TITLE   :FIX: Delete Files from Project Doesn't Update IntelliSense
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVC600bug kbNoUpdate

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When files are deleted from a project, IntelliSense continues to recognize the
functions and classes that the removed file contained.

CAUSE
=====

When a file is removed, none of the functions or classes are removed from
IntelliSense's "memory."

RESOLUTION
==========

To have IntelliSense remove these functions and classes, close the project
workspace, and delete the project's .ncb file. When the project is reopened in
Visual C++, the .ncb file will be re-created with the correct information.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In a Visual C++ project, click New on the File menu.

2. On the Files tab, select C/C++ Header file.

3. Name the new file Test.h.

4. In Test.h type the following text:

         class CTest
         {
         public :
            void MyTest(){}
         }

5. In the FileView pane, select Test.h and press the DEL key. Test.h is now
   removed from the project.

6. In another source file, type the following:

         CTest test;
         test.

Notice that the Members list for the test object displays, even though the class
definition has been removed by deleting the file.
