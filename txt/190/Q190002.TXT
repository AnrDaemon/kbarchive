CGI and Perl applications do not run in a new console.

WORKAROUND
==========

With the Windows Script Host enabled, start the command prompt and go to the
following directory:

   <%System_Root%>\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples

Then, type the following command:

   adsutil set w3svc/CreateCGIWithNewConsole "1"

MORE INFORMATION
================

To run CGI applications in Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 and earlier,
"CreateProcessWithNewConsole" was added as a REG_DWORD with a value of "1" to
the following registry key:
