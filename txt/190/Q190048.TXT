Page Designer: Modal Prompts Appear Behind Browser in Run Mode
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you add a message box to your DHTML page, the message box appears behind
Internet Explorer when activated in run mode. In addition, you cannot move
Internet Explorer out of the way in order to view the message, because the
message is modal. When you hear the beep that indicates a message is on the
screen, select the Visual Basic application from your taskbar to view and clear
the message.
