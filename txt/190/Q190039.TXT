SYMPTOMS
========

If you multi-select three or more controls on a form using either the CTRL key
or SHIFT key and then deselect one of the controls with the Properties window
closed in the integrated development environment (IDE), VB6.exe crashes.

NOTE: This problem does not occur if the Properties window is open.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, open the Properties window. You can open the
Properties window by pressing the F4 key or clicking on the Properties Window in
the View menu in the VB6 IDE.

STATUS
======

beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. On Form1 place a TextBox (Text1), a CommandButton (Command1), and an
   OptionButton (Option1). (It does not matter which three controls you use.)

3. Close the Properties window by either clicking the "X" in the upper-right
   corner of the Properties window, or right-clicking the Properties window and
   selecting Hide.

4. Hold down the Shift key and select the three controls with the mouse.

5. Deselect one of the controls by holding the Shift key down and clicking on
   one of the selected controls.

This will produce a crash in VB6.exe. Typical error messages that might appear
are:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   Generated.

-or-

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
