TITLE   :XADM: Eseutil Fails with JetDuplicateKey Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Eseutil /p on a corrupted database, the utility fails to complete
with a Jet_errKeyDuplicate error.

CAUSE
=====

There is a page in the database where the nodes are out of order and duplicated.
Eseutil does not detect this and tries to incorporate the page into the database
during repair. The database in question was corrupted by a faulty RAID Array
writing bad data over a period of time. This causes node shuffling and key
duplication that is undetected by Eseutil.exe reporting as Jet_errKeyDuplicate
error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

version 5.5.
