TITLE   :SMS: "Couldn't Connect to SQL Server" Error Reusing Login IDs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to start the Systems Management Server Administrator program you
may receive the following error message:

   Couldn't connect to SQL Server. The server may be down or configured
   incorrectly.

This problem is independent of the version of SQL Server being used, and it can
occur with all types of SQL Server security: standard, integrated, or mixed.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur when using a SQL Server login ID that had previously been
deleted. The newly re-created login ID is being used to access the SMS database.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the Systems Management Server Security Manager
to remove permissions to this account and then add them back in.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When deleting the original SQL Server login ID from the SQL Server, you can
avoid this problem of reusing it later by also running the following SQL query
to delete the ID from the SMS database, where <SQL_Login> is the SQL
Server login ID that you want to remove:

      use SMS
      delete from SecurityObjAccessList where username = '<SQL_login>'
