TITLE   :BUG: AddProperty Fails With Initial Value of Type Currency
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you call the AddProperty method of an object and pass an initial value of
type currency, you may receive the following error when the AddProperty
executes:

   Unrecognized command verb.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, you can pass the initial value as a named
expression or pass a variable containing the initial value, as follows:

      oCst.AddProperty("currencyvalue",($0))

NOTE: Note the added parentheses around the currency value.

   -or-

      yCurVal = $0
      oCst.AddProperty("currencyvalue", yCurVal)

NOTE: The initial value is passed as a variable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AddProperty() method takes two parameters. The first parameter is the name
for the added property, and the second parameter is the value of the newly added
property.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following in the Command window:

         oCst = NEWOBJECT("custom")
         oCst.AddProperty("currencyvalue",$0)

RESULTS: The error "Unrecognized command verb" occurs.

1. The following code works without error:

         * Pass as named expression.
         oCst.AddProperty("currencyvalue",($0))

   -or-

         * Pass as variable.
         yCurVal = $0
         oCst.AddProperty("currencyvalue", yCurVal)
