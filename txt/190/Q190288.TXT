TITLE   :SecHole Lets Non-administrative Users Gain Debug Level Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A utility, Sechole.exe, is being circulated on the Internet that performs a very
sophisticated set of steps that allows a non-administrative user to gain
debug-level access on a system process. Using this utility, the non-
administrative user is able to run some code in the system security context and
thereby grant himself or herself local administrative privileges on the system.

CAUSE
=====

Sechole.exe locates the memory address of a particular API function
(OpenProcess) and modifies the instructions at that address in a running image
of the exploit program on the local system. Sechole.exe requests debug rights
that gives it elevated privileges. The request is successful because the access
check for this right is expected to be done in the API that was successfully
modified by the exploit program. Sechole.exe can now add the user who invoked
Sechole.exe to the local Administrators group.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT version
4.0. For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.

   TITLE : How To Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


While this hotfix is included with Service Pack 4, it is also available
individually. This hotfix ensures that the access check to grant any rights is
done by the server and not the client. This fix has been posted as Privfixi.exe
(x86) and Privfixa.exe (Alpha). For your convenience, the English version of
this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location.
However, Microsoft recommends that you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to
correct this problem.

Windows NT 3.51
---------------

Microsoft has confirmed this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT version 3.51. A fully supported fix is now
available, but it has not been fully regression tested and should only be
applied to systems determined to be at risk of attack. Please evaluate your
system's physical accessibility, network and Internet connectivity, and other
factors to determine the degree of risk to your system. If your system is
sufficiently at risk, Microsoft recommends you download the fix as described
below and apply this fix.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This exploit can potentially allow a non-administrative user to gain local
administrative access to the system and thereby elevate his or her privileges on
the system. To perform this attack, the user has to have a valid local account
on the system and has to have physical access to the computer to log on locally
to the system.

Sensitive systems, such as the Windows NT domain controllers where non-
administrative users do not have any local log on rights by default, are not
susceptible to this threat. The attack cannot be used over the network to get
domain administrative privileges remotely.
