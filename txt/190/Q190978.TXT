TITLE   :PRB: Missing Dependency Information Dialog in PDW
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbwizard kbAppSetup kbInternet kbVBp kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a setup program with the Visual Basic Package and Deployment
Wizard (PDW), the following message is received:

   Missing Dependency Information

Below is a list of files for which dependency information could not be found. To
proceed without the dependency information for the file(s), click OK. To
permanently mark a file as having no dependencies, select its checkbox.

This article describes why this warning is received.

CAUSE
=====

The project includes a component such as the Microsoft Script Control 1.0
(MSSCRIPT.OCX), which does not have a .dep file and has no pertinent information
in VB6DEP.INI.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the case of a control such as MSSCRIPT.OCX, which does not need any
additional files to be distributed with it, the message regarding "Missing
Dependency Information" may be safely ignored.

If the component does require additional files for distribution, obtain a
dependency file for it and re-run the Package and Deployment Wizard.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Package and Deployment Wizard checks for component dependency information in
both the VB6DEP.INI and in the directory where the component is located.
Dependency information (.dep) files list the files required for a component to
run correctly.

If the PDW does not find any dependency information for a component, the Missing
Dependency Information dialog is displayed. You can check the box next to the
file name to prevent the dialog from displaying in subsequent runs of the PDW
script.

If the component was created in Visual Basic, the Package and Deployment Wizard
can be used to create a dependency file. If the component was obtained from a
third-party source, contact the source for a dependency file.

REFERENCES
==========

If a dependency file needs to be created manually for the component, please see
the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
