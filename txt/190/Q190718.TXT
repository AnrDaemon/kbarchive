TITLE   :WD97: Invalid Page Fault in Module Unknown Opening HTML Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,4.01,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) document in Word, you may
receive the following error message:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
   problem persists, contact the program vendor.

When you click Details, the following error message is displayed:

   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module <unknown> at
   0000:00000013.

CAUSE
=====

The HTML document may contain a virtual path deeper than two folder levels. For
example, if you open the HTML document in Microsoft Internet Explorer and view
the source of the HTML document, you may find a virtual path to a graphic file
similar to the following:

   <IMG SRC="../../ms.jpg">

To view the source of the document in Internet Explorer, click Source on the View
menu.

This behavior occurs because the version of Distributed Component Object Model
(DCOM) that is installed by Internet Explorer version 4.0 or 4.01 is unable to
correctly parse a virtual path that is two or more folder levels deep.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Explorer
versions 4.0 and 4.01 for Windows 95.




MORE INFORMATION
================

DCOM is a protocol that enables software components to communicate directly over
a network in a reliable, secure, and efficient manner. Previously called
"Network OLE," COM is designed for use across multiple network transports,
including Internet protocols such as HTTP. COM is based on the Open Software
Foundation's DCE- RPC spec and will work with both Java applets and ActiveX
components through its use of the Component Object Model (COM).
