TITLE   :Unattended NT Option Pack Installation Ignores Some Parameters
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Option Pack 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack in unattended mode,
several parameters documented in Unattend.txt do not work:

 - Components are copied to their default locations no matter what you specify.

   a. CiCatalogPath in section [indexsrv]: Catalog is created under
      inetpub\Catalog.wci.

   b. PathPROGRoot in section [iis]: IIS 4.0 components are copied to
      %windir%\system32\inetsrv.

 - Drivers are installed although you specified that they not be installed. For
   example, if you set DAC_DRV_SQLSRV = OFF, the SQL ODBC driver is nevertheless
   installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack manually and choose Custom Mode
to set the parameters as needed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack
version 1.0.
