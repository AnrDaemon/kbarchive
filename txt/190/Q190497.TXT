KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Selected property to count the number of items in a list box, the
visual display of the list box becomes distorted if some of the items are
unselected. The counting of the selected items must be done in the
InterActiveChange event for the distortion to occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form in Visual FoxPro and add a list box to it.

2. Select New Property from the Form menu and in the New Property dialog box,
   type Listarray(100) into the Name text box.

3. Add the following code to the Init of the List box:

         FOR I = 1 TO 100
               Thisform.Listarray[i] = "Array"+ALLTRIM(STR(i))
         ENDFOR

4. Add the following code to the InteractiveChange event of the List box.

         xcount = 0
         FOR x = 1 TO This.ListCount
               IF This.Selected(x) = .T.
                    Xcount = xcount + 1
               ENDIF
         ENDFOR

5. Set the list box properties RowSource to 5 - Array and the RowSourceType
   property to Thisform.Listarray. Set the MultiSelect property to .T. - True.

6. Run the form and click on the first item in the list box. Hold the Shift key
   down and press the DownArrow key until all of the items are highlighted in
   the list box.

7. Release the Shift key and scroll back to the top of the list box with the
   mouse or press the PageUp key.

8. Press the Ctrl key and click on three or four of the items in the list box to
   clear them. Note that as more of the list box items become cleared, the more
   distorted the list box becomes.
