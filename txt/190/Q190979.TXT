SUMMARY
=======

The Online Help topic for the CodeLocation property of the Microsoft Visual
Basic Member object describes an optional parameter of Propkind, which is an
enumerated value of vbext_PropertyKind.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CodeLocation property is a read-only property. Assigning a value to the
property will generate the following error:

   Can't assign to read-only property

To work around this problem, use the ProcStartLine method of the CodeModule
Object.
