Parameter Info and Type Info are not generated for the Unicode or ANSI versions
of the Win32 API. These functions can usually be formed by adding "A" or "W"
onto a standard Win32 API function.

Use the generic version of each function. For information on using UNICODE, see
the REFERENCES section.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
