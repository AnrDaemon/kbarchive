-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Edit Undo and Redo options function differently for a text box and an edit
box. A text box operation does not have the Redo option but the Undo option can
be used to perform the same function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Redo Edit option is not available for a text box but is available for an
edit box. A text box operation can be redone by selecting Undo from the Edit
menu.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code:

         frmEditRedo=CREATEOBJECT("form")
         frmEditRedo.CAPTION = "Edit Undo/Redo"
         frmEditRedo.ADDOBJECT("txt","textbox")
         frmEditRedo.ADDOBJECT("ed","editbox")
         frmEditRedo.txt.VISIBLE=1
         frmEditRedo.ed.VISIBLE = 1
         frmEditRedo.ed.LEFT = 150
         frmEditRedo.SHOW(1)

2. Type a letter in the text box and select the Edit menu. Undo is available on
   the Edit menu and selecting Undo will undo the last entry. Select the Edit
   menu item again and the Undo option is available but Redo is not available.

3. Type a letter in the edit box and then select the Edit menu. Undo is
   available, and selecting Undo will undo the last entry. Select the Edit menu
   item again and the Redo option is available.
