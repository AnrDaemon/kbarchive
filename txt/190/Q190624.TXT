TITLE   :PRB: SYS(2018) May Return More Than the Message Parameter
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a table is created programmatically, the Check clause can be used to
perform field level validations. When a field level error occurs, either the
SYS(2018) or the AERRORS function can be used to display the source of the
error. In Visual FoxPro 3.0, the error message parameter that was involved in
the generated error was returned. This behavior is different in Visual FoxPro
5.0 and 6.0. In the latter versions of Visual FoxPro, the entire error message
is returned by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior use the Error cause in the CREATE TABLE, Check
statement, as shown in the MORE INFORMATION section.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code to see the behavior. When the code executes, the
   program continues when an error occurs and the error is displayed using
   SYS(2018) and the AERRORs array. Run the code and first do not select the
   work around and you will see the default error message parameter. If you want
   to see the work around, the CREATE TABLE with the ERROR clause is used.

   Sample Code
   -----------

         *-- Code begins here.
         CLEAR
         ON ERROR *
         IF ADIR(myTestFiles, "sys2018*.dbc") > 0
             nErase=MESSAGEBOX("Erase SYS(2018) Files?",4)
         ENDIF
         IF nErase = 6
             CLOSE DATA
             ERASE sys2018.*
             CREATE DATA sys2018
             OPEN DATA sys2018
             nError = MESSAGEBOX("Workaround?",4)
             IF nError = 6
                 CREATE TABLE sys2018 (NAME c(10) CHECK NAME="Moe" ;
                 ERROR "NAME")
             ELSE
                 CREATE TABLE sys2018 (NAME c(10) CHECK NAME="Moe")
             ENDIF
         ENDIF

         INSERT INTO sys2018 VALUES ("NotMoe")

         &&This causes a validation error.
         ?"SYS(2018) = " + SYS(2018)
         ?
         ?
         =AERROR(aTest)
         DISPLAY MEMO LIKE aTest
         CLOSE DATA ALL
         ON ERROR
      *-- Code ends here.

After the preceding program is finished, the files created can be deleted by
issuing the following command:

      ERASE SYS2018.*
