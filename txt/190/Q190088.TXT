TITLE   :BUG: Icon Resource May Not Appear as Expected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

LoadResPicture functions differently when a Visual Basic project runs in the IDE
or as a compiled EXE. Loading a 16x16 Icon resource within the IDE will return
the proper icon, while in a compiled EXE it will result in an icon that is
"fuzzy."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The instructions given below require that the Resource Editor Add-In is
installed. It is shipped with Visual Basic 6.0 and is available for download by
registered Visual Basic 5.0 owners at the following location:

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

NOTE: This example assumes that the Resource Editor has already been installed
and added to the Tools menu.

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add an Image control (Image1) to Form1.

3. Paste the following code into Form1's code window:

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Set Image1.Picture = LoadResPicture(101, vbResIcon)
         End Sub

4. Select Resource Editor from the Tools menu.

5. Select Add Icon from the Resource Editor's toolbar.

6. In the "Open An Icon File" DialogBox, select a 16x16 icon to add to the
   resource file. The icon just added will have resource ID 101.

7. Save the resource file as "Test.RES" and close the Resource Editor.

8. Select Make Project1.exe from the File menu to compile the project.

9. Press the F5 key to run the project within the IDE. Form1 will appear with
   the proper looking icon.

10. Run the compiled Project1.exe. Form1 will appear with the icon looking
   different than the original.
