TITLE   :XADM: Distribution List Name Changes When Moved to PAB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a distribution list to a Personal Address Book (PAB), the name
changes.

CAUSE
=====

The First Name field is an optional attribute for a Distribution List object. It
is not exposed for entry through the Exchange Server Administrator program.
However, during an import of a .csv file, if the First Name field is specified
for a distribution list, the field will be set. When the distribution list is
copied from the Global Address List to the Personal Address Book, the First Name
is displayed instead of the Display Name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To remove the First Name attribute, export the distribution list to a .csv file
that has "first name" as one of the column headers. Edit the .csv file and
replace the first name with "~DEL" and re-import the .csv file. You must then
remove the distribution list from the Personal Address Book and re-add it to
correct the name in the Personal Address Book.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on the "~del" command, see Q152854, "XADM: Using Bulk
Import to Remove Data," in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

Additional query words: ~del, PAB, DL, Display Name, First Name
