Tandy DMP (dot matrix printers) models 106 and lower do not have a printer driver
for Windows 3.0 or 3.1. Tandy suggests using the Generic Text Only (TTY) driver
for models lower than 106. However, this driver will not work with all those
models.

To obtain phone numbers for Tandy, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   marks)
