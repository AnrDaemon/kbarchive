SUMMARY
=======

PerStor Systems Inc. manufactures a RLL hard disk controller (model #PS180-16FN)
that increases the capacity of normal hard drives by up to 100 percent. It does
this by formatting the drive with 31 sectors per track, as opposed to the normal
17 sectors per track.

According to PerStor Systems, when you run Windows 3.0 in the 386 enhanced mode,
the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file may need to be modified to include:

      virtualhdirq=off

Factory settings load the card's BIOS at C800. This can be changed to D800 by
removing the jumper that connects pins 9 and 10 on jumper 1 of the PerStor
controller board. These are the only addresses that you can select.
