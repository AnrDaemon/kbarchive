SUMMARY
=======

When you run Microsoft Windows, Advanced Logic Research (ALR) recommends using
the "EMMEXCLUDE=" parameter in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file when
the memory cache and/or the shadow RAM feature is enabled.

For example:

      [386Enh]
      EMMEXCLUDE=E000-FFFF

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most newer ALR 386 computers feature a 32K or 64K static memory cache or 128/64
dual memory cache. The cache is always set to the E000-FFFF memory range.
Windows should not use this range if this feature is enabled.

The products included here, ALR computers, are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these product's performance or reliability.
