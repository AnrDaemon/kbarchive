SUMMARY
=======

Memory allocations for static and dynamic scenery may be set in the Setup
Configuration menu. Requesting a higher memory allocation allows individual
scenery files to contain more scenery.

To change the memory allocations for a scenery file, do the following:

1. From the Mode menu, select J, Scenery Design.

2. From the Scenery Designer menu, choose 0, Setup Configuration.

3. Select A for Static Scenery Memory Allocation or B for Dynamic Scenery Memory
   Allocation, and enter the number desired. Note that 61440 (60K) is the
   maximum value.

4. Press ENTER, S to save the configuration.

5. Exit Flight Simulator and restart it to have the changes take effect.

Requesting more memory for scenery requires additional free RAM. If you have
accidentally requested too much memory, you may return to the default values by
deleting the file CONFIG.AD1.
