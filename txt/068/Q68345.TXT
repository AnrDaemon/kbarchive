SUMMARY
=======

If you try to delete a file marked read-only from File Manager, the following
warning message will be display:

   Delete write-protected or hidden file...

File Manager does allow you to delete the file if you choose to do so. There is
no way to prevent a read-only file from being deleted within the File Manager.

MS-DOS, however, displays an access denied message and does not allow you to
delete the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A possible option to prevent a read-only file from being deleted from File
Manager is to set its file attributes to Hidden, and do not include it as a
viewed document. Use the following steps to change a file's attributes to Hidden
from File Manager:

1. From File Manager, select the file you want to hide.

2. From the File menu, select Change Attributes.

3. Put a check mark in the Read-Only box and in the Hidden box and select OK.

4. From the View menu, choose Include.

5. Clear the Show Hidden/System Files box and choose OK.

File Manager stills allow you to delete a read-only file; however, by marking a
file as Hidden, it is less likely to be deleted.
