The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can perform a complete reboot (cold boot) on an 8086-based machine by
jumping to the address FFFF:0000. This action also reboots many 80286 and 80386
machines. The address contains a jump instruction that leads to the machine's
initialization code. For this method to succeed, your machine must be in
real-mode operation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent a memory check on IBM and many compatibles (warm boot), you should
store the value 0 x 1234 in the memory location at 0040:0072. On 100-percent IBM
BIOS compatible machines, an alternative method is to call int 19h instead of
jumping to the address mentioned above.

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: none

   .MODEL small

   .CODE

   Start:
       mov ax, @data                 ; Load ds with data segment
       mov ds, ax

       mov ax, 40h                   ; These three lines cause a memory
       mov es, ax                    ; test NOT to be performed. To
       mov WORD PTR es:[72h], 1234h  ; do a memory test, remove them.

       jmp DWORD PTR b_vec           ; Jump to the reboot address

   .DATA
   b_vec   DW 00000h                 ; Offset of reboot vector
           DW 0FFFFh                 ; Segment of reboot vector

   .STACK

   END Start
