TITLE   :Decreasing Time to Log Onto Network with DOS/OS2 LM
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Here is how to reduce the time it takes to log onto a network:

With an MS-DOS LAN Manager Workstation
--------------------------------------

 - Have a domain controller running NETLOGON to validate the logon. This avoids
   the (default) 45-second timeout.

With an OS/2 LAN Manager Workstation
------------------------------------

There are two options:

 - Have a domain controller running NETLOGON to validate the logon. This avoids
   the (default) 15-second timeout.

 - Change the wrkheuristics 33 bit in the LANMAN.INI file as described in
   Appendix B of the Microsoft Operating System/2 LAN Manager "Administrator's
   Reference." This causes the OS/2 workstation to log onto the network
   STANDALONE after the timeout value specified has been exceeded (if you
   haven't used option 1).
