The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, under low memory conditions, a message may become unbolded
and a return receipt sent even if the message was not successfully read. This
occurs when a user selects a large message to read and the message is read in
from the server, but there is not enough memory to display the message on the
Macintosh screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This low memory condition most often occurs when the Mail desk accessory (DA)
has been opened in another program's application heap by holding down the OPTION
key and choosing Microsoft Mail from the Apple menu. When the message is
selected to be read, the status bar indicates that the message was read from the
server, even though the message is not displayed because of lack of memory. Even
though the message is not read, the message becomes unbolded in the summary
screen and a return receipt is sent to the sender.
