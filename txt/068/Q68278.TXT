KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a COMPAQ SLT286 with Microsoft Windows, the screen may go blank
after you press ALT+TAB to switch between applications.

CAUSE
=====

This symptom is directly related to the COMPAQ PowerCon utility.

The PowerCon utility is used by the SLT286 to conserve battery life by shutting
down the display and hard disk after a specified period of inactivity. The
ALT+TAB combinations prematurely trigger the PowerCon utility.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can set Windows to ignore the ALT+TAB key combination as follows:

1. Start PIF Editor.

2. Click the Advanced button.

3. Under the Reserve Shortcut Keys, check ALT+TAB.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PowerCon function can be disabled by running the COMPAQ setup utility
provided with the system. This alleviates the problem discussed above, but
eliminates the power conservation features offered by PowerCon.

The COMPAQ product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
