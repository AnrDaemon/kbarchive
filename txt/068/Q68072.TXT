SUMMARY
=======

The .MODEL directive can be followed by a language parameter that determines
naming, calling, and returning conventions that are used by the specified
language. The example below demonstrates the syntax.

Although the language type determines the naming convention, it does not
determine the case of any names used. For example if the statement ".MODEL
SMALL, C" is used, case sensitivity of names is not preserved, even though C
preserves case by default. However, an underscore is added in front of any
names. Similarly, if the statement ".MODEL SMALL, PASCAL" is used in a program,
all names are not forced to uppercase (the default for Pascal).

To ensure proper case sensitivity, use the command line option /MX (preserves
case in public and external names), /MU (converts names to uppercase), or /ML
(preserves case in names).

Sample Code
-----------

      .model small,c ; <--- Language specifier
      .code

      myproc proc
             ret
      end
