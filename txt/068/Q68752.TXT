SUMMARY
=======

The NEC Prospeed 386 Laptop may stop responding (hang) during Microsoft Windows
setup if a math coprocessor is installed and the jumper to the left of the math
coprocessor is set incorrectly.

The jumper has three pins. The default settings are pins 2 and 3. Windows
requires that the jumper be set to pins 1 and 2. This has been confirmed by NEC
technical support.

NEC Prospeed users should contact NEC technical support or their dealer for
correct installation instructions.

MORE INFORMATION

CONFIG.SYS files are ignored and files named AUTOEXEC.DS and CONFIG.DS are used.
You also need to add /M:7 to the HIMEM.SYS line:
