SUMMARY
=======

Printing from Windows Paintbrush may produce a miniature version of the actual
image size, approximately 1.5 x 1.5 inch, if the Use Printer Resolution option
is checked.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Use Printer Resolution is selected, Paintbrush translates one screen pixel to
one printer pixel. The Image Attributes dialog box, under Options, is ignored.
Standard VGA resolution is 640 x 480 pixels and most laser printers have a
resolution of 300 dot per inch (dpi). Therefore, a VGA screen image translates
to about 1.5 x 1.5 inch when printed.

To disable this option, follow these steps:

1. Start Paintbrush.

2. Press ALT+F to choose the File menu.

3. Press P for Print.

4. Remove the check from the Use Printer Resolution check box.
