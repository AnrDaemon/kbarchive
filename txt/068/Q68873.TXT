TITLE   :FIX: Warning A4057 When Using Local Variables
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the code below assembled with Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 5.1,
it produces the following error:

   Warning A4057: illegal size for operand

This warning is falsely generated and does not occur with MASM version 5.1a.

The variable arg1, shown in the code below, is a local variable that is defined
as a double word. The warning occurs when arg1 is used as a WORD PTR. This is
acceptable and should not be flagged.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 5.1. This problem
was corrected in version 5.1a.
