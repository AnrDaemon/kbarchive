The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft C/C++ compiler, the /u compiler option turns off the definition
of all predefined identifiers. Therefore, other compiler options that implicitly
define identifiers are incompatible with /u. Nevertheless, no warnings or errors
are generated if an option incompatible with /u is specified.

For example, the /J option changes the default char type from signed char to
unsigned char and implicitly defines the macro _CHAR_UNSIGNED. If both /u and /J
are specified on the same command line, the default char type for that
translation unit will be unsigned char but _CHAR_UNSIGNED will not be defined.
Moreover, the compiler issues no warning, not even at warning level 4, that /u
will undefine those macros defined by /J.

CAUSE
=====

This is expected behavior. The /U (undefine) option turns off the definition of
an single identifier already defined for the preprocessor. The /u option turns
off every defined identifier. Both the /U and /u options apply to predefined
names and user defined ones.
