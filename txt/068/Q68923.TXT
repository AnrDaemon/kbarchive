SUMMARY
=======

Flight Simulator aircraft are designed according to actual aircraft
specifications. The aircraft have been developed by pilots and are further
tested by other pilots prior to release.

Because Flight Simulator is a simulation, there will be flight characteristics
that are not perfectly realistic. Microsoft encourages feedback from pilots and
uses such feedback to improve flight characteristics in future versions.
