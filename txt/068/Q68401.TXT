The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Update program on Server Installation Disk 1 replaces the DEFAULT.SCR script
file during the update process. If you make any modifications to this file
before you complete the update process, the changes will be lost.

NOTE: If you rename your script files to DEFAULT.SCR to get around using the -t
External command-line parameter, you need to be aware that when you update an
existing postoffice and select Update Modem and Script Files under Server
Programs, the DEFAULT.SCR file is overwritten.

The only workaround is to make a backup of the customized files before the update
program is run.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DEFAULT.SCR script file is automatically loaded by the External Mail program
when a modem is used. This file controls modem operations and it can be
customized. For more information about script files, see Appendix N of the
Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide."

The Update program replaces all existing script files, executable files, and any
other file that interacts with the database. These files are updated to ensure
that all programs are in sync with the database.

Additional query words: 2.10e 3.00 3.00b 3.20 3.20a
