======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Quantum's Plus Hardcard XL and Windows, you receive the following
Windows error message:

   Not ready error reading drive x: Abort, Retry, Fail?

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you are using the earlier ATDOSXL.SYS device driver,
version 1.50.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add the /W switch to the device driver in the
CONFIG.SYS file. The new line should read as follows:

   DEVICE=ATDOSXL.SYS /W

MORE INFORMATION
================

Quantum has released a Windows-compatible device driver (version 1.70) for the
Plus Hardcard XL that does not require the /W switch. The new driver can be
obtained from Quantum's bulletin board service (BBS) by calling (408) 894-3214.

To download this driver, do the following:

1. Log on to Quantum's bulletin board using a communications program, such as
   Terminal.

2. Select Download from the menu. At the prompt, enter the filename
   (ATDOSXL.EXE). This file automatically decompresses.

3. Quit the communications session and quit Windows.

4. At the MS-DOS prompt, execute the file (ATDOSXL.EXE); this creates the
   ATDOSXL.SYS file.
