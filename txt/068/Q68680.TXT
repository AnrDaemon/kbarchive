SUMMARY
=======

Some SubLOGIC scenery disks do not load automatically after using the CONVERTS
program supplied with Flight Simulator. It may be necessary to use the CONVERTS
program provided by SubLOGIC in order to automatically load certain scenery.

Newer scenery disks, such as SD-9, SDHawaii, and SD-12 include the SubLOGIC
version of CONVERTS that allows the scenery to load automatically. The CONVERTS
program is available from SubLOGIC Corporation at (217) 359-8482.
