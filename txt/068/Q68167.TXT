SUMMARY
=======

You may experience problems running Microsoft Windows version 3.0 when
conventional memory or environment space is low. One way to save memory is to
avoid the use of TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) programs. If this is not
possible, you can still save memory by invoking TSRs from the CONFIG.SYS file
(when possible) or at the BEGINNING of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each program loaded into memory gets a copy of the environment (the PATH,
PROMPT, and other variables that you set). The more programs loaded in this
manner, the more conventional memory used. If TSRs are loaded before setting any
environmental variables, the memory used by the TSR is reduced by the amount of
space usually taken by the environment string. This memory is rounded to the
nearest 16 bytes.

NOTE: If the PATH is set after TSRs are loaded, full path names must be used.
