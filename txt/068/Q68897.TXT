======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

When creating static scenery, you can specify an elevation (altitude) for a
runway. You cannot specify an altitude for other scenery such as roads, rivers,
polygons, etc.

Setting the altitude for a runway causes all scenery for a one mile radius around
the runway to appear at the new altitude. The altitude of the runway will be
accurately reflected by altimeter readings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set the altitude of a runway, do the following:

1. From the Mode menu, select J, Scenery Design.

2. From the Scenery Designer menu, select 1, Static Scenery Designer.

3. Choose G, Add Runways.

4. Select Runway Altitude.
