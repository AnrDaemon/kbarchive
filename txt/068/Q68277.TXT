SUMMARY
=======

Installation of Aircraft & Scenery Designer (ASD) requires that all Flight
Simulator (FS) version 4.00 files reside on one disk or in one subdirectory.

The Install program copies 26 additional files to the Flight Simulator directory.
Some files are renamed and/or replace existing FS 4.00 files. Listed below are
the ASD files that are copied to the FS directory by the Install program.
