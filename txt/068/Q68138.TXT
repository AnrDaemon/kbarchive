SUMMARY
=======

There are two situations in Microsoft Windows Calculator that require the use of
the Clear Entry (CE) or Clear All (C) buttons:

 - Dividing by zero.

 - Calculating a number that is beyond the range of the current number system.

Under these two situations, selecting other keys or menu items results in a
warning beep if the warning beep is enabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Calculator displays two error messages that indicate this situation:

   Cannot divide by zero

and

   Result is too large for display

   -or-

   Result is too large for (in Windows 3.0 standard view only)

The above error message has been changed in Microsoft Windows 3.1 Calculator to
read:

   Result is too large to store.
