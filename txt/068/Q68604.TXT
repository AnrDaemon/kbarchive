The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, a recipient's name will appear italicized in the Address Mail
window if the recipient is located on a server that has not been seen by the
user's server for half of the "give-up" time. The give-up time is the value (X)
in the Server Settings window for "Remove users of servers not seen for X
days."

When the Mail server changes the recipient names to italics, it sends a
notification message to the Network Manager to inform the Network Manager that
the server on which the italicized recipients are located has not been seen for
half of the give-up time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default give-up time in Mail version 3.00 is 7 days. If the default give-up
time is used, recipients will appear in italics if they are on a server that has
not been seen for 3.5 days. This allows the server enough time to be shut off
for the weekend without causing messages to be sent to Network Managers. The
minimum give-up time is 1 day.
