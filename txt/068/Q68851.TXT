SUMMARY
=======

The Harvard Graphics CAPTURE command doesn't work with Windows 3.0 or 3.1, but
there is a workaround to create a .PCX file that Harvard Graphics can use.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Create the .PCX file as follows:

1. Within Harvard Graphics, open the document you want to capture and press the
   PRINT SCREEN button to copy that screen to the Clipboard as a bitmap.

2. Start Windows Paintbrush. From the Edit menu, choose Paste (or press
   SHIFT+INS) to paste the screen from the Clipboard into Paintbrush.

3. After performing any modifications, save the file by selecting Save As from
   the File menu.

4. Click the Options button to change the file format to .PCX (instead of the
   .BMP default).

If necessary, choose Image Attributes from the Options menu to make sure that the
image attributes are correct for the type of display on which you'll be
displaying the .PCX file. To correctly display a .PCX file in a screenshow, the
.PCX file image attributes should be:

   640 x 350 pixels, 16 colors, and 4 planes
