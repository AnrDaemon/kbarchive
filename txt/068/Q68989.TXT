TITLE   :FIX: HELPMAKE Decodes Help Database Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.03,1.05,1.06,1.07
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft HELPMAKE Utility for MS-DOS and OS/2, versions 1.03, 1.05, 1.06, 1.07 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a concatenated help database is decoded with either "Decode" (/D) or "Decode
Unformatted" (/DU), HELPMAKE may be caught in an infinite loop that will
eventually fill the hard disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

When using HELPMAKE.EXE to decode concatenated help databases, you must use the
"Decode Split" option (/DS).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with HELPMAKE for MS-DOS and OS/2.
This problem was corrected in HELPMAKE version 1.08.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If OS2.HLP is decoded with

   helpmake /D /Ooutfile OS2.HLP

HELPMAKE will decompress the first database in OS2.HLP over and over until either
the disk fills up or you stop the program (with a CTRL+BREAK, for example).

If OS2.HLP is decoded with

   helpmake /DS OS2.HLP

it is broken into STRUCT.HLP, MACROS.HLP, and TABLES.HLP. These help files can
then be decoded properly with the /D or /DU option.

If you don't know how a help file is assembled, the following are the steps to
take to decompress it:

1. Save a backup copy of the help file in case of problems.

2. Rename the help file to "TEMP.HLP".

3. Split the file as follows:

   HELPMAKE /DS TEMP.HLP

   If the file is not a concatenated database, you will get a single file with
   the name of the help database as it was originally built (the internal
   database name).

   If the file is a concatenated database, you will get individual help files
   with the internal database names. For OS2.HLP, these are STRUCT.HLP,
   MACROS.HLP, and TABLES.HLP.

4. Decode the resulting files as follows:

   HELPMAKE /D TEMP1.HLP /OTEMP1.SRC
   HELPMAKE /D TEMP2.HLP /OTEMP2.SRC
