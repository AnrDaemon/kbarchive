 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

HyperCard version 2.0 contains new features that are incompatible with the
Microsoft Mail HyperCard Software Development Kit (SDK) version 2.0. The
HyperCard SDK for Mail version 2.00 is fully compatible with HyperCard versions
1.2.x.

The following compatibility problems may be encountered between the Mail
HyperCard SDK and HyperCard version 2.0:

1. Either of the following commands: msmail(DisplayMessageCenter) or
   msmail(DisplayAddressScreen) will cause a System error to occur.

   To work around this problem, use the msmail(GetUserList) command to access the
   user list and then use the Ask command to select the user. This in effect
   simulates the Address Mail window.

2. When the Mail HyperCard SDK is used with beta versions of HyperCard version
   2.0, the Msmail() command works only the first time it is called. All
   subsequent calls are ignored.

   To correct this problem, use a retail version of HyperCard.
