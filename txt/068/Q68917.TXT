SUMMARY
=======

Aircraft & Scenery Designer offers an enhanced aircraft designer. Although
all aircraft can be modified, only the experimental aircraft can be fully
modified. Aircraft that cannot be fully modified display the message "PARTIAL
DESIGN ONLY" at the top of the designer menu.

Features not available for a particular plane will generally not be shown. For
example, option B, Color and Visual Design, is only available for the Cessna,
Cessna Seaplane, and the experimental aircraft. It is not possible to change the
color of the other planes (for example, the 747-400).
