The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS 
 - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Microsoft C/C++ compiler, if your program prints out your filename
after you type in the following:

   cl filename.c

and then returns to the command prompt without creating an executable file, there
may be duplicate compiler filenames. Within the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) or
Visual Workbench (VWB), it will indicate that there are no warnings or errors
after rebuilding, but the compiler will not create an executable file.

CAUSE
=====

The C compiler is a three-pass compiler, and invokes the files C1.EXE, C2.EXE,
and C3.EXE for C versions 5.1, 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0ax. To determine what files are
being invoked for C/C++ 7.0 and Visual C++ 1.0, add the /d compiler switch to
the command line; for Visual C++ 2.xx and above, add the /Bd switch. Different
files will be used depending on whether it is a C or C++ source file.

If there are any other files with these names on the path before the compiler,
then the compiler may incorrectly execute the wrong file.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a compiler switch, /d or /Bd, that will enable you to print out which
files are being invoked during each pass of the compiler. Use this to determine
if the wrong files are being called by the compiler.

   cl /d filename.c

   -or-

   cl /Bd filename.c
