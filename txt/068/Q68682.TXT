TITLE   :Flt Sim: ENTER (Right Rudder) Not Working on Tandy 1000SL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

The ENTER key on the numeric keypad, which rotates the rudder to the right, will
not function if you choose the Tandy 1000 keyboard option in the start-up menus
while using a Tandy 1000SL computer.

To correct the problem, run Flight Simulator and choose option B, "Function Keys
on Top," in the start-up menus.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Tandy 1000SL computer is a newer variation of the original Tandy 1000. While
the original Tandy 1000 had a nonstandard keyboard that requires the special
selection in the menu, the 1000SL uses a standard extended-type PC keyboard.
"Function Keys on Top" is the correct choice for this keyboard.
