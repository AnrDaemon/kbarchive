======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Aircraft & Scenery Designer (ASD) allows you to enter latitude and longitude
coordinates in the Design Preferences option of the Static Scenery Designer. To
convert to an equivalent Flight Simulator (FS) coordinate, use the following
steps:

1. Press 1, J, 1, L for Design Preferences.

2. Press 0 to cycle through the location systems.

3. Enter the desired latitude and longitude using options A-F.

4. Press ESC to exit, then press L to reenter Design Preferences.

5. Press 0 (zero) until FS Coordinate System is selected.

Similar steps may be used to convert Flight Simulator coordinates to an
approximate latitude and longitude.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ASD location systems for latitude and longitude are an approximate
conversion based on the flat Flight Simulator world. When latitude or longitude
coordinates are entered, they are converted to an FS coordinate that is used
internally by the software. When an FS coordinate is entered, its values remain
precise.
