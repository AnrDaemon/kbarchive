TITLE   :FIX: NMAKE Filename-Parts Syntax Does Not Expand Macros
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, versions 1.01, 1.1, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for OS/2, versions 1.01, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to use macro substitution with the filename-parts syntax or the
extmake option switch fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, replace the extmake switch with the appropriate
predefined macros (such as $** and $?).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with NMAKE. It was corrected in
NMAKE version 1.2 for MS-DOS and OS/2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To demonstrate this error, specify a directory in the SUBDIR variable. Set the
current directory to a different directory and run NMAKE. The file produces the
following command line:

   cl $(SUBDIR)\myfile.c

Sample Makefile
---------------

   SUBDIR = subdir

   myfile.exe: $(SUBDIR)\myfile.c
   cl %|pfeF
