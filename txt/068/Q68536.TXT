The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.0 recognizes six different font family names. These
font family names are:

 - Dontcare

 - Decorative

 - Modern

 - Roman

 - Script

 - Swiss

When you select a font in Windows, Windows attempts to use a screen font of the
same family for display and printing. The printer font name and the screen font
name may be different, although the printed output does appear the same as the
font on the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is because both fonts belong to the same font family. The following is a
list of fonts that belong to the same font family:

Font Family     Bitstream    Canon    Adobe        HP
-----------     ---------    -----    -----        --

Swiss (Helv)    Swiss        Swiss    Helvetica    Universe
Roman (Tms Rmn) Dutch        Dutch    Times Roman  CG Times

An example where this might cause some confusion is if you type the font name
Helvetica in a Windows applications printing to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
III and the printed output resembles Helvetica even though Helvetica is not a
font supported on this printer. This behavior occurs because the driver
interprets the request for Helvetica and selects Universe on the printer.

There are similar fonts with different names because these font names are
copyrighted. Windows uses the Helv font name for Swiss family screen fonts and
the Tms Rmn font name for Roman family screen fonts.
