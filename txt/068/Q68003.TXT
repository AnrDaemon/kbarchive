SUMMARY
=======

Edlin appears to treat lines containing 69 characters as though they visually
wrap on the screen. To see this behavior, use Edlin's "L" command.

Normally, without line wrapping, Edlin's "L" command displays one full screen of
text. If a line containing 69 characters is contained within the lines being
displayed, the following prompt is displayed:

   Continue (Y/N)?

The number of lines displayed on the screen at this point is fewer than one full
screen, even though screen wrapping has not occurred.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 4.0, 4.01, and
5.0. Edlin is not included with later versions of MS-DOS.

Additional query words: 4.00 4.01 5.00 noupd
