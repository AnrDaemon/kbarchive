SUMMARY
=======

Zenith has released a modified version of Microsoft Windows version 3.0 to run
on its laptop computers. This version of Windows contains the following
modifications:

 - Zenith logo screen (instead of the Microsoft logo)

 - Additional video drivers to support the LCD display found on some of its
   laptops

 - Its own SWAPFILE utility

MORE INFORMATION
================

Only the Zenith laptops (such as the TurbosPort 386, SupersPort 386e, and
MinisPort) require the Zenith version of Windows 3.0.

When you install Zenith's version of Windows on the TurbosPort 386, it may stop
responding (hang) when you insert Disk 2 if you have selected the incorrect
display. The TurbosPort 386 has a CGA display rather than an LCD display.

The Zenith products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
