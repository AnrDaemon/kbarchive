SUMMARY
=======

If you cannot print from a DOS application in the enhanced mode of Microsoft
Windows version 3.0, you may have a device contention problem. You can resolve
this problem by doing the following:

1. From the Main group of Program Manager, choose the Control Panel icon.

2. From Control Panel, choose the 386 enhanced icon.

3. In the Idle section of the Device Contention box, set the seconds down to 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are running more than one application in enhanced mode of Windows and one
of the applications is a DOS application, both applications may need to use the
same printer or communications device. The Idle section of the 386 enhanced icon
in Control Panel controls how many seconds should pass before another
application can use the device.
