device (including a 386 enhanced-mode virtual device). The documentation for the
Microsoft Windows DDK includes several references to the SDK documentation. The
SDK documentation contains detailed information on the new features supported by
Windows.

For technical assistance while developing a driver or virtual device, contact

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following languages, tools, and software are necessary to produce a device
driver or a virtual device for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or 3.1:

1. Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 5.1 or higher (for all drivers).

2. Microsoft C Compiler version 6.0 or higher (generally used for printer
   drivers).

3. Version 3.0 of the DDK supports the Microsoft C Compiler version 5.1 for
   those developers who have not upgraded to a later version of the compiler or
   who desire to confirm successful DDK installation by building a driver and
   performing a binary comparison with the corresponding driver included in the
   DDK. Version 5.1 of the Microsoft C Compiler is no longer commercially
   available.

4. The tools and files included with the Microsoft Windows DDK and the Microsoft
   Software SDK.

5. The Windows retail product and various applications (for debugging and
   testing). Version 3.1 of the Windows DDK includes display, printer and
   network compatibility tests to assist in debugging a driver.
