SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to set up or configure a printer driver from the Microsoft
Windows Supplemental Driver Library (SDL), the following error message may
appear

   Insufficient memory to run Setup for <printer> driver

where <printer> is the name of the printer driver file.

This error can be caused by one of the following conditions:

 - There is not enough memory to run the printer setup.

-or-

 - The generic driver support files, GENDRV.EXE and GENLIB.DLL, are missing,
   corrupted, or did not get copied into the Windows \SYSTEM subdirectory during
   printer installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there is not enough memory to run Printer Setup, try to increase available
memory by closing all other open applications.

There are several SDL printer drivers (listed below) that are actually "printer
definition files" and not complete drivers. They require the following two
generic driver support files to be present in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

Filename     Size     Date       Location
----------   ------   ------     ---------
 
GENDRV.EXE  71808    9-20-90     (5.25-inch disk 2)
GENDRV.EXE  71808    9-20-90     (3.5-inch disk 7)
 
GENLIB.DLL  65792    9-20-90     (5.25-inch disk 4)
GENLIB.DLL  65792    9-20-90     (3.5-inch disk 4)

These files is normally copied as part of the setup for the printer driver from
the SDL disk. Some printers require some additional support files to function
correctly. These additional files are also included on the SDL.

The following printer drivers are supplied on the SDL and require the generic
driver support files GENDRV.EXE and GENLIB.DLL:

If the GENDRV.EXE and GENLIB.DLL generic driver support files did not get copied
into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, you may copy these files from the SDL
disks manually. If they are missing or corrupt, you should contact Microsoft
Product Support at (425) 454-2030.
