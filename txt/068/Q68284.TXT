SYMPTOMS
========

Your mouse pointer may appear slightly distorted when you use an 8515 monitor
and 8514/A adapter with Microsoft Windows version 3.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

Installing a mouse driver in your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file can sometimes
resolve this problem.

Windows uses the MOUSE.DRV (or similar .DRV) file to provide a mouse to Windows
and Windows applications. Installing a mouse driver at the MS-DOS level can
sometimes provide a more stable configuration.
