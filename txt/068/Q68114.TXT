SUMMARY
=======

In versions of Microsoft Windows earlier than version 3.0, the system font is
fixed pitch; beginning with Windows version 3.0, the system font is
proportional. This change can causes difficulties when applications developed
for earlier versions of Windows are moved to version 3.0. Below is an
explanation of how to use a fixed-pitched font as the system default. Because
this technique affects all applications in the system, however, it should be
used with caution.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the default system font to any value, modify the fonts.fon= entry in
the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.ini file. The module name of any font listed
here, specified in the module definition (DEF) file for the font dynamic-link
Library (DLL) must be FONTS. If the font DLL has a different module name,
Windows does not boot, and the debugging version of Windows displays a FatalExit
(RIP) code of 0x0401 on the debugging monitor or terminal.

Therefore, to take advantage of this technique, create a custom font with the
proper module name. Install the font and modify the SYSTEM.ini file so that
Windows uses that font as the system default.
