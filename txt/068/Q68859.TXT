The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

PageMaker version 3.01 uses an Internal PageMaker Format for its line art
produced by the line tools from the tool box. PageMaker line art can be copied
to the Windows Clipboard but cannot be viewed or pasted into other Windows'
applications that do not support the Internal PageMaker Format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PageMaker version 3.01 can use the Windows Clipboard to cut, copy, and paste its
own line art. The Windows Clipboard will not display the graphics image as it
appears in PageMaker, but instead will display the following message:

   (Cannot display data in this format)

If you select Display from the Clipboard menu bar, it will indicate Internal
PageMaker Format. If a Windows application supports the Internal PageMaker
Format, then the Paste command from the Edit menu will be available; otherwise
the Paste command will be grayed.
