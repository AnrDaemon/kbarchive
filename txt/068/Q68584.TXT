SUMMARY
=======

An application should not attempt to create a window subclass for standard
Windows controls such as combo boxes and buttons.

SetClassLong() should not be used to subclass an entire standard control class.
This would cause all controls of that type (including controls in other
applications) created while the subclass was in effect to be subclassed.

SetWindowLong() can be used to subclass individual controls in your application.

In addition, standard Windows controls should only be subclassed in "non-
intrusive" ways. Subclassing procedures that alter the appearance of a control
or that depend on undocumented messages or message parameters could be
incompatible with future versions of Windows.

For more information on subclassing a control, please see the "Safe Subclassing"
article on the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) CD.

Charles Petzold's "Programming Windows" (Microsoft Press) contains a sample
program that shows how to subclass a standard control (in this case, a scroll
bar). In the Windows 2.x version of the book, the sample is called COLORSCR; in
the Windows 3.0 version, the sample is called COLORS1.
