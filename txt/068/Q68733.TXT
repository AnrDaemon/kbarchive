SUMMARY
=======

Paradise instructs you to copy a SETUP.INF file from the Paradise driver's disk
to the WINDOWS directory, and then install the appropriate Paradise video
driver. These instructions are correct. However, once the Paradise video driver
is installed, the SETUP.INF in the Windows directory (copied from the Paradise
disk) MUST be deleted. The original Windows SETUP.INF file should still reside
in the SYSTEM subdirectory under the WINDOWS directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is caused by the Paradise SETUP.INF file, which only contains
information concerning the Paradise drivers. Windows Setup uses SETUP.INF when
configuring Windows for use with different hardware devices. By deleting
Paradise's SETUP.INF file from the WINDOWS directory, Windows Setup is able to
locate the Windows SETUP.INF file located in the SYSTEM subdirectory.
