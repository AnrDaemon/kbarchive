SUMMARY
=======

Ventura Gold does not print the last page of a print job on a PostScript printer
connected to a COMx: port if the Flow Control (handshaking) has not been set to
Hardware From Ports in the Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows requires the Flow Control (handshaking) be set to the Hardware option
for printers connected to a serial communications port.

Ventura prints the publication correctly if File is selected as the port and the
output is redirected to a File.

-------------------------------------------------------

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Ports icon.

2. Select the port used by the printer.

3. Choose the Settings button.

4. Select Hardware for the Flow Control.

5. Choose the OK button, then choose the Close button and exit Control Panel to
   save your changes.
