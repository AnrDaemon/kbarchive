SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program, you may
receive the following error message:

   Window Title: Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   Access denied.
   Microsoft Windows NT ID no: 0xc0020005

However, you can start the Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program from other
computers on the network.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the account that you are using to run the Exchange
Server 5.5 Administrator program does not have at least Read permissions on the
following registry key:

   "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup"

Microsoft recommends that the Everyone group (or the Authenticated Users group)
at least have Read permission on all subkeys of the following key:

   "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange"

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior:

1. At a command prompt, start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate, and then click the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup

3. On the Security menu, click Permission.

4. Grant Read permission to the account that you want to use to start the
   Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program.

To prevent future problems, grant Read access to the Everyone group (or to the
Authenticated Users group).
