TITLE   :PRB: Error -2147467259 When VB Client Calls Method on COM Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Visual Basic 6.0 client calls a method on a Component Object Model (COM)
object, the Visual Basic runtime may report the following error message:

   Run-time error '-2147467259 (80004005)': Method '~' of object '~' failed

Namely, the method call returns E_FAIL, but the object either does not implement
the ISupportErrorInfo interface or does not provide an error object by calling
the CreateErrorInfo function.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use proper error handling code, you can determine the server name that
contains the object that returns the error. This information is stored in the
Source property of the Err object. For example, the following code creates an
event log entry when the error occurs:

   Private Sub TestSub()
       On Error GoTo errHandler
       Dim o As TestServer.Class1
       Set o = New TestServer.Class1
       o.SomeMethod
       Exit Sub
   errHandler:
       App.LogEvent "Error in TestSub: " & Err.Number & "; Source: " & Err.Source & "; Description: " & Err.Description
   End Sub

If the above-mentioned error occurs when o.SomeMethod is called, you can identify
the function name (TestSub), the error number [-2147467259 (80004005)], the
error source (TestServer), and the description (Method '~' of object '~'
failed). You can use this information to narrow the cause of the problem.

If you are debugging in the Visual Basic integrated development environment
(IDE), and if the COM object is running in process, you can obtain a more
specific error description that includes the object and method names. To
determine the root cause of the problem, debug the method of the object that
returns E_FAIL.
