TITLE   :BUG: Reloading the Solution from Visual SourceSafe Changes the S
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Enterprise Architect Edition 
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Enterprise Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual Studio .NET, when you reload the solution that contains multiple
projects from Visual SourceSafe, the startup project may be changed.

CAUSE
=====

This is in the environment code. When the solution is closed, the startup
project is reset to NULL, which makes another project the startup project.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the startup project manually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use Visual Basic .NET to create a Web Service Project named MyWebService.
   (Visual Basic .NET also creates the solution MyWebService.)

2. Create a Web Application Project named MyWebApplication, and then add it to
   the MyWebService solution.

3. Set the project as the startup project, and then set the WebForm1.aspx as the
   start page.

4. Add this solution to Source Control.

   NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you always allow addition of Web projects that
   use File Share to have access to Source Control.

5. To run the web form, press F5.

6. Close both the solution and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

7. Open the solution from Visual Source Control:

On the File menu, click Source Control, and then click "Open From Source
Control". (You must create a new folder named NewMyWebService for the reload
process.)
Note that the startup project is changed to the MyWebService project.
