TITLE   :Setup Does Not Recognize .inf File During Unattended HIS Install
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify an .inf setup file for an unattended install of either the Host
Integration Server (HIS) 2000 clients (HIAdmin.msi/HIClient.msi) or server
(HIServer.msi), the Setup program does not recognize the values in the .inf
setup file. As a result, the HIS clients/HIS server software is installed with
default settings.

CAUSE
=====

You did not specify the path to the .inf file in the command line. For example,
the following command line performs an unattended install, but the specialized
.inf file HIServer.inf will be ignored:

   MSIExec /I hiserver.msi UNATTENDED_INSTALL_FILENAME=hiserver.inf /q

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify the path to the .inf file by changing the command line to appear as
follows:

   MSIExec /I hiserver.msi UNATTENDED_INSTALL_FILENAME=<path>\hiserver.inf
   /q
