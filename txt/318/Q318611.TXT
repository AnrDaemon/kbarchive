SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to associate 3270 display logical units (LUs) with
3270 printer LUs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

From Server Manager
-------------------

1. Add one or more 3270 display LUs and corresponding 3270 printer LUs to a
   connection.

2. Select a display LU.

3. On the View menu, click Properties.

4. On the Associated Printers tab, select a printer LU from the Associated
   Printer LU list box.

5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for each display LU that you want to associate with
   a printer LU.

6. On the Action menu, click Save configuration.

NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you assign the display LUs to a pool and then
configure the pool with the appropriate users or groups. On the Pool properties
page, make sure that you select the option "Pool Contains Display LUs with
Associated Printers".

From the Client Computer That Runs the Third-party Emulator
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Configure a display session as you do normally.

2. Configure a printer session. ASSOCPRT now appears in the drop-down list box
   of available resources.

3. Select ASSOCPRT as the LU, and then connect.

This feature is designed to support specialized host applications that have
hard-coded associations between display LUs and printer LUs. When a 3270 display
LU is configured to have an associated printer, and is later assigned to a user
or group, users can see both the display LU and a special printer LU named
ASSOCPRT. When users connect to the display LU, they can open the ASSOCPRT LU,
which SNA Server maps to the defined associated printer LU.

When you assign multiple display LUs to users, the order in which the resources
are opened is critical. If all of the display LUs have associated printers, the
user should alternate opening displays and ASSOCPRTs. If some of the display LUs
do not have associated printers, use a naming convention to help the user
distinguish the display LUs that have associated printers from the display LUs
that do not have associated printers.
