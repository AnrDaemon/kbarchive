OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase KbDBFDBC kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700 _IK283 kbVFP700sp1fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you call a function in a SELECT statement in which an error occurs, and the
SELECT statement uses an ORDER BY clause, Visual FoxPro does not release the
memory that was used to process the SELECT statement.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

Quit Visual FoxPro for the memory to be released.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0.

This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Paste the following code in a program (.prg) file, and then run the program
   from the Command window:

   ON ERROR *
   CLOSE DATABASES ALL
   DELETE FILE testtab1.DBF
   CREATE TABLE testtab1 (longfield c(254))
   FOR T=1 TO 10000
      SELECT * FROM testtab1 ORDER BY UPPER(longfield)
   ENDFOR
   RETURN

2. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open Task Manager, and then note the amount of
   memory that is available.

3. Run the program again and note the amount of memory that is available. It
   will be approximately 180 MB less than the amount of memory that was
   available before the program was run.
