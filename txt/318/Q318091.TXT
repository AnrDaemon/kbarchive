TITLE   :MS02-018: Patch for Buffer Overrun in HTR ISAPI Extension

PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSecurity kbCOMIS kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix kbWin2000PreSP3Fix kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A buffer overrun vulnerability exists in Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0
and Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0. By sending a specially chosen
request to an affected Web server, an attacker can cause the server to
temporarily stop providing Web services or, in very unusual cases, the attacker
can gain control of the server.

A number of factors, including the following, tend to reduce the severity of this
vulnerability:

 - It is extremely hard to inject code by exploiting this vulnerability because
   the overrun is not on the stack and is only a single byte over the allocated
   buffer.

 - By default, the IIS Lockdown Tool removes the component that contains the
   vulnerability.

 - The default configuration of the URLScan tool prevents the vulnerability from
   being exploited.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because the Internet Server Application Programming
Interface (ISAPI) extension that implements HTR scripting contains an off-by-one
error when it calculates the size of a buffer for storing an input value. If a
request for an HTR script is malformed in a particular way, it is possible to
abuse the miscalculation and conduct a buffer overrun attack. In the least
serious case, this can result in the failure of the IIS service; in the most
serious case (which is very hard to exploit), it can allow code to be run on the
server.
