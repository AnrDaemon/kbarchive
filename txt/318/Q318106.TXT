SUMMARY
=======

When you set up (or map) custom attributes in Exchange Server by using the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, it is extremely important that
you define the attributes and populate the attributes in the correct order. This
article describes the correct method to do so.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reduce the occurrence of duplicate entries, you must first define the custom
attribute mapping in DS Site Configuration before you populate the attribute.

The following procedure is the correct order to follow:

WARNING: If you use the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly, serious problems may occur that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from using raw mode
incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Administrator program.

2. Click Configuration.

3. Double-click DS Site Configuration, and then click the Custom Attributes tab.

4. Type a name for each attribute that you want to use in the Values section.

5. Click OK, and then exit the Administrator program.

6. Start the Administrator program in raw mode by typing the following text at a
   command prompt:

   "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

7. Click an object such as a mailbox.

8. On the File menu, click RAW Properties.

9. In the "List attributes of type" box, click All.

10. For each attribute that you defined as a custom attribute in step 4, verify
   that the Object Attribute definition matches the common name
   <Extension-Attribute-X>, where <X> is the custom attribute
   number that you defined for that attribute in step 4.

11. After you have verified that the Object Attribute definition matches the
   common name <Extension-Attribute-X>, populate the defined custom
   attribute either manually or through a Directory Import.

NOTE: The key to success in this process is to define the custom attribute
mapping first, verify that the custom attribute was mapped properly, and then
enter the data for that defined attribute.
