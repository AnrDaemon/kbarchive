KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700 _IK283

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Visual FoxPro 7.0 on a Double-byte Character Set (DBCS) enabled
system, the XMLToCursor() function truncates data. The resulting field is only
half as long as it should be, and the last half of the data is truncated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

Run the following code from Visual FoxPro 7.0 on a DBCS-enabled system (such as
Chinese Microsoft Windows 2000):

   LOCAL lccCharsDB AS STRING

   CLEAR
   CLOSE DATABASES ALL
   CD JUSTPATH(SYS(16))
   lcCharsDB = CHR(191) + CHR(201) + ;
   	CHR(209) + CHR(211) + ;
   	CHR(201) + CHR(236) + ;
   	CHR(152) + CHR(203) + ;
   	CHR(202) + CHR(190) + ;
   	CHR(213) + CHR(90) + ;
   	CHR(209) + CHR(212)
   CREATE TABLE DBCS (memo1 m)
   INSERT INTO DBCS VALUES (lcCharsDB)
   CURSORTOXML("DBCS", "MyString.xml", 1, 512)
   TYPE MyString.XML
   XMLTOCURSOR("MyString.xml", "MyCursor", 512)
   SELECT mycursor
   BROWSE

   *~ Clean Up
   USE IN MyCursor
   USE IN DBCS
   ERASE MyString.XML
   ERASE DBCS.DBF
   ERASE DBCS.FPT

Notice that when you browse the table, the memo1 field is only half as long as it
should be. The remaining data is truncated.
