SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Service Pack 6 (SP6) introduces a new registry key that restricts
users from being able to view folders on a drive. With Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 5 (SP5), administrators that set up shortcuts to folders under a
locked-down configuration that they wanted their users to be able to open could
not do so. This was fixed in Windows NT 4.0 SP6, but if an administrator would
like the functionality of Windows NT 4.0 SP5, the administrator would need to
add another restriction ("NoViewOnDrive"), and set the value to a dword value of
1.
