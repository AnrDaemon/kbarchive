PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbGrpDSSSafe

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view the extensible markup language (XML) source for a large XML
Schema definition language (XSD) file, and if the solution is under source code
control, you are prompted to check out the XSD file.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Studio .NET must check out the file to save information that must be
written to the XSD file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the file in Visual Studio .NET before you view the source.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
