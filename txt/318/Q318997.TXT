SYMPTOMS
========

space is produced between the detail band and the page footer in the ASCII file
that is created. This assumes that there is space between the detail band and
the page footer on the report.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Paste the following code in a program (.prg) file named Test, and then run
   the program from the Command window:

   CLOSE TABLES ALL
   DELETE FILE mytest.DBF
   DELETE FILE myreport.fr?
   DELETE FILE myreport.txt

   CREATE TABLE mytest (fld1 C(20), fld2 C(20))
   FOR x = 1 TO 5
   	INSERT INTO mytest VALUES (REPLICATE(CHR(64+x),10), ;
                             REPLICATE(CHR(64+x),10))
   ENDFOR

   CREATE REPORT myreport NOWAIT
   *Make a quick report
   KEYBOARD "{ALT+R}Q{PAUSE 1}{ENTER}"
   ACTIVATE WINDOW 'Report Designer'
   KEYBOARD "{CTRL+W}"
   DOEVENTS

   REPORT FORM myreport PREVIEW
   REPORT FORM myreport TO FILE myreport.txt ASCII
   MODIFY FILE myreport.txt NOWAIT
   USE

2. After you run the program, view the Report Preview. Note that the report
   contains five lines of data, followed by white space, and then a date in the
   page footer.

3. Close the Report Preview window, and note that the report now shows the date
   directly below the last line of data in the ASCII text file.
