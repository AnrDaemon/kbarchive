PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbContainer kbCtrl kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700 _IK283 kbVFP700sp1fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute code on a form from the Click, the RightMouse, the MouseUp, and
the MouseDown events in an empty grid, the code in these events is not called.

CAUSE
=====

When the grid is empty, the code in these events is not called. If the grid has
at least one record, the events fire properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows version 7.0. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS

Windows 7.0.

This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack 1.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Paste the following code in a program (.prg) file named Test, and then run
   the program from the Command window:

   PUBLIC ox
   CREATE CURSOR Test (f1 c(5), f2 c(10))
   **INSERT INTO Test VALUES ('xxx','yyy')
   ox = CREATEOBJECT('form')
   ox.ADDOBJECT('grd1','grd')
   ox.grd1.RECORDSOURCE = 'Test'
   ox.grd1.VISIBLE = .T.
   ox.SHOW

   DEFINE CLASS grd AS GRID

   	COLUMNCOUNT = 0

   	ADD OBJECT col1 AS COL

   	ADD OBJECT col2 AS COL

   	PROCEDURE RIGHTCLICK
   	WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() TIMEOUT 1
       ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE CLICK
   	WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() TIMEOUT 1
       ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE MOUSEUP
   	LPARAMETERS nButton, nShift, nXCoord, nYCoord
   	WAIT WINDOW  PROGRAM() TIMEOUT 1
       ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE MOUSEDOWN
   	LPARAMETERS nButton, nShift, nXCoord, nYCoord
   	WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() TIMEOUT 1
       ENDPROC

   ENDDEFINE

   DEFINE CLASS COL AS COLUMN

   	ADD OBJECT hdr1 AS HEADER

   	PROCEDURE hdr1.CLICK
   	WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() TIMEOUT 1
       ENDPROC
   	PROCEDURE hdr1.RIGHTCLICK
   	WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() TIMEOUT 1
       ENDPROC
       PROCEDURE MOUSEUP
   	LPARAMETERS nButton, nShift, nXCoord, nYCoord
   	WAIT WINDOW  PROGRAM() TIMEOUT 1
       ENDPROC

   	PROCEDURE MOUSEDOWN
   	LPARAMETERS nButton, nShift, nXCoord, nYCoord
   	WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() TIMEOUT 1
       ENDPROC

   ENDDEFINE

2. Right-click within the grid. Note that the Click, the RightMouse, the
   MouseUp, and the MouseDown events do not fire when the grid is empty.

3. Right-click on the grid header. Note that the Click, the RightMouse, the
   MouseUp, and the MouseDown events for the column also do not fire when the
   grid is empty.

4. To resolve this problem, open Test.prg, uncomment the following line of code,
   and then repeat steps 2 and 3:

   INSERT INTO Test VALUES ('xxx','yyy')

5. Repeat Steps 2 and 3, and observe that the events fire.
