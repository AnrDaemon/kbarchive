PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCtrl kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport kbCodeSnippet kbvfp700 _IK283 kbVFP700sp1fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the cSchemaName parameter of the CURSORTOXML function to convert a
Visual FoxPro cursor into XML text and build a schema, the reserved word
"IsDataSet" in the schema is misspelled as "lsDataSet". The first letter of the
reserved word is a lower case letter "L" instead of an upper case letter "I".

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0.

This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Paste the following code in a program (.prg) file, and then run the program from
the Command window:

   CREATE CURSOR xml_test ( fld1 C(25))
   INSERT INTO xml_test VALUES("IsDataSet is misspelled.")
   CURSORTOXML("xml_test", "xml_var", 1, 0, 0, "1")
   STRTOFILE(xml_var, "isdataset.xsd")
   MODIFY FILE isdataset.xsd NOWAIT
   KEYBOARD '{CTRL+F10}'

After the text file isdataset.xsd opens, note that the reserved word "IsDataSet"
is misspelled "lsDataSet" in the fifth line of the file.
