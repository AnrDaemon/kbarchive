To resolve this issue, replace the following DLL files with new copies from a
Windows NT 4.0 computer that is updated to the same service pack level and that
is running the same version of Microsoft Internet Explorer as the Windows NT
installation on which you experience this issue:

   Msvcrt.dll
   Msvcirt.dll
   Msvcrt20.dll
   Msvcrt40.dll

To do this, use one of the following methods, as appropriate to your situation.

Method 1: Contact Microsoft to Obtain Copies of the DLL Files

2. Copy the replacement DLL files to the %<SYSTEM_ROOT>%\System32 folder
   of your Windows NT installation.

Method 2: Perform a Parallel Windows Installation

   files in step 4, update the original Windows installation to the latest
   version of Internet Explorer.

4. Start Windows Explorer, and then copy the following files from the
   %<SYSTEM_ROOT>%\System32 folder on the new Windows installation to the
   %<SYSTEM_ROOT>%\System32 folder of the Windows installation with which
   you experience this issue:
