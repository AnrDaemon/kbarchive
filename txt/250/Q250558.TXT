The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may notice that the default "Message text word wrap" setting for
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) attachments are incorrect. You can
observe this behavior when you administer the Internet Mail Service by clicking
the Internet Mail tab, and then by clicking "Advanced options".

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the Internet Mail tab of the Internet Mail Service properties, you can click
Message Content to send attachments by using MIME or uuencode. If you select
MIME to send attachments, in the "Advanced options" dialog box, under "Message
text word wrap", Never is selected by default. The value in the "At column" box
is also set to 76 by default, and is unavailable (dimmed).

To ignore the default word wrapping for MIME attachments, click "At column", and
then reselect Never.

The value in the "At column" box is changed to "0". If this value is set to "0",
the default word wrapping for MIME attachments is ignored.
