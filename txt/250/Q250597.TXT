When you start Windows 2000 Professional is started for the first time, the
Getting Started with Windows 2000 dialog box appears for each user. If you click

Windows 2000 Professional CD-ROM (CD).

 - Insert the Windows 2000 Professional CD in the CD-ROM drive of the local
   computer. When the Windows 2000 CD Not Found dialog box is displayed, click
   OK to run the Discover Windows program.

-or-

 - If you want to start the Discover Windows program from a different location
   on the local hard disk, copy the Discover folder from the Windows 2000
   Prefessional CD to the \%SystemRoot% folder on the local hard disk. When you
   start the Discover Windows program, click OK on the Windows 2000 CD Not Found
   dialog box. To run the Discover 2000 tour from a different location, click
   Cancel, and then click Cancel again.

   The Discover Tour Not Found dialog box is displayed with the message "The
   Discover Tour could not be located. Please indicate the location of the
   required files." Type the location of the files as
   "<drive_letter>\%SystemRoot%" (without the quotation marks) in the text
   box to start the Discover Windows program from the local hard disk.

   You only need to do this once. The next time that you start the Discover
   Windows program, the Windows 2000 CD Not Found dialog box will not be
   displayed.

STATUS

This behavior is by design.
