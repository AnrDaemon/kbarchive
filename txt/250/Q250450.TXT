TITLE   :XFOR: Using Notes Document Type Cause Address Books to Reload
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Lotus Notes document type field (Type) to synchronize
information from Notes to Exchange Server, the target Address Books are reloaded
every cycle although the original Exchange Server entries have not been changed.

CAUSE
=====

When the Type field is specified in the Amap.tbl file and the Mapnotes.tbl file
does not specify the mapping value of Type, directory synchronization between
Notes and Exchange Server (the Dxanotes process) tries to compare the protected
value in Notes against a NULL value, which causes all of the entries in the
target Address Book to reload.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Pack 4.
