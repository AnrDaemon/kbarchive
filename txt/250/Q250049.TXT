TITLE   :Domain Users Denied Access When Running Logon Script from PDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When domain users try to run the logon script in the netlogon share of the
primary domain controller (PDC), they may receive an error message stating that
access is denied. However, they may be able to access the backup domain
controller netlogon shares.

You, as an administrator, are able to run the logon script from all domain
controllers.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the users' permissions to the netlogon share of the
PDC are incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, change the file permissions on the files in the
netlogon share on the PDC to grant read access to the Everyone group.
