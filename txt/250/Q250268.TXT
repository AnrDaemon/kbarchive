-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you check Event Viewer, you may notice that it reports the following event
logged by your Domain Name Server (DNS):

   Event ID 156:
   DNS Server does not have a cache (or database) entry for root name server. The
   cache file MUST have at least one NS record, indicating a root DNS server and
   a corresponding A record for that root DNS server. Otherwise the DNS server
   will be unable to contact the root DNS server on startup and will be unable
   to answer queries for names outside of its own authoritative zones.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Cache.dns file is corrupted or contains invalid
entries.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, follow these steps:

1. Stop the DNS service.

2. Rename the existing Cache.dns file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dns folder to
   Cache.old.

3. Copy the Cache.dns file from the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dns\Backup folder into
   the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dns folder.

4. Restart the DNS service.
