SUMMARY
=======

After the initial installation of SQL Server 6.5 and Service Pack 5, restarting
SQL Server 6.5 Setup from the Start menu brings up the BackOffice compliancy
message, even though the latest version of the service pack is installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The BackOffice compliancy message states that the SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 5
is necessary to run the product on Windows 2000. This message appears when
installing the product for the first time.

In order to run SQL Server 6.5 on Windows 2000, SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 5
must be applied after SQL Server 6.5 installation. If SQL Server is reinstalled,
Service Pack 5 must be reapplied as well.
