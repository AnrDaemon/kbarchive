TITLE   :XFOR: Cannot Open Internet Mail Service Page with SMTP Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete the Extension for Internet Mail Service For i386 from the
Add-Ins container in the Exchange Administrator program, and then attempt to
open the Internet Mail Service properties page, you may receive the following
message:

   Extension SMTP could not be loaded.
   The extension for Microsoft Exchange Administrator's CPU type has not been
   installed in the site.
   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   ID no: c1031667

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Exchange Administrator program cannot load the
Imcadmin.dll file because the extension object is missing or has been deleted
from the Exchange Administrator directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

CAUTION: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Administrator program (admin /r)
incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can
be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

NOTE: If you click Ignore instead of Abort or Retry in the error message box, the
Internet Mail Service properties page opens.

To resolve this behavior, re-create the directory extension object in raw mode of
the Exchange Administrator program. Follow these steps:

1. Run Windows Explorer to confirm that X:\Exchsrvr\Add-Ins contains the
   Imcadmin.dll file. If the file is missing, you can replace it from the
   Setup\I386 or Alpha\Add- ins\Smtp\I386 or Alpha directory on the Microsoft
   Exchange Server CD.

   NOTE: If this file exists on another Exchange Server computer on the same
   site, it is dynamically replicated when the Internet Mail Service property
   page is opened.

2. Log on to Exchange Server with the Exchange Server Service account.

3. At the command prompt, use the cd command to change to the Exchsrvr/Bin
   directory.

4. Use the admin /r command, and then press ENTER. This opens the Exchange
   Administrator program in raw mode.

5. On the site level, expand the Configuration container, and then click the
   Add-Ins container.

6. From the File menu, click New Other, and then click Raw Object.

7. In the New Raw Object dialog box, click Admin-Extension, and then click OK.

8. In the Properties page, click Directory Name, and under Edit Value, type
   "SMTP:i386" (without the quotation marks) and then click Set.

9. Click File-Version, and under Edit Value, type the hexadecimal value for the
   version and then click Set.

   NOTE: You can find the hexadecimal number by looking at the same directory
   object on another Exchange Server 5.5 computer that is running the same
   service pack. This value can be found in the site level, expand the
   Configuration container, and then click the Add-Ins container. Select the Raw
   Properties of "Extensions for Internet Mail Service for I386". Then choose
   the File-Version object.

10. Click Admin-Extension-Dll, and under Edit Value, type "Imcadmin.dll"
   (without the quotation marks), and then click Set.

11. Click OK.

12. Expand the Add-Ins container, open the SMTP:i386 Properties page, and in the
   Display Name box, type "Extension for Internet Mail Service for i386"
   (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

13. Expand the Connections container, and then attempt to open the Internet Mail
   Service Properties page. If you cannot access the Internet Mail Service
   Properties page, delete and then re-create the extension object.
