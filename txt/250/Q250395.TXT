SYMPTOMS
========

A TN3270 client cannot connect to a TN3270 LU after the TN3270 LU is stopped
through SNA Server Manager. The TN3270 LU shows an "Available" status after it
is stopped from within SNA Server Manager, but TN3270 clients cannot use the
session for a connection to the mainframe.

The session remains unavailable until after the TN3270 Idle Timeout expires or
until the TN3270 service is stopped and restarted. The TN3270 Idle Timeout
defaults to two hours.

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 server was not designed to clean up an active TN3270 session when the
session was stopped through SNA Server Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========
