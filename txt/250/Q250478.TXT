SYMPTOMS

   The Application could not find a GPS on your system. Check to ensure that
   your receiver is attached properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

 - Microsoft ActiveSynch 3.0 is installed on your computer.

 - The communications (COM) port to which you connect your GPS device is the
   same COM port that ActiveSynch uses to establish a serial connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods.

Connect Your GPS Device to a Different COM Port
-----------------------------------------------

If your computer has two COM ports, connect your GPS device to a COM port that is
different from the one to which you connect your Microsoft Windows CE device.

Temporarily Disable ActiveSynch
-------------------------------

To temporarily disable ActiveSynch:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Microsoft ActiveSynch.

2. On the File menu, click Connection Settings.

3. Click to clear the "Allow serial cable or infrared connection to this COM
   port" check box.

4. Click OK.

NOTE: You need to select the "Allow serial cable or infrared connection to this
COM port" check box before you synchronize your Windows CE device.
