TITLE   :XADM: Error 80004005 Installing Mailbox Manager After Restore
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager on a restored or
reinstalled server, the following error message may be displayed:

   Unable to install mailbox agent, 80004005

You may receive the following Event message in the Event Viewer Application Log:

   Event ID: 287
   Description: unable to create object mbclean99:alpha because it already
   exists.

The Mailbox Manager object is displayed in the Add-Ins container in the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator program, but the Exchange Server Mailbox Manager
service is not displayed when you double-click Services in Control Panel.

CAUSE
=====

A reinstalled Microsoft Exchange Server computer uses a backup Dir.edb file to
retain the previous configuration of the directory. The Mailbox Manager object
is still present in this Dir.edb file. If you run Setup to remove Exchange
Server Mailbox Manager, Setup does not remove these directory objects.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to reinstall the Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager
service.

Method 1
--------

Start the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Add-Ins container, and
then delete the following items:

 - Mailbox Manager object.

 - Extension for Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Manager for i386.

 - Extension for Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Manager for Alpha.

Method 2
--------

During the new installation of Exchange Server, install the Exchange Server
Mailbox Manager service before you restore the data. Then, restore the Exchange
Server data. This preserves the Exchange Server Mailbox Manager service
configuration from the original installation.
