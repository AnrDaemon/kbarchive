KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user is attempting to download mail from Microsoft Exchange Server by
means of POP3 or IMAP with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled, the user may get
the following error message even though the server certificates have been
installed properly:

   A secure connection to the server could not be established.
   Account: 'accountname' Server: 'servername', Protocol: POP3, Port: 995, Secure
   (SSL): Yes, Error Number: 0x800CCC1A

You may also see the following events logged in the Exchange Server event log:

   EventID: 11508
   Source: MSExchangePOP3
   Description: Accept clients on POP3 interface failed in function
   HrRegisterProtocol with error 0x2741.

   EventID: 1194
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description: Accept client on external interface POP3 failed with error
   0x80004005.

   EventID: 11506
   Source: MSExchange IMAP4
   Description: Accept clients on IMAP4 interface failed in function

   EventID: 1194
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description: Accept client on external interface IMAP4 failed with error
   0x80004005.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused if the Network Associates GroupShield for Microsoft
Exchange virus program is running on the server containing the POP3 mailbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

Completely uninstall GroupShield and attempt to connect to Exchange Server using
the POP3 client with SSL enabled. After you verify that this is successful, you
should be able to re-install GroupShield and have no further problems.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disabling SSL enables the client to download mail if GroupShield cannot be
immediately uninstalled and reinstalled.
