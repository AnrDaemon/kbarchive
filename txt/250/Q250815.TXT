SYMPTOMS

After you install Microsoft Office 2000 Standard, version 2000, or Microsoft
Office 2000 Professional on a computer running Windows 2000, Microsoft Word is
not listed as a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) editor in Internet Explorer 5.0
or 5.01.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\.htm\OpenWithList.

example, http://www.microsoft.com), and then open the file in Word. In the
Office Assistant dialog box, click Yes to make Word your default HTML editor.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Internet Explorer 5.5.
