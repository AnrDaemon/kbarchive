OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Microsoft Internet Explorer on a Microsoft Windows
95-based computer and you already have an older copy of Shdocvw.dll in the
Windows directory, you may find that the setup program does not complete the
installation.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Microsoft Internet Explorer installation
program searches for a Shdocvw.dll in the Windows directory, and if it finds
that file, the installation program stops.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, delete the old Shdocvw.dll file in the Windows
directory and try the installation again.
