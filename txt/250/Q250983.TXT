SUMMARY
=======

The Netscape Web browser implements a proprietary technology known as Server
Push to send a type of dynamic page updates to a client. This technology is not
supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer. However, you can use Server Push with
Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP), or you can Client Pull as an optional
method of displaying dynamic page updates in Internet Explorer.

Server Push Using ASP:

To implement Server Push using ASP, do the following:

1. Save the following code as Push.asp in a folder with at least Script access
   defined:

   <% @Language="VBScript" %>
   <%
     Option Explicit
     Dim strBoundary

     ' change the following string to whatever boundary you wish to use
     strBoundary = "MSBOB"

     ' turn off buffering
     Response.Buffer = False

     ' set the content type as a multipart document
     Response.ContentType = "multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=" & strBoundary

     ' create a function to output the boundary
     Sub WriteBoundary()
       Response.Write "--" & strBoundary & vbCrLf
       Response.Write "Content-Type: text/html" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf
     End Sub

     ' this is a very unelegant sleep function just to create a short delay
     Sub Sleep(tmpSeconds)
       Dim dtmOne,dtmTwo
       dtmOne = Now()
       While DateDiff("s",dtmOne,dtmTwo) < tmpSeconds
         dtmTwo = Now()
       Wend
     End Sub
   %>
   <% WriteBoundary %>
   <html>
   <body>
   <p>First Page</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   <%
     Sleep 10
     WriteBoundary
   %>
   <html>
   <body>
   <p>Second Page</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   <%
     Sleep 10
     WriteBoundary
   %>
   <html>
   <body>
   <p>Third Page</p>
   </body>
   </html>

2. Browse to the page using the Netscape Web browser. The following behavior
   should occur:

    - The first page displays for 10 seconds, and the browser indicates that it
      is still loading a document.

    - The second page displays for 10 seconds, and the browser continues to
      indicate that it is still loading a document.

    - The third page displays, and the browser indicates that the document
      loading has completed.
