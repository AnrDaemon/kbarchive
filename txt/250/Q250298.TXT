SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure settings on the Input Locales tab of the Regional Options
tool, your computer may stop responding (hang). You may receive the following
error message:

   An error occurred while Windows was working with the Control Panel file:

   C:\WINNT\System32\intl.cpl

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you use your keyboard to add a locale.

NOTE: When the Intl.cpl file causes an exception error, Dr. Watson, or the
default debug tool, does not trap the exception error because the error is
handled by the Control.exe file.
