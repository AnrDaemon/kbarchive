   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you debug a default Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC)
AppWizard-generated program, the output window may display the following error
message:

   First-chance exception in <SomeApp>.exe (KERNEL32.DLL): 0xC0000005:
   Access Violation.

CAUSE
=====

The Encompass Monitor or EncMonitor service is preinstalled on some systems.
This service starts Monitor.exe and is loaded before the user logs on to the
system. Monitor.exe performs the same function as the performance monitor Alert
and Logging facility. With this utility, you can generate alerts and log data.
This service causes the first-chance exception that is displayed in the output
window.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around the problem, use any of the following three alternatives:

1. You can ignore the first chance exception message, this message is harmless.
   This message is seen only when you debug programs, and not seen in Release
   versions.

2. You can remove the service and run it manually, whenever needed, to alleviate
   the problem.

3. You can use RegEdit and remove the values "Encompass Monitor" and
   "EncMonitor" from the following Registry keys (do not delete the keys):

Encompass Monitor:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

EncMonitor:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

Before making any modification to the registry, back up the Registry or export
these keys to the Desktop before making any edits.
