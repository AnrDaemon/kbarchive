TITLE   :WD97: Err Msg: "Compile Error in Hidden Module ModMain"
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word8 word97

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, the following error message may
appear:

   Compile error in hidden module: modMain

CAUSE
=====

A third-party program called Voice Xpress may have installed some add-in files
in the Word startup folder. These add-in files are not compatible with Microsoft
Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the Voice Xpress add-in files from the
Office Startup folder. To do this, follow these steps:

NOTE: Word has the ability to automatically load templates, WLLs (Word
libraries), and COM add-ins at startup. These files give Word added
functionality.

1. Quit all Microsoft Office applications.

2. Using the Windows Explorer or My Computer, go to the Office Startup folder.

   The default location for the Office Startup folder is:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Startup

3. Drag the following three files from the Office startup folder to another
   location, such as your Windows Desktop:

    - Wordai.wll
    - Ezpwll32.wll
    - Kword97.wll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
