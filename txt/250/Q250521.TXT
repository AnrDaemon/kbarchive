SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure Exchange Server so that all of the users
in an organization cannot send SMTP e-mail messages to a specific address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure Exchange Server so that all of the users in an organization cannot
send SMTP e-mail messages to a specific address, create a custom recipient and
set delivery restrictions for that recipient:

1. Create an SMTP custom recipient that uses the e-mail address that you want to
   prevent users from sending SMTP e-mail messages to.

2. In the custom recipient properties, click the Delivery Restrictions tab, and
   then perform either one of the following steps:

    - Under "Reject messages from", click List, and then either add everyone in
      the local Recipients container or add a global distribution list (DL) to
      the "Reject messages from" list.

    - Under "Accept messages from", click List, and then add a single user to
      the "Accept messages from" list.

3. Ensure that the display name for the user is the same as the SMTP address
   (for example, someone@microsoft.com).

4. Click the Advanced tab, and then under "Custom recipients options", click to
   select the "Hide from address book" check box.

After you perform these steps, if a user in that organization sends mail to the
SMTP address, the user receives a non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the
following:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject: test
   Sent: 1/10/2000 2:46 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   Someone@microsoft.com on 1/10/2000 2:46 PM
   A restriction in the system prevented delivery of the message.
   The MTS-ID of the original message is: c=US;a=
   ;p=Organization;l=Servername-000110194626Z-183
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:Sitename:Servername
