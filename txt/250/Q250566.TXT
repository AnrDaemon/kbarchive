The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5, 5.01 for Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a local area network (LAN) using RAS or PPTP, you may be
unable to gain access to the Internet if your LAN is using a Proxy server.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Proxy server configuration is not set up on the
client computer for each connection made using RAS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the Internet Explorer icon on your desktop, and then click
   Properties.

2. On the Connections tab, click the Dial-Up Networking connection that you use
   to connect to your LAN, and then click Settings.

3. Under "Proxy server", click the "Use a Proxy server" box, and then add the
   correct address and port that your proxy server uses. In most cases, you may
   also want to click to select the "Bypass proxy server for local connections"
   check box. Check with your network administrator if you are unsure whether
   this entry should be selected. Click to clear the "Automatically detect
   settings" check box. Even if this entry is used on local connections, it
   causes RAS and PPTP connections to fail to connect to the proxy server.

4. Click OK, and then click OK.
