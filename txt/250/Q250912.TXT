WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot

incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, create a registry script file to add an Eastern
Standard Time value to the Time Zones key in the registry using the following
steps:

1. Open Notepad.

2. Copy the following text and paste it into Notepad.

REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Time Zones]
@="Pacific Standard Time"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\Eastern]
"Display"="(GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)"
"Dlt"="Eastern Daylight Time"
"Std"="Eastern Standard Time"
"MapID"="38,39"
"TZI"=hex:2c,01,00,00,00,00,00,00,c4,ff,ff,ff,00,00,0a,00,00,00,05,00,02,00,00,\ 
  00,00,00,00,00,00,00,04,00,00,00,01,00,02,00,00,00,00,00,00,00

3. Save the file with a .reg extension.

   NOTE: When you save the file, use the Save As option on the File menu. In the
   "Save as type" box, click All Files.

4. After you create the file, double-click the file to add the information into
   the registry.
