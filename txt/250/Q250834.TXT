The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Obtaining a list of files that were in a project at a specific time is not
directly supported by the Visual SourceSafe Explorer. The best way to obtain
this information is to use the Visual SourceSafe command line; OLE Automation
could also be used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if you have a project called "$/Project1" and you want to list the
files in it on 5/17/1999, then issue the following command from a DOS window:

C:\>ss dir $/Project1 -vd5-17-99

To get the same project at a label called "TestLabel", issue the following
command from DOS window:

C:\>ss dir $/Project1 -vlTestLabel
