TITLE   :Print Server Hangs After Restarting Spooler Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to a print server, it may stop responding (hang).
When you try to troubleshoot by stopping and then restarting the Spooler
service, the server hangs when the Spooler service restarts. When you try
restarting the server, the server again appears to hang after you type your user
name and password.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Winnt\System32\Spool\Printers folder is very
large. After you restart the Spooler service, it takes a long time to process
all of the print jobs in the Printers folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, delete or move the files in the Printers folder:

1. Restart the print server:

   a. If the server uses the NTFS file system, perform a parallel installation
      and then restart the server to the new installation.

   b. If the server uses the file allocation table (FAT) file system, use an
      MS-DOS boot disk to restart the server.

2. Delete the files in the Winnt\System32\Spool\Printers folder, or move them to
   another location.

   NOTE: If you move the files from the Printers folder, copy a few print jobs at
   a time back to the Printers folder to resume printing.

If you can stop the Spooler service, clear the Winnt\System32\Spool\Printers
service, and then restart the Spooler service.
