======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can install BackOffice Server 4.5 on Windows 2000 Server using the
BackOffice Server 4.5 Readiness Kit for Windows 2000 Server. After you install
BackOffice Server 4.5 using Intranet Collaboration Scenario, you may experience
problems gaining access to resources on the local intranet site.

After you go to the http://<servername>/inetkit site and you click Library
on the toolbar, you are prompted to type your logon credentials. After you type
your user name and password, the same dialog box may appear again and you are
unable to proceed. After you type your credentials three times, the following
error message is displayed:

   You are not authorized to view this page

   You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the
   credentials you supplied.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the selected user does not have Log on Locally
permissions within the domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, give the user Log on Locally permissions for the
domain:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
   Domain Controller Security Policy.

2. Expand Security Settings, expand Local Policies, and then click User Rights
   Assignment.

3. In the right window pane, double-click "Log on Locally".

4. Add the appropriate user. Make sure the user logs off and logs back on before
   attempting to gain access to the intranet site again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem when running Microsoft BackOffice
Server 4.5 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server.
