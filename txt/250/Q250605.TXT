SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores Bugs, the program
may stop responding (hang) when you type your name and then click Go.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if you used a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path name

you installed the program.

To map a drive letter to a network share:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

2. On the Tools menu, click Map Network Drive.

3. In the Drive box, click the drive letter that you want to map to the network
   share.

4. In the Path box, type the following line

   \\<servername>\<sharename>

   where <servername> is the name of the server from which you installed
   the program and <sharename> is the name of the network share from which
   you installed the program.

5. Click to select the "Reconnect at logon" check box.

6. Click OK, and then quit Windows Explorer.
