TITLE   :SMS: Cannot Select Query Result Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms120bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a non-alphanumeric character (such as @ or !) as the first character
in a query name, you cannot select a query result format when you run the query.
For example, if a query is named "@Internet Explorer 4.0 SP1," the Query Result
Format box is empty when you run the query.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem affects only the first query in the list that uses "@" (or any
other special character) as the first character in the query name. To be able to
select query result formats for queries whose name starts with a special
(non-alphanumeric) character, create a "dummy" query with "!" as the query name.
Because queries are displayed alphabetically, the "!" query is listed first and
still exhibits this problem. However, all other queries whose name starts with a
special characters work as expected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
