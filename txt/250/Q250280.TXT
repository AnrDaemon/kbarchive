SUMMARY
=======

Although Input Method Editors (IME) can be installed and used on every version
of Microsoft Windows 2000, they are not installed by default on non-Asian
versions of Windows 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IME and Input Method Manager (IMM) is enabled only when the user has installed
an Asian language pack on Windows 2000. An IME-enabled application can call the
GetSystemMetrics function with SM_IMMENABLED to determine whether IMM is
enabled. SM_IMMENABLED indicates whether the system is ready to use a
Unicode-based IME on a Unicode application. To ensure that a language-dependent
IME works, check SM_DBCSENABLED and the system ANSI CodePage. Otherwise, the
ANSI or Unicode conversion may not be performed correctly, or some components
like fonts or registry setting may not be present.
