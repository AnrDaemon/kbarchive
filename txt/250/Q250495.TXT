TITLE   :PRB: SAVE SCREEN Not Creating Variable on CLEARed Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp500a kbvfp600 kbXBase kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the SAVE SCREEN TO <memory variable> command, the memory
variable might not be created. When using the RESTORE SCREEN FROM <memory
variable> command, you receive the error:

   Variable <memory variable> is not found.

CAUSE
=====

If the screen has been CLEARed, Microsoft Visual FoxPro is not able to save
anything to the memory variable, so it is not created. If the memory variable
already exists, the information in it is not overwritten.

RESOLUTION
==========

Output of some kind to the screen (Visual FoxPro Desktop) enables the SAVE
SCREEN TO command to create the memory variable. The statement:

   ? SPACE(0)

right after the CLEAR command places a null string on the screen and does not
affect screen appearance, but it causes the SAVE SCREEN TO command to create the
memory variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur in Visual FoxPro 3.0b.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program in Visual FoxPro and add the following statements:

   CLEAR ALL
   CLEAR
   * ? SPACE(0) 
   SAVE SCREEN TO X
   ? VERSION()
   RESTORE SCREEN FROM X
   ? TYPE("X")

2. Run the code and note that the error mentioned in the "Symptoms" section
   appears.

3. Remove the asterisk from the line:

   ? SPACE(0)

   and execute the code again.
