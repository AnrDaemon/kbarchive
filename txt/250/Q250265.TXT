SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the the AT Scheduler from a command prompt or a batch
file, you may receive the following error message:

   Initialization of dynamic link library c:\winnt\system32\KERNEL32.dll
   failed.

This behavior can occur when the Schedule service is configured to log on
through a service account, and you change the account password in User Manager
for Domains but not in the Schedule service in Control Panel.

RESOLUTION

To resolve this behavior, change the password of the service account for the
Schedule service in Control Panel to match the password specified for the
account in User Manager for Domains. Follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

2. Select Schedule, and then click Startup.

3. Change the password in the Password and Confirm Password boxes to exactly
   match the password specified for the account in User Manager For Domains, and
   click OK.

4. Click Close to close the Services dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the service account belongs to another domain, add the service account to the
Administrators local group in your domain.
