TITLE   :PRB: VBCE: Deactivate Event Fires when Second Form is Closed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::2.0,2.11,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0, on platform(s):
    - Microsoft Windows CE versions 2.0, 2.11 for the Handheld PC 
    - Microsoft Windows CE version 2.11 for the Palm-size PC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After closing a form that has been shown on top of another form, the Deactivate
event of the form that is being closed fires. This occurs only when the
application is run on the remote device.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, a form level variable can be used to determine
when the event should fire. The following example sets the form level variable
in the QueryUnload event so that the Deactivate event does not fire:

   Dim FireDeactivateEvent

   Private Sub Form_Deactivate()
       If FireDeactivateEvent Then
           MsgBox "Deactivate"
       End If
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       FireDeactivateEvent = True
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_QueryUnload(Cancel As Integer, UnloadMode As Integer)
       FireDeactivateEvent = False
   End Sub

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior only occurs in the Windows CE Platform and only on the remote
device.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Windows CE Project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add the following code behind Form1:

   Private Sub Form_Click()
       Form2.Show
   End Sub

3. Add a second form to the project.

4. Add the following code behind Form2:

   Private Sub Form_Deactivate()
       MsgBox "Deactivate"
   End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the program.

6. Click on Form1 and note that Form2 appears.

7. Close Form2 and note that the message box appears after Form2 is closed.
