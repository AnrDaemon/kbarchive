TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control May Not Work for Component Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remotely control a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
component server, the Remote Tools window may take a long time to open or may
not open at all. In some instances, the window may take over one hour to open.

CAUSE
=====

When the Remote Tools window opens, it runs a query against all the discovery
data for the target computer. There is more discovery data in the database for
component servers than there is for a standard client because of the extra
discovery method (WINNT_SERVER_DISCOVERY) that SMS uses to periodically
rediscover servers acting as site systems. This results in a very large result
set, which in turn results in a delay before the window opens.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A component server is an SMS site system that runs the SMS Executive service.
SMS logon points are also component servers. For more information about
component servers, see the "SMS 2.0 Administrators Guide," Chapter 1.
