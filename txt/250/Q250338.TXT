PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Mdbvu32.exe is a MAPI utility designed to view MAPI messages and folders and
their properties. These messages can be stored in various MAPI store providers
(such as Microsoft Exchange Server). Mdbvu32.exe does not have features to view
rules messages easily (such as those rules produced by Inbox Assistant and the
Rules Wizard). Specifically, the following minor issues are present:

 - Rules are saved as associated messages in a folder (such as the Inbox). Rules
   do not typically have a PR_SUBJECT property, and Mdbvu32 displays the Entry
   ID in a format that resembles the following:

   cb: 40|*pb: EF 00 00 00 00 19 82, and so on

   It is difficult to find a rule when they are listed this way.

 - After you delete a message, focus is reset to the first item in the Messages
   in Folder and Associated Messages in Folder list boxes. If you are deleting
   many rules, it can be time consuming to find the location of your last
   deletion to continue searching for the next rule to delete.

 - When you attempt to delete a rule (or any message that has no PR_SUBJECT
   property), a confirmation dialog box appears with a pull-down list of
   messages to be deleted, and the list is empty. Having no items in the
   confirmation list makes it easier to accidentally delete other messages
   unintentionally.

 - Many MAPI properties are not recognized by Mdbuv32 and are displayed without
   their textual names.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
