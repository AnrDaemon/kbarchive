TITLE   :PDC and BDC Show as Workstations in Server Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0-based network that includes a
primary domain controller (PDC), several backup domain controllers (BDCs), and a
Samba Linux server, the PDC and one of the BDCs may appear as workstations in
Server Manager.

When you run the net accounts command on each computer, each has the correct
server role. However, when you run the net accounts /sync command, the following
information appears in the event log:

   There are currently no logon servers available

When you try to add accounts, promote a BDC, or synchronize in Server Manager,
you receive the following error message:

   The tag is invalid.

Also, when you attempt to start the Netlogon service, you receive the following
error message:

   Error 3097 - A Primary Domain Controller is already running for this domain.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs when you add a Samba server that is configured as PDC to an
existing Windows NT domain. However, Windows NT networking does not allow more
than on PDC per domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, disable the domain controller functionality on the
Samba server. You can accomplish this by changing the following values in the
Samba configuration file (Smb.conf):

   domain master = no preferred master = no domain logons = no
