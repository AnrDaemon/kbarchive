TITLE   :SMS: Online License Metering Won't Work in Multi-Domain Scenario
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsMeter

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users logged on to a Microsoft Systems Management Server site residing in a
trusted domain cannot use software programs that are being metered online in an
account domain group or to single users even though the users have been assigned
permission. When the program is started, the following error message is
displayed:

   This product has had restrictions placed on its use, these restrictions
   prevent you from using this product.

   You are not allowed to use this product.

CAUSE
=====

The License Metering Server is capable of retrieving user groups from multiple
domains, but it does not retain the domain of origin and is unable to determine
group membership from the trusted domain. Therefore, group checks and requests
for permission to run group-assigned programs fail.

When you inspect \Ms\Sms\Logs\Liccli.Log, the following message is displayed:

   Getting groups for the user "LOWRIGHTS"
   OK (0 groups)

When you request an online metered version of Registry Editor, the following
message is displayed:

   Requesting use of "REGEDT32.exe", version: "4.00",lang:0x9,0x4 ...
   ACCESS DENIED
   Request received to terminate app.
   TerminateApp() enumerating app windows.
   Send WM_CLOSE to Registry Editor
   TerminateApp() waiting for app to terminate.
   TerminateApp() checking to see if app terminated in allotted time.
   TerminateApp() closing app process handle.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
