KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbServer kbsms120 kbsms120bug kbDataLoader kbInventory kbsmsUtil

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a site is attached to another site, the inventory is replicated to the
parent site in a process called inventory synchronization. You can also initiate
this process by using the "preinst /syncparent" command as outlined in the
Microsoft Systems Management Server Resource Guide.

In some cases, this process can introduce duplicate records into the inventory
groups within the site database. This can cause unpredictable results when you
attempt to build reports or use the Administrator console to view computer data.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when data is partially inserted before the error condition.
The problem causes the SMS_INVENTORY_DATALOADER thread to continue as if the
site synchronization for the group had never taken place. When this occurs, the
next rows added for the group can have the same data key value as the partially
synchronized data.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the utilities discussed in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article to
remove any duplicate data from the database and allow the normal inventory cycle
to repopulate the data:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
