TITLE   :Windows NT Unavailable on PartitionMagic Dual Boot After Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use PartitionMagic by PowerQuest to partition your hard disk and you
dual boot Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0, and you
then upgrade from Windows 95 to Microsoft Windows 98, you may no longer be able
to gain access to Windows NT 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Windows 98 marks its own partition as the active
partition, leaving PartitionMagic unable to function. Using the Fdisk.exe
utility from Windows 95 or 98 to mark the PartitionMagic partition as active
does not resolve the issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform a parallel installation of Windows NT 4.0. In the original installation,
use Disk Administrator, mark the PartitionMagic partition as active. Delete the
parallel installation.

To work around this behavior, perform a parallel installation of Windows NT 4.0
and use Disk Administrator to mark the PartitionMagic partition in the original
installation as active. Delete the parallel installation.
