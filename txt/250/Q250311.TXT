TITLE   :Setting MA Logging Levels in Microsoft Metadirectory Services
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1

KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Each management agent (MA) has various log files, each one associated with a
different phase of the MA. The most general log file is the Zscript.log file. It
is located in the MA's working folder. The level of detail that is recorded is
controlled by the log level setting within the MA. Increasing the logging level
allows you to record what occurs when the MA runs and then compare that to what
you intended to occur. Generally, you should not raise the logging level above 3
because of the large amount of data generated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are six levels: 0 through 5. The higher levels are cumulative. As the
level increases, the log file contains all of the information from the previous
levels.

 - Level 0 - Displays Zscript echo commands, fatal errors, and summaries.

 - Level 1 - Displays changes that occur during the management run. This is the
   default setting for each MA that is created.

 - Level 2 - Displays all entries by name as they are being processed. This also
   displays attribute flow and joining rules.

 - Level 3 - Displays all entries with full attribute listings.

 - Level 4 - Displays a line-by-line listing from each parsing and construction
   template used during the MA.

 - Level 5 - Displays the MA configuration information and a line-by-line
   interpretation of each construction template used during the MA.

To Set a Higher Logging Level
-----------------------------

1. Use Compass to log on to the Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) server.

2. Click Bookmarks.

3. Click the MA in which you want to increase the logging level.

4. Click Operate MA.

5. Click the Operational Settings tab, and then click the Logging tab.

6. Change the Logging Detail Level setting to the number you want.

7. Click OK to close all the dialog boxes.

NOTE: If you need to increase the logging level to level 4 or higher for
troubleshooting purposes, set the limit to five entries to reduce the amount of
logging that occurs. For additional information, click the article number below
