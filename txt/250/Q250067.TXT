-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the WritePrivateProfileString function is called to update an .ini file in a
folder to which you do not have Delete access, the call does not succeed.
Calling the GetLastError function returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.

CAUSE
=====

WritePrivateProfileString tries to open the file with Delete access. Because you
do not have Delete permissions for the folder, the opening of the file does not
succeed.
