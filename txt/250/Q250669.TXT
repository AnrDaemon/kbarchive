======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you generate a One to Many form with the Microsoft Visual FoxPro 6.0 Form
Wizard and attempt to add a record into the parent table with a key value that
already exists, you might receive the error message listed below:

   Uniqueness of index CUST_ID is violated.

Click the OK button three times and another error message appears:

   SELECT (lnSaveAlias3)
   Error: 12
   Variable 'LNSAVEALIAS3' is not found.
   Method: addrec
   Line: 246

Click the OK button and another error message appears:

   GO lnSaveRec3
   Error: 12
   Variable 'LNSAVEREC3' is not found.
   Method: addrec
   Line: 247

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, you can add the following code to the AddRec method of the
txtBtns class. The txtBtns class can be found in VFP98\Wizards\wizbtns.vcx.

1. On the Tools menu, open the Class Browser.

2. Click the Open button, locate wizbtns.vcx, and click OK.

3. Click on txtbtns in the left pane of the Class Browser.

4. Expand the Methods in the right pane and double-click on the AddRec method.

5. Go to line 29. This should be a blank line. The line above it should be:

   * Start of Code
   THIS.OldRec = RECNO()	&&save record in case reverting 
   * End of Code

6. Add the following code:

   * Start of Code
   * Changes to prevent lnSaveAlias3 and lnSaveRec3 errors if added record already exists
   lnSaveAlias3 = ALIAS()
   lnSaveRec3 = RECNO()
   * End of Code

7. Save wizbtns.vcx.
