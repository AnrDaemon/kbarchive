TITLE   :PRB: Unable to Print to LPT1: Under Windows NT on Motorola
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows NT on some early models of the Motorola PowerPC, printing to the
built-in LPT1: port does not work properly.

An early manufacturing run of the Motorola PowerPC machines had a defect on the
system board that affected the built-in LPT port. Printing to network printers
is not affected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Motorola costumer support at (800) 551-1017 for additional information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The system board problem is on revision 01-W3107F02G. It is the G revision at
the end that is the problem. Use system diagnostics to determine the revision
number of your board.

The symptoms of this problem appear differently. On advanced language laser
printers, such as PostScript and PCL, the data light will turn on and the
printer will appear to be busy, but nothing ever prints. On dot matrix printers,
the printout shows random ASCII characters.
