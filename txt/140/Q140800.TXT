TITLE   :TN3270E Print Job Hangs in Print Manager

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A TN3270E printer session hangs if the Host sends a BIND RU that specifies an
Inbound Maximum RU size of 0 (indicating that no maximum RU size applies on the
session to the Host). This causes the print job to remain in 'Spooling..." state
in the Windows NT Print Manager until the Printer Session is disconnected.

This symptom occurs sporadically.

CAUSE
=====

There are two causes to this problem:

1. The TN3270 Server incorrectly interprets 0 as the maximum RU size which
   prevents it from sending any data to the host. When the host establishes a
   session and specifies the maximum inbound RU size as "no maximum", the
   TN3270E Server treats this as an RU size of zero bytes. This has the effect
   that it ignores all the data it receives from a TN3270 or TN3270E client,
   apart from the 5-byte header in the case of TN3270E.

2. A TN3270E client may also misinterpret this byte and would then be unable to
   send any response to the TN3270 Server. The WRQ emulator is one such
   emulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a fix for cause number one and two:

1. The fix for cause number 1 ensures that the TN3270 sends inbound data. The
   data is sent in Request Units (RUs) up to the "Default Inbound RU Size"
   specified in the "Options" dialog of TN3270 Admin.

2. To work around the second cause, the client problem, the TN3270 Server has a
   registry entry that allows a 0 RU size in the BIND image transmitted to the
   client to be overwritten by the "Default Inbound RU Size" specified in the
   "Options" dialog of TN3270 Admin. You can find the registry entry under the
   subtree HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the subkey:

   CurrentControlSet\Services\TN3270\Parameters

   The registry value is as follows:

   Value Name: ReplaceRUSize
   Data Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ

   If this entry is set to "ON" then the value for the inbound RU size in the
   BIND Image sent to the TN3270E client is set to the default inbound RU size
   as configured for the TN3270E Server, if the host has specified no maximum.

   Set this registry entry only if you experience this problem.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

 - <TN3270Root>\TN3SERVR.EXE

 - <TN3270Root>\TN3SERVR.DBG

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
