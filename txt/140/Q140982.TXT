The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you run a presentation conference, each audience machine receives an entire
copy of the presentation, including hidden slides. After the presentation
conference is over, or if an audience machine breaks out of the conference, the
audience machines retain that presentation and can display those hidden slides.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The presenter can choose any hidden slide from the original presentation by
clicking the slide number or name and clicking the Go To button in the Slide
Navigator. The hidden slides have parentheses around the slide number. After the
presenter selects a hidden slide, the slide is then visible to the audience
computer.

The first slide of the original presentation splashes on the audience's screen
after the presenter's computer downloads a temp file. The audience computer then
synchronizes with the slide displayed on the presenter's computer. The Stage
Manager does not display any of the previous slides on the audience computers;
however, the slides can be accessed through the Slide Navigator.

The slide displayed on the presenter's computer at the start of the conference is
considered the first slide by the Stage Manager. Even if it has a hidden
attribute, the slide is available throughout the conference using the Stage
Manager.

If the first slide of the original presentation is a hidden slide and the
presenter is not starting the presentation with that slide on the screen, it
still splashes on the audience computers once, but is then no longer visible
during the conference unless specifically chosen through the Slide Navigator by
the presenter.
