SYMPTOMS
========

This patch fixes three different types of Visual C++ 4.0 Developer Studio
crashing problems. The scenarios are described below:

1. When the current project has sub-projects and the create browser file option
   is turned on, the Developer Studio may randomly generate an access violation.
   This can happen in response to one of the following actions:

   a. Building the project.

   b. Closing the project, including closing MSDEV.

   c. Opening a different project or creating a new project.

   d. Saving all the files using the Save All command.

2. When stopping a debugging session then restarting a new debugging session
   with a project loaded, the Developer Studio fails with an access violation.
   The error message could be something like :

   

   msdev.exe -  Application Error.
   The instruction at "0x77f85064" referenced memory at "0x00000010".
        The memory could not be "read".

   Restarting a new debugging session, the Developer Studio will crash with the
   following error message :

   Microsoft Developer Studio
   (NTDLL.DLL): OxC0000005: Access Violation.

3. When deleting sub-projects from a main project, the Developer Studio may
   sometimes crash with an access violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Download the self-extracting patch file to a temporary directory.

2. Run VCPATCH.EXE. This will create three files : patch.exe, patch.rtp, and
   readme.txt.

3. Copy patch.exe and patch.rtp to the \msdev\bin directory.

4. Run patch.exe. The patch will modify the MSVCBLD.PKG file in the
   \msdev\bin\ide directory. It will also modify the MSVCCLS.PKG file in the
   \msdev\bin\ide directory and the MSVCSRC.DLL in the \msdev\bin directory.

5. Delete patch.exe and patch.rtp from \msdev\bin directory.

Note: You need to close the Developer Studio when applying the patch. Otherwise
the files will not be modified.

This patch should be applied to the English version of Visual C++ 4.0 only.

These problems were fixed in Visual C++ 4.1.
