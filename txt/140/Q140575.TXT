TITLE   :PRB: Connectivity Error: Not a Recognized Built-in Function
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.5,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbMDAC250

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to run or browse a remote view, you may receive a Connectivity error
similar to this one:

   Connectivity error: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]'CTOD' is
   not a recognized built-in function name

CAUSE
=====

The CTOD function is added by the user as one of the Output fields, Order By, or
Group By fields, or it is added by the View Designer as part of the Selection
Criteria. CTOD is a FoxPro-specific function that is not recognized by the SQL
Server.

When browsing the Remote View, FoxPro passes the SQL command (listed in the
Remote View SQL window) to the back-end server for execution. A connectivity
error message is generated when any of the FoxPro-specific functions are passed
to the back-end server.

RESOLUTION
==========

The View Designer problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 3.0 for Windows is
fixed in Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 3.0b for Windows. In version 3.0, the
view designer added the CTOD to the WHERE clause whenever a Selection Criteria
on a Datetime field is added to the view. Version 3.0b does not add the CTOD
automatically. Currently, 3.0b requires that the date in the example be
surrounded by single quotation marks.

Steps to Work Around Problem
----------------------------

1. Create an updatable View using SQL Passthrough. Use one of the SQL Server
   built-in functions or remove whatever the View Designer added.

   For information about creating an updatable View, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q138094 How to Create Updatable Views by Using SQL Passthrough

   Following is an example of an SQLEXEC command that queries the Employee table
   for a range of dates in the Hire_date field and then returns only the date
   portion of the datetime field:

         =SQLEXEC(Handle, "SELECT emp_id, ;
            STR(datepart(month,hire_date),2) + '/';
            + STR(datepart(day,hire_date),2) + '/' ;
            + STR(datepart(year,hire_date),4) AS 'The_hire_date' ;
            FROM employee ;
            WHERE hire_date >= '01/01/93' AND hire_date <= '12/31/93'")

   Note: STR() and datepart() are Microsoft SQL Servers built-in functions.

2. Remove all FoxPro-specific functions from the Remote View.

3. Create a Local view based on the Remote View.

4. Add the necessary functions or selection criteria to the Local View.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Remote View to a Microsoft SQL Server.

2. Add some fields to the Selected Output using the Functions/Expressions
   window, and use a FoxPro function such as ALLTRIM or DTOC.

3. Add Selection Criteria using a Datetime type field.

4. Browse the view.
