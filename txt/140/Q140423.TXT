======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use SNA Server client and IBM CA/400 (V3R1), you are prompted to enter
a User ID and password. If your user ID has nine or less characters, you are
able to log on. If your user ID has ten characters, the following error
appears:

   SNA Server EHNAPPC Security
   7003 Cannot assign a network drive

If you choose OK, the user ID and password prompt appears again. This time only
the first nine characters of the user ID appear in the User ID box.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Win 3.x EHNAPPC interface does not properly handle AS/400 signon
if the AS/400 userid is ten characters in length. The tenth character is
truncated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem (on Windows
3.1x clients):

   <winroot>\SYSTEM\EHNAPPC.DLL
   <winroot>\SYSTEM\EHNRTRW.DLL

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
