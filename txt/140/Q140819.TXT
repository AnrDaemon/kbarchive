TITLE   :Systems Management Server is Unable to Get Global Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.10
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.10 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Systems Management Server is unable to obtain a domain controller address
(via the browser service), Systems Management Server is unable to get global
groups.

For example:

Assume a Windows for Workgroups client is on a network segment, and a logon
domain server is on a different segment connected through a router. The
computers are running TCP/IP as their only protocol, and are using the LMHOSTS
file for name resolution. There is also a resource domain on the client segment
to which inventory is reported through SMSLS.INI mapping. Further assume there
are no computers on the client segment acting as Segment Master Browser for the
logon domain, (which thus causes domain-wide browsing to fail.)

CAUSE
=====

The failure occurs because SMS Program Group Control (PGC) issues a browse list
request (NetServerEnum2 API call) to look for domain controllers in the logon
domain, yet there is no Segment Master Browser to respond. The router prevents
browse request broadcasts from propagating to other segments, so no browse list
is ever received.

NOTE: for more information on browsing with LMHOSTS files, see Q150800 - Domain
Browsing with TCP/IP and LMHOSTS Files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
