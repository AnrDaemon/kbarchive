SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, you may find it difficult to use the mouse to undock a toolbar or
the Project Manager. Also, you may want to use code to dock or undock a built-in
toolbar or the Project Manager. This article explains how to dock and undock
toolbars and the Project Manager programatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A toolbar or the Project Manager may be docked or undocked by using the MOUSE
command. To dock or undock the Standard Toolbar, type the following line in the
Command window:

   MOUSE DBLCLICK AT 0.1,0.1 WINDOW "Standard"

The command must be a bit more specific when referring to the Project Manager
because the window name of the Project Manager changes with the project name. To
open the Tastrade project, use this command:

      MODIFY PROJECT HOME()+'samples\mainsamp\tastrade.pjx'

To dock the Tastrade Project, use this command:

      MOUSE DBLCLICK AT -0.1,0.1 WINDOW "PROJECT MANAGER - TASTRADE"

To undock the Tastrade Project, use this command:

      MOUSE DBLCLICK AT 0.1,0.1 WINDOW "PROJECT MANAGER - TASTRADE"

NOTE: In this last example, you could have just used the window name PROJECT.
However, if there is more than one project open and only PROJECT is used, Visual
FoxPro picks one of the projects at random to dock or undock. You need to use
the complete name to guarantee that a particular project is docked or undocked.
