SYMPTOMS

When you run Performance Monitor against an SNA Server, Winlogon traps after
several hours of operation. The SNA Server services continue to run. However,
the following symptoms occur:

 - Users are not able to logon locally to the SNA Server.

 - RPC services such as the following do not function:

    - When Performance Monitor gathers details.

    - When you try to view events in the system, security, or application logs.

This symptom occurs sporadically.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the way the SNA performance DLL is passing information to
Performance Monitor.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNAPERF.DLL to correct
this problem.
