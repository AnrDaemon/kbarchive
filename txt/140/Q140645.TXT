 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you type in an international version of Microsoft Word 97, the screen
flickers and CPU usage is at or near 100 percent.

CAUSE
=====

The Check Grammar As You Type option is turned on. When Word encounters certain
groups of characters, the Grammar Checker does not stop and continues processing
the document; this continuous processing causes screen flickering and heavy CPU
usage.



RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2).

To temporarily work around the screen flicker and heavy CPU usage problem, turn
off the Check Grammar As You Type option. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Spelling & Grammar
   tab.

2. Under Grammar, click to clear the Check Grammar As You Type check box.

3. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97
Service Release 2 (SR-2).
