SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the configuration of the Microsoft 16-bit DLC (MSDLC)
protocol with Windows 95 based on a prior IBM DLC protocol installation. This
article assumes that an NDIS2 (real-mode) network card driver is in use and that
the MSDLC protocol will be bound to either an Ethernet or Token-Ring network
card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DLC protocol exposes the DLC interface commonly used for connectivity to
AS/400 and mainframe computer systems. This protocol cannot be used for Windows
95 client connectivity or to share files or printers with the File and Printer
Sharing services in Windows 95.

If the IBM DLC protocol is currently installed, the following steps can be used
to install a network card driver in Windows 95 and install the MSDLC protocol
driver:

1. Disable any of the following lines that appear in the Config.sys file by
   placing "REM" at the beginning of each such line. NOTE: Do not delete these
   lines as they may be necessary for reference.

      DEVICE=C:\<DLC_DIRECTORY>\DXMA0MOD.SYS
      DEVICE=C:\<DLC_DIRECTORY>\DXMC0MOD.SYS  (for Token-Ring adapters)
      DEVICE=C:\<DLC_DIRECTORY>\DXME0MOD.SYS  (for Ethernet adapters)
      DEVICE=C:\<DLC_DIRECTORY>\DXMTOMOD.SYS  (for NetBIOS functionality)
      DEVICE=C:\<DLC_DIRECTORY>\DXMJ0MOD.SYS  (occasionally used instead
                                               of Dxmt0mod.sys)

   An example of a disabled line should look like this:

      REM DEVICE=C:\<DLC_DIRECTORY>\DXMA0MOD.SYS

2. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

3. Click the existing IBM DLC protocol, and then click Remove.

4. Click Add, click Protocol, and then click Add.

5. In the Manufacturers box, click Microsoft. In the Network Protocols box,
   click Microsoft DLC, and then click OK.

6. Click OK, and then click Yes.

After Windows 95 restarts, you are ready to configure the Microsoft DLC
protocol.

Configuring the Microsoft DLC Protocol
--------------------------------------

The following table outlines the standard DLC protocol settings and the
corresponding MSDLC Advanced property parameters:

   DLC.T2 T2=                       t2_tick_one for first adapter
                                    t2_tick_two for second adapter
   DLC.TI TI=                       ti_tick_one for first adapter
                                    ti_tick_two for second adapter
   TRANSMIT.TIMEOUT TT=             class1timeout

Token-Ring Adapters
-------------------

Dxmc0mod.sys addr0, mem0, etr0, addr1, mem1, etr1

This driver is used to set parameters for Token-Ring adapters that must be set
differently depending on which Token-Ring adapter is in use. The parameters can
be configured as follows:

   addr0 - This parameter specifies the Locally Administered Address
           (LAA) and can be set using the NETADDRESS keyword in the
           Protocol.ini file. For additional information on Token-Ring
           network adapters and LAAs, please see the following article
           in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q93039 Token-Ring Cards and Local Addressing with WFWG

   mem0 - This parameter specifies the upper memory address used by the
          Token-Ring adapter.

   etr0 - This parameter specifies whether or not Early Token Release is
          in use on the Token-Ring adapter.

The remaining parameters are used with the second Token-Ring adapter.

Ethernet Adapters
-----------------

Dxme0mod.sys addr0, wrk0, xmit_swap0, addr1, wrk1, xmit_swap1

This driver is used to set parameters for an Ethernet adapter when the adapter is
being handled by a Windows 95 NDIS2 adapter driver. The parameters can be
configured as follows:

   addr0 - This parameter can be set using the NETADDRESS keyword in the
           Protocol.ini file.

   wrk0 - This parameter specifies the work space area in kilobytes
          (KB).

   xmit_swap0 - This parameter determines whether destination address
                bits are swapped, and whether 802.3 or Ethernet DIX 2.0
                frames are sent.

      0 - Transmit 802.2 frames and swap address bits (default).

      1 - Transmit Ethernet DIX frames and swap address bits.

      2 - Transmit 802.3 frames and do not swap address bits.

      3 - Transmit Ethernet DIX frames and do not swap address bits.

Depending on the value of xmit_swap0, you should set the MSDLC parameters as
follows:

   Dxme0mod.sys Setting   MSDLC Setting
   ----------------------------------------------
   xmit_swap0 = 0         usedix = 0 and swap = 1
   xmit_swap0 = 1         usedix = 1 and swap = 1
   xmit_swap0 = 2         usedix = 0 and swap = 0
   xmit_swap0 = 3         usedix = 1 and swap = 0

Failure to set the appropriate MSDLC parameters correctly could cause DLC
applications to fail when trying to connect to a host system.

Dxma0mod.sys
------------

This driver is primarily used for interrupt 0x5C arbitration. Therefore, no
Windows 95 drivers need to be installed in lieu of this driver.
