SYMPTOMS
========

On your Windows NT version 3.51 computer, when you connect to an OS/2 1.3 LAN
Manager version 2.2b server and view a directory in File Manager, not all files
are displayed. At the command line, if you execute the DIR command on this
directory, a "File not found" error message appears.

with a distinct number of files. The number of files differ from one Windows NT
boot to the next.
