receive the following error message:

   Cannot display this Help file. Try opening the Help file again, and if you
   still get this message, copy the Help file to a different drive, and try
   again. (136)

open on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use any one of the following methods:

 - Copy the Help file to a different name or location.

 - Close the Help file on the computer running Windows NT.

 - Change the access type for the network share to read-only.
