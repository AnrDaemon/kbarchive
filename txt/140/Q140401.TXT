PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:3.0,3.5,3.51

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use TCP/IP only on an MS Network Client 3.0 or 3.11, the results of the
command NET DIAG /STATUS show 0 packets transmitted and 0 packets received.

The following example output is from an MS Network Client installed from the
Windows NT 3.51 Server compact disc with the TCP/IP protocol only. The command
entered from the MS-DOS prompt is NET DIAG /STATUS to examine the local adapter
status:

   Remote Adapter STATUS

Permanent node name: 08002B33257E

   Adapter operational for 0 minutes.
   254 Free ncbs out of 254 with 254 the maximum.
   1 Sessions in use
   6 Sessions allocated
   0 packets transmitted 0 packets received.
   0 retransmissions 0 retrys exhausted.
   0 crc errors 0 alignment errors 0 collisions 0 Aborted transmissions.
   name 2 LCTIMDI2 status 04
   name 3 AGGIELAND status 84
   The command completed successfully.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and see the number of packets transmitted and
received, use NetBEUI instead of the TCP/IP protocol.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Network Client versions 3.0 and
3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
