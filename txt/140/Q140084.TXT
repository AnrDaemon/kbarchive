PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.00 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The following error message appears when you attempt to create an LPR printer:

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

   Specified Port cannot be added. Access Denied.

Windows NT3.51
--------------

   You do not have permissions to add a port to this machine

To create a TCP/IP printer in Windows NT, you must be a member of the
Administrators or Server Operators group.

CAUSE
=====

Printer Operators and Power Users can create printers but do not have sufficent
access to the registry to create new printer ports.

Print Operators are also unable to create a DLC port. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q160142
   TITLE : Printer Operators Cannot Create DLC Ports

WORKAROUND
==========

Have the Administrator create the port before the Printer Operator or Power User
creates a printer.

Or

Use the following steps to modify the default permissions to give Print Operators
and Power Users the ability to create an LPR port.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Logon to the computer as an Administrator and run REGEDT32.EXE

2. Go to the following registry location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print

3. Select the Monitors Key under the Print Key

4. From the Security Menu select Permissions

5. Select Add then select the Print Operators group or Power Users group, set
   the Type of Access to "Full Control" then choose OK.

6. Select the option to "Replace Permissions on Existing Subkeys" Then choose
   OK.

7. Stop then restart the spooler service.

Print Operators and/or Power Users will now be able to add an LPR Port.
