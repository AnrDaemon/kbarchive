TITLE   :PC Win: CONVERT.EXE Not Converting Folders with Mac Attachment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2a,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The CONVERT.EXE utility dated 06/09/95, included with Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, does not reliably convert Macintosh user-created private postoffice
folders containing large Macintosh attachments.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, under certain
circumstances, will create erroneous Federal Information Processing Systems
(FIPS) message attachment header fields in private folders. The fields will
appear to be valid. However, they will not actually point to any valid
attachment, and the data contained within the FIPS attachment field will be
random. The attempt to read by CONVERT.EXE results in random data from within
the folder being read as an attachment, or it attempts to read past the end of
the folder itself.

The size of the message folder may have some effect on the problem, where
messages with smaller attachments appear to convert correctly. The CONVERT.EXE
utility is a shell that calls MSSFS.DLL from the Windows client to do the actual
conversion. The following error will occur during a failed conversion:

   The folder conversion process was halted by an error while copying.
   No folders or messages were converted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CONVERT.EXE dated 06/09/95 and
version 3.5 of MSSFS.DLL. This problem was corrected in version 3.5.4092 or
later of MSSFS.DLL.

To obtain this updated file, please contact your Microsoft Technical Account
Manager (TAM) or Product Support Services (PSS).
