PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetworkkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When shutdown is initiated on a Windows NT computer running TCP/IP, Name Release
notification for NetBIOS Names used by the Workstation Service
COMPUTERNAME<00>, Messenger service COMPUTERNAME<03> and the
Domain<1C> are never sent to the WINS server.

WINS displays these names as active when in fact the computer was shut down.
Proper registration and release of names help avoid WINS replication problems.
