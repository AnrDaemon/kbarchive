SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use NETSVC.EXE to control and display Windows NT
services on a local or a remote computer.

You may also use NETSVC.EXE to view current driver status.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NETSVC.EXE is a command line utility which allows you to administer and query
services on a Windows NT workstation or server.

In order to use this utility, you must first have adequate permissions on the
target computer. In most cases, Local Administrator equivalencies are required.

SYNTAX: NETSVC servicename \\computername /command

Available command options:

   /query      Queries the status of the service
   /start      Starts the service
   /stop       Stops the service
   /pause      Pauses the service
   /continue   Starts the paused service
   /list       Lists installed services and drivers

Additionally, the /list option can be followed by the > command and a filename
to write the output to file. For example:

   NETSVC \\ABRAMELIN /LIST > SERVICES.TXT

NETSVC is available on the Windows NT Resource Kit CD-ROM under the \platform
(x86, alpha, ppc, mips) \netadmin subdirectory, or on the SMS 1.1 CD-ROM, under
the \PSSTOOLS\X86.BIN for x86 computers.

NOTE: The SMS CD-ROM contains the X86 version only.

Additional query words: sms prodsms
