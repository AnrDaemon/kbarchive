TITLE   :LPD L Command Is Not Passed with EnableBannerPages Disabled
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If EnableBannerPages has been disabled for TCP/IP printing, the L command is not
sent and the print job will not be passed through the Windows NT server.

WORKAROUND
==========

Enable the Banner Page setting to restore "l" control command. The Windows NT
Print Manager LPR Port monitor software sends the "l" control command by default
(because most jobs sent through Print Manager come from Windows- based
applications). Because Windows-based applications use a Windows NT printer
driver to fully render the print job, the "l" control command is used to
indicate that the LPD server should pass the job through unaltered.

NOTE: The above reference to "l" is a lowercase "L".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
