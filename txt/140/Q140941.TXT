TITLE   :XCLN: Identifying Exportable Client Versions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange version 4.0, the Microsoft Exchange client does not
display which version of the client (US, French, German, International, and so
forth) is installed. This makes assessing whether the installed client complies
with current US export law (regarding encryption methods) more difficult.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 2. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once the service pack is applied, you can view the currently installed version
by clicking the Tools menu, clicking Options, and clicking the Security tab. It
will be reported as either the "North American version" or the "International
version".
