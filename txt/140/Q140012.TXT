TITLE   :ScanDisk in Setup Does Not Scan DriveSpace 3 Drive's MDFAT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 95 over an existing installation of Windows 95 on a
hard disk compressed with DriveSpace 3, the version of ScanDisk run by Setup can
check only the FAT for potential errors. The version of ScanDisk run by Setup
cannot check the MDFAT. If you did not update your Windows 95 Startup Disk with
Microsoft Plus!, the same situation occurs with the version of ScanDisk on the
Startup Disk.

CAUSE
=====

The version of ScanDisk run by Setup is not designed to work with DriveSpace 3.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before you run Setup again, run ScanDisk with the Thorough option on all drives,
including the compressed drive and its host drive. Run ScanDisk from the System
Tools menu, or from your Startup Disk (if it was upgraded with Microsoft Plus!).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The version of ScanDisk run by Setup checks only the cluster-based file
allocation table (FAT) on drives compressed with DriveSpace 3. Because
DriveSpace 3 uses a Microsoft DoubleSpace FAT (MDFAT) for sector allocation,
ScanDisk cannot check portions of the compressed drive for errors.

Note that the version of ScanDisk run by Setup can check drives compressed with
DriveSpace and DoubleSpace (but not DriveSpace 3). ScanDisk checks drives
compressed with third-party compression (such as SuperStor or Stacker) as normal
FAT drives only.
