TITLE   :NetWare Search Mapping Works Only in Current MS-DOS Session
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the NetWare MAP command in an MS-DOS session to set a search path,
the search path is retained only for the current MS-DOS session.

CAUSE
=====

Using MAP to add a Search Drive mapping sets an environment variable. Such
settings created inside an MS-DOS session are used for that MS-DOS session only.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place the command to map a search drive in your login script.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks. This
behavior does not apply to the MAP command if used simply to associate a drive
letter with a NetWare resource; it applies only to the MAP command when used to
associate a drive letter with a NetWare resource and add that drive to the
search path (equivalent to the MS-DOS path).

The following are examples of mapping a "normal", non-search drive:

   MAP Q:=CLARICE/DATA:WIN95
   MAP ROOT R:=CLARICE/DATA:WIN95

The following are examples of mapping a search drive:

   MAP S16:=CLARICE/SYS:PUBLIC
   MAP INS S4:=CLARICE/SYS:PUBLIC\NLS
   MAP ROOT INS S1:=CLARICE/SYS:APPS\WORKS
