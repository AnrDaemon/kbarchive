TITLE   :Remote Control Clients Are Grayed Out in SMS after Applying SP1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smshowto

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Systems Management Server Service Pack 1 to a site server
running Systems Management Server 1.10, some of your remote control clients show
up with a gray background when you use the Systems Management Server admin tools
from a workstation that has not been updated.

Using remote control from the site server or secondary servers works properly.

CAUSE
=====

Service Pack 1 updates the associated files on the site server and all secondary
servers, but not on admin workstations.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must copy the files from Service Pack 1 to the
admin workstation manually:

1. On your admin workstation, rename SIGHTNT.DLL, and SMSRES.DLL in the
   SMSADMIN\SITE.SRV\X86.BIN directory to a unique name.

2. Copy SIGHTNT.DLL, SMSRES.DLL from the Systems Management Server site server
   to the workstation to the SMSADMIN\SITE.SRV\X86.BIN directory.
