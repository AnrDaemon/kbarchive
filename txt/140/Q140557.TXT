Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a copy of the information in a press release concerning
the Windows 95 password list security issue.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Background
----------

The Windows 95 password list is a password cache. When a user first types and
saves a password while connecting to a password protected resource, Windows 95
caches the password in the password list file. Logging on with a Windows 95
password unlocks the list and associates those passwords with the Windows 95
password. To the user, it seems as if the passwords for Windows 95 and the
password protected resources are the same. If password caching is disabled,
users must type the passwords each time they connect to a password protected
resource.

Recently, an algorithm was posted on the Internet which can be used to compromise
the security used in the password list file. If someone can access the .pwl file
on the hard disk of a Windows 95 machine, they may be able to perform operations
on the file that can generate the unencrypted password(s).

The Windows 95 password file is only vulnerable when access is available to the
.pwl file on the Windows 95 machine's disk.

Microsoft recommends that customers who are concerned about this issue disable
password caching until an updated component is installed.

Password caching can be disabled by using the system policy editor (as described
in the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit, page 471) or with the registry editor
by adding the following key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\
   Network\DisablePwdCaching = 1

NOTE: The DisablePwdCaching value should be added as a DWord value.

Replacement Component
---------------------

Microsoft has released a replacement component (Mspwlupd.exe) that will ensure
that the password list is secure. For additional information about obtaining the
replacement component, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Warnings
--------

You can edit the registry using System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) or Registry
Editor (Regedit.exe). Check with your network administrator before you make any
changes to the registry.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you
to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from
the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your
own risk.

System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) is available in the Admin\Apptools\ Poledit
folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control
Panel to install System Policy Editor.

NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version of Windows
95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting executable file containing
Poledit.exe, from online services. Please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about downloading Policy.exe:
