TITLE   :Run Command On Workstation Job Doesn't Refresh....
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following incorrect behavior applies only to "Run Command On Workstation"
jobs and does not happen with "Share Package On Server" jobs.

When you take an existing package, one that has previously been distributed to a
machine group, and try to refresh that package on a new group that contains a
partial list of servers from the original group, the distribution servers are
not refreshed.

The SMS Despooler processed the instruction file but fails to decompress the
package and copy any files.

This occurs when only the "Put on Specified Distribution Servers" is selected in
the Distribute phase of the Job Details window.

NOTE: If you select "Refresh Existing Distribution Servers" the package is
distributed to all the original distribution servers regardless of the machine
group selected in the drop down box within that dialog.

WORKAROUND
==========

If it is necessary to refresh certain distribution servers, Select "Refresh
Existing Distribution Servers" in the Distribute Phase of the Job Details
window. This refreshes all original distribution servers for this package.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
