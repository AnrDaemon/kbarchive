TITLE   :PRB: MFC 4.0 Applications Can't Be Run Under Windows NT 3.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeyword kbMFC kbOSWinNT350 kbVC kbGrpDSMFCATL

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to run an MFC 4.0 application under Windows NT version 3.5 generates
the following error message:

   The procedure entry point GetProcessVersion could not be located in the
   dynamic link library KERNEL32.DLL.

Followed by:

   The application failed to initialize properly [0x0000139], click OK to
   terminate application.

CAUSE
=====

MFC 4.0 is not compatible with Windows NT 3.5. There were many new features
added to this version of MFC that require operating system support capabilities
that do not exist in Windows NT 3.5. This includes, but is not limited to, the
new Win32 common controls that are now used as an integral part of the Microsoft
Foundation Classes.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
