TITLE   :Windows 95 AFTP Client Reports WINAPPC.DLL is Corrupt
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the Windows 95 SNA Server client you receive the following
error when running AFTP:

   The c:\sna95\system\winappc.dll file appears to be corrupt.
   Reinstall the file and try again.

This problem occurs sporadically.

CAUSE
=====

There is a Win16-bit version of WINAPPC.DLL present on your Win32-bit platform
(that is, Windows 95 or Windows NT). The AFTP client links to the 16-bit
WINAPPC.DLL but expects a 32-bit version of WINAPPC.DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

AFTP.EXE has been modified so that it now calls WAPPC32.DLL directly.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\AFTP.EXE
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\AFTPAPI.EXE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
