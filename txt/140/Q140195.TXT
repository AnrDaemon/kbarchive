TITLE   :PRB: The Word "Setup" Is Appended to Application Title
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run the Setup Wizard and create a set of distribution disks for your
application and then run setup from this set of disks, the word "Setup" follows
your application title. It is also displayed in the title bar of the application
setup window.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup Wizard appends the word "Setup" to the user-supplied title string.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. There is no way to prevent the Setup Wizard from
appending the word "Setup" to the title string.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you add the word "Setup" to the title string that the Setup Wizard requests
for your application, it appears twice in the title bar of the setup window. One
occurrence of the word is from the string you provided, and the other one is
inserted by the Setup Wizard.

For example, during the Setup Wizard process, you enter the string "My
Application Setup" when the Setup Wizard asks for the title of your application.
When setup is run from the resulting disk set, the string "My Application Setup
Setup" is displayed in the title bar of the setup window.

The Setup Wizard does not indicate that the word "Setup" is added to the final
string presented to end users when they install your application.
