TITLE   :FIX: Can't Save 'Assume Project Based on Working Dir' Setting
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400bug kbSSafe500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you log on as Admin, the option "Assume Project based on working directory"
cannot be saved by using the Command Line Options tab dialog box reached by
clicking Options on the Tools menu.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a conflict in the Ss.ini file settings:

   Force_Dir (CL) = Yes

   Force_Prj = Yes

These two settings conflict because the Force_Dir setting forces the current
directory to change to the current project's working directory, whereas the
Force_Prj setting forces the current project to change to the project where the
working directory matches the current directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the desired command line option manually in the Ss.ini file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual SourceSafe 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Install Visual SourceSafe 4.0, Build 0831, under Windows 95.

2. Run the 32-bit Ssexp.exe program and log on as admin.

3. On the Tools menu, click Options, then click the Command Line Options tab.

4. Select the Assume Project Based on Working Directory check box, and click OK.

5. On the Tools menu, click Options again. You will see that the Assume Project
   Based on Working Directory check box is clear, but the Assume Working
   Directory Based on Current Project setting is selected.
