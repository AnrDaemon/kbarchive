TITLE   :XCON: MTA Mishandles Use of Default Dialogue-mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server is unable to communicate with a remote Message
Transfer Agent (MTA) over an X.400 connector. In some cases you might be able to
send to the foreign MTA, but it cannot receive messages. This is the case with
the MEMO MTA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem only happens when the remote MTA does not explicitly send the
dialogue mode in the SPDU Connect packet. This fact can be verified by tracing
the beginning of the X.400 connection.

One workaround is to configure both MTAs to the "two way alternate" dialogue
mode.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
