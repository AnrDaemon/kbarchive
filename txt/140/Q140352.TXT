TITLE   :BUG: RC1120: RC Out of Memory When Compiling for Macintosh
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbHWMAC kbVCkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling a resource script (.rc file), the resource compiler gives the
following error message:

   RC : fatal error RC1120 : out of memory, needed xxxx bytes

This error happens only when compiling for a Macintosh or a Power Macintosh
target. Also, the error occurs on large .rc files only.

RESOLUTION
==========

Break the large .rc file into multiple smaller .rc files. Breaking an .rc file
into two .rc files can be done conveniently by using Developer Studio's Resource
Editor. Because the Resource Editor supports drag and drop between two .rc
files, move the resources from one .rc file to another.

Developer Studio's build system does not support including more than one .rc
files. Include only one .rc file in the project. Instead of including the second
.rc file, compile it from command prompt and include the resulting .rsc file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
