TITLE   :COPYEMBED From AutoCAD LT Works Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Using AutoCAD LT or AutoCAD for Windows, when pasting into another Windows
application the pasted image may not be proportional to the image that was
copied from AutoCAD. This works correctly using Windows NT 3.1 or Windows 3.11.

CAUSE
=====

The COPYEMBED command does not function properly under Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51.
The COPYEMBED command is used to paste an object from AutoCAD to other Windows
applications. However, under Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51, when a COPYEMBED command
is executed, or the Copy Embed option is chosen from the Edit menu, the entire
work area is copied, instead of the selected area.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

 - Use the COPYIMAGE command, or Copy Image from the Edit menu, to copy a bitmap
   image of the object, but not the object itself, like COPYEMBED does.

   -or-

 - Upgrade to the latest version of AutoCAD.

STATUS

We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
