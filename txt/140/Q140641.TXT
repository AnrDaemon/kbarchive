SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to change passwords on a Windows NT Server from AppleTalk or Banyan
Vines clients, the attempt fails.

CAUSE
=====

Previous versions of Samsrv.dll did not have support for AppleTalk or Banyan
vines applications that made Security Account Manager (SAM) API calls to change
passwords. This fix was primarily included for Exchange clients that were having
problems changing their user passwords on these networks.

WORKAROUND
==========

Obtain the fix mentioned below, or upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server
version 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
