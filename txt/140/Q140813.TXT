TITLE   :Windows Fails w/ Black Screen After Upgrade from SMS 1.0 to 1.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you quit Windows a black screen appears without any text. If you press
CTRL+ALT+DEL a blue screen appears with the dialog box:

   'WARNING!' The system is either busy or unstable.

You are forced to reboot the client by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL to continue.

This symptom occurs on a Windows or Windows for Workgroups client with ODI
support for NetWare after you log on to a NetWare domain Systems Management
Server logon server that belongs to a site that is upgraded to Systems
Management Server 1.1. The Systems Management Server therefore has upgraded
logon-server components. When you log on from the client, phase one of the
client upgrade begins by copying client components to the client. When the
copying is complete and you quit from Windows as recommended by the script
dialog box, the above symptom occurs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
