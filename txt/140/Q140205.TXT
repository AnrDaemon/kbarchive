changes in size and location of the project window.

researching this bug and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

3. On the File menu, click Save Project to save the default form and project.

4. Resize and/or move the project window to a different location on screen.

5. On the File menu, click Save Project to save the project again.

6. On the File menu, click New Project to remove the previous project from
   memory.
