DOCUMENT:Q140096  11-AUG-1999  [foxpro]
TITLE   :PRB: "Unable to start DDE communication with Program Manager"
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbvfp300

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup.exe to install a Visual FoxPro application, you may receive
this error:

   Unable to start DDE communication with Program Manager

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you are using a shell other than Program Manager for
Windows or Explorer for Windows 95. For example, Norton Desktop for Windows
version 2.0 does not handle shell dynamic data exchange (DDE). For compatibility
reasons, Progman.exe does not perform DDE unless it is the active shell in
Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this error, use Explorer.exe as the shell for Windows 95 and Program
Manager for Windows 3.1. You can load Norton Desktop for Windows as an
application.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Norton Desktop for Windows, version 2.0 is manufactured by Symantec, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.

To deactivate Norton Desktop as the shell, replace shell=ndw.exe with
shell=progman.exe in the [boot] section of the System.ini file using the
following steps:

For Windows 95:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. Type system.ini in the Open box, and click OK.

3. Replace shell=ndw.exe with shell=progman.exe in the [boot] section.

4. Save and close the file.

For windows version 3.x:

1. Use Notepad or some other text editor to open the System.ini file.

2. Replace shell=ndw.exe with shell=progman.exe in the [boot] section.

3. Save and close the file.
