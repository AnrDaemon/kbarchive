TITLE   :XFOR: How to Get the IMC to Use an Internet Provider
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 Internet Mail Connector (IMC) cannot
dial-up and send or receive mail itself. The IMC expects to be able to connect
to other SMTP hosts already available. However, there is a way to accomplish the
same thing using the AT command in Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You will need to make arrangements with the Internet Provider to hold mail
delivery until pre-defined times. At these pre- defined times, you will want to
have a batch file that is called by the AT command that initiates a RAS session
using RASDIAL, and then starts the IMC. Because the IMC can accept multiple
simultaneous connections, it can send mail and receive mail from the Internet
Provider at the same time. Lastly, you would also want to have a batch file
scheduled to stop the IMC and disconnect the RAS session.

The following are some sample batch files:

IMCSTART.BAT
------------

   rasdial <name of Internet Provider's phone book entry>
   net start msexchangeimc

IMCSTOP.BAT
-----------

   net stop msexchangeimc
   rasdial /disconnect
