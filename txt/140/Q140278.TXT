Panel, Services. You can change which account a service uses in Control Panel,
Services. Choose the service, and select Startup, Log On As and change the
account. Then if you edit the service in Microsoft Mail Service Manager, you
will receive the above error.

==========

1. Change the name of the service account in Control Panel, Services back to the
   service account that was used when you created the service.

   This is the account that shows up when you edit the service using the
   Microsoft Mail Service Manager.

2. Delete the service and recreate it.
