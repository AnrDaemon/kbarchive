The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Plus! on a Compaq Presario 140, 774, 972, 982, or
992 computer, access to the computer's floppy disk drives may be slow or
unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a conflict between the computer's floppy disk drive
controller and the visual enhancements in Microsoft Plus!.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the protected-mode floppy disk drive controller in Device Manager. To do
so, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the Floppy Disk Controller branch to
   expand it.

3. Click Standard Floppy Disk Controller, and then click Properties.

4. Click the Original Configuration (Current) check box to clear it.

5. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.

6. Restart Windows 95

If the problem persists, rename the Hsflop.pdr file to Hsflop.w95 in the
Windows\System\Iosubsys folder and restart Windows 95.

NOTE: If this resolution does not work, you must select the Windows Default theme
in Desktop Themes to regain access to the floppy disk drives.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is aware of the issue described in this article and is working with
Compaq to resolve it.
