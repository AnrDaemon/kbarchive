TITLE   :FIX: UNC File Names Cause Remote Debugging to Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.0 4.1 4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbide kbVC500fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Integrated Debugger, included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A remote debugging session hosted on Windows NT with the target located on a
computer running Windows 95 using TCP/IP may fail to acknowledge breakpoints. In
addition, pressing CTRL+BREAK interrupts the debugging session leaving you with
assembler code rather than source code in the source window.

CAUSE
=====

On the host computer, the Debug tab in the Project Settings dialog box has two
executable location fields:

 - Executable for debug session {full executable name as it appears to the host
   PC}.

 - Remote executable path and file name {full executable name as it appears to
   the remote PC}.

Using a UNC file specification for these fields results in the same entry in both
fields. For example:

   \\server\share\myproj\myprog.exe

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, map a drive to the share and use the mapped file
name. For example, from the host computer:

   p: = \\server\share

   Executable for debug session: p:\myproj\myprog.exe

   Remote executable path and file name: c:\myproj\myprog.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
