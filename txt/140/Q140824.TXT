TITLE   :RUI FI RH Bit Modified by SNA Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A node should always set the FI bit in the Request Header (RH) of a response
sent by FMI and RUI applications when the original FMD request also had the FI
bit set (even when the application explicitly cleared it).

The SNA Server node uses the RH from the original FMD request to generate the RH
of the response, setting the FI bit in the response if it was set in the
original request.


CAUSE
=====

This is contrary to the SNA Formats, which states that the FI must not be set on
FMD +responses. This fix ensures that the FI bit is cleared before a response to
an FMD request is sent.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the files, SNASERVR.EXE and TRCSERVR.EXE, to correct this
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
