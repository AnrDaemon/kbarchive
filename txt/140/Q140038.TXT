PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove an SNA Server 2.11 DEMO SDLC Link Service using SNA Server
Setup, the DEMO SDLC Link Service setup script removes the wrong link service.

After you select a DEMO SDLC Link Service in the Link Service Configuration
during SNA Server Setup and you click the Remove button, the wrong link service
is removed although the Link Services Installed listbox display is correct.

CAUSE
=====

After adding DEMO SDLC Link Services during SNA Server Setup, if the number of
link services in the Link Services Installed listbox exceeds 10 items, SNA
Server incorrectly maps the displayed link services to the underlying link
service.

RESOLUTION
==========

The DEMO SDLC Link Service setup script (SNACLASP.INF) has been modified to
remove the correct link service.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
