The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Bidirectional printer communication in Windows 95 allows programs to query the
printer directly to determine the printer's physical attributes. Bidirectional
printer communication also allows for more detailed status reporting.

To use bidirectional printer communication, the following conditions must be
met:

 - You must have a bidirectional printer.

 - You must use an IEEE 1284-compliant printer cable. Typically, such cables
   have the number 1284 printed on them.

 - You must use a correctly configured printer port. Some printer ports are set
   to AT-compatible mode by default; you must set such ports to PS/2 mode.

 - You must use a Windows 95 printer driver that supports bidirectional
   communication.
