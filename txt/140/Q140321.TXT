SUMMARY
=======

When including a combo box or list box on a form, developers often want to have
default selection as something other than the first item in the list. To do
this, set the Value property to a value contained in the list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By setting the Value property of a combo box or list box to a value contained in
the list, you ensure that the item becomes selected (highlighted) as the default
selection. All items contained in a combo box or list box are stored as a text
variables, as such any reference to a field or variable for setting the value
property must be converted to a character value. If the list contains multiple
columns the Value property must contain a value in the bound column.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Using the Customer table form the Testdata Database, create a from and add a
   list box.

2. Set the following properties for the list box:

      BoundColumn = 1
      ColumnCount = 2
      ColumnWidths = 63,150
      RowSource = Customer.Cust_id,Title
      RowSourceType = 6-Fields

3. In the Init event of the list box, add the following line of code:

      This.Value='FOLIG'

4. Save and run the form, the default (highlighted) item will be the first item
   in the list containing "FOLIG" in the first column.

This method of locating the first instance of a value in a list will only find
the first instance of a value. Items in a list are usually unique, if duplicate
values are displayed in the list, you may need to locate for a value contained
in another column either visible or not.
