PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop smsappman kbSMSAppMan

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure Office version 4.3 as a shared application and initially
install it, the Clipart Gallery is downloaded the first time you imbed a
picture. After the Clipart Gallery is downloaded, an ARTGALRY.INI file is
created on your client computer to point to the local copy. However, if you quit
Windows, restart Windows, start an Office application, and choose to embed
clipart, the Clipart Gallery is downloaded again.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
