SUMMARY
=======

When you run Creative Writer or Fine Artist for Windows, and then enter a user
name, that information is saved in the Mskids.ini file. In addition, folders are
created for the users to store their work.

To remove a person from the list of users, you must delete the folder and the
reference to the folder in the Mskids.ini file.

NOTE: Creative Writer and Fine Artist for the Macintosh do not use an Mskids.ini
file.
