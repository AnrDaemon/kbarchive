TITLE   :XADM: DirSync Imports Treated Differently by Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an import file for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks is imported into the
Directory Synchronization Stream with the -E command line option (IMPORT -E),
and the 34th character does not contain the address type, Microsoft Exchange,
acting as the Directory Server, puts these entries away and does nothing with
them nor does it register an error in Event Viewer.

On page 328 and 329 of the Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide," it states that
if the address type is omitted, it uses the PCM type by default. This was true
with Microsoft Mail acting as the Directory Synchronization Server but not with
Microsoft Exchange acting as the Directory Synchronization Server.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 required an address type to be declared.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
