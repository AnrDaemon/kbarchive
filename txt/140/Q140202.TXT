SUMMARY
=======

MFCArray is an MFC OLE Automation server application that demonstrates the use
of safe arrays. The array is passed to and returned from automation methods in a
VARIANT.

Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 was used to create the automation server. Vb.vbp and
Vb.frm in the sample are Visual Basic 5.0 files that can be used to control the
automation server.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

   MFCArray.exe
   (http://download.microsoft.com/download/ole/mfcarray/2000/WIN98/EN-US/MFCArray.exe)

MORE INFORMATION
================

MFCArray implements the following methods:

 - SlowSort: Sorts an input safearray of BSTRs and returns the sorted array and
   the time required for the sort. The array is passed by reference because it
   needs to be modified by the sort. SlowSort uses SafeArrayGetElement and
   SafeArrayPutElement to gain access to the array elements.

 - FastSort: Sorts an input safearray of BSTRs as does SlowSort but uses
   SafeArrayAccessData to get a pointer to the array elements. This allows
   direct access to the array elements instead of using SafeArrayGetElement and
   SafeArrayPutElement. This accounts for the speed improvement over SlowSort.

 - Average: Finds the average of an input safe array of integers. The array is
   not passed by reference.

 - GetArray: Creates and returns a safe array of BSTRs.
