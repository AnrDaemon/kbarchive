The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows NT Multitasking MTA (NT MMTA) can be stopped and started
from the command prompt. You can put the commands in a command (.CMD) file for
convenience.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the NT MMTA can be configured as a Windows NT Service, it can also be
stopped and started from the command line. The following examples will explain
how to stop and start the NT MMTA services.

Steps to Start
--------------

1. Create a service with the Microsoft Mail Service Manager.

2. Open the Control Panel, and select Services. Look up the name of the instance
   to be started. For example, the name of the service can be "MS Mail External
   - (instance1)."

3. Open a command prompt window.

4. Type the following command at the command prompt:

   " Net Start "MS Mail External - (instance1)" " (without the quotation marks)

5. Open the Control Panel, and select Services. Verify that the service is
   started.

6. Open Microsoft Mail Service Manager and monitor the service to see that it is
   working properly.

Steps to Stop
-------------

1. Open the Control Panel, and select Services. Look up the name of the instance
   that will be stopped. For example, the name of the service is "MS Mail
   External - (instance1)."

2. Open a command prompt window.

3. Type the following command at the command prompt:

   " Net Stop "MS Mail External - (instance1)" " (without the quotation marks)

4. Open the Control Panel, and select Services. Verify that the service is
   stopped.

If you have multiple services to be stopped and started, a command file could be
created with the above commands. This makes it convenient to stop and start
multiple services. Both the Mail External and Dispatch programs work with this
method. The following command files are examples that could be used to start and
stop multiple services:

   START.CMD

   net start "ms mail dispatch - (instance1)"
   net start "ms mail external - (instance2)"
   net start "ms mail external - (instance3)"

   STOP.CMD

   net stop "ms mail dispatch - (instance1)"
   net stop "ms mail external - (instance2)"
   net stop "ms mail external - (instance3)"
