TITLE   :FindFirstFile Returns Error: The Network Name Was Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbProgramming

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you programmatically add a share (NetShareAdd) and immediately run
FindFirstFile on the directory just shared, the following error is displayed:

   The network name was deleted.

This only happens if the share is created on the local computer.

CAUSE
=====

"Invalid UID or TID" is returned internally because there is no
SrvSmbSessionSetupAndX and SrvSmbTreeConnectAndX Server Message Block (SMB) yet.

RESOLUTION
==========

After NetShareAdd, call FindFirstFile more than once. Only the first call
returns the error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the correct SHARE_INFO_502 structure, the following code would cause this
error:

   ret = NetShareAdd(TEXT("\\\\SERVER"),502, (LPBYTE)&si_502,NULL);

      if ( ret != 0)
      {
         wprintf(TEXT("NetShareAdd() error!"));
         return;
      }

      if((fh=FindFirstFile(TEXT("\\\\SERVER\\TEST\\*"),&wfd))==
      INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE){
         ErrorHandler(TEXT("FindFirstFile() failed!"));}
