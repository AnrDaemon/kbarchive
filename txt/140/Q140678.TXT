SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how Windows 95 manages the size of the disk cache, and
how you can change it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows 95, the disk cache changes size dynamically in response to the
current needs of the system. Windows 95 manages the size of the disk cache by
computing the following values once each second:

 - How fast the computer is running.

 - How fast the computer would be running if the disk cache were larger.

 - How fast the computer would be running if the disk cache were smaller.

Windows 95 adjusts the size of the disk cache as needed to maintain the fastest
computer speed. Windows 95 can adjust the size of the disk cache up to the
maximum size established at system startup, or down to the minimum size
established at system startup.

For information about changing the maximum and minimum cache sizes in Windows 95,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
