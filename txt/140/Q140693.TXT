SYMPTOMS

When you use DBSETPROP() to change the data type of a field in a remote view,
you receive the following error after issuing the REQUERY() command:

   Error: View definition has been changed.

CAUSE

Visual FoxPro 3.0 tests the local data dictionary of the old view and the
requeried view and finds a change in the data contained in the column.

STATUS
======

the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

1. Create and save a remote view of a table that contains a datetime field.

2. In the Command window, type the following line of code, substituting the
   appropriate names where indicated by the brackets (<>):

      ? DBSETPROP( <'RemoteViewName.FieldName'>, 'Field', 'DataType', 'D' )

3. Close the remote view and re-open it. Then run the view again and confirm
