SUMMARY
=======

There are six types of reusable libraries: Static Single Threaded Library
(Debug/Release), Static Multithreaded Library (Debug/Release), and Dynamic Link
Library (DLL)(Debug/Release). The DLL is multithread-afe and a single- thread
version of the CRT library is not provided for DLLs. If the reusable library or
any user of the library is using multiple threads, then the library needs to be
a multithread-safe library type.

NOTE: Debug libraries and compiler switches /MLd, /MTd, and /MDd are only
available in Visual C++ versions 4.0 and above.

The following table shows which compiler switch should be used for building each
of the six types of reusable libraries (all DLL types are multithread- safe).
Any project using the reusable library should use the same compiler switch. When
using the /ML(default), /MLd, /MT, /MTd, /MD, or /MDd compiler switches, the
compiler places the default library name (listed under the Library column) in
the object file.

Reusable Library            Switch    Library    Macro(s) Defined
----------------------------------------------------------------
Single Threaded             /ML       LIBC       (none)
Static MultiThread          /MT       LIBCMT     _MT
Dynamic Link (DLL)          /MD       MSVCRT     _MT and _DLL
Debug Single Threaded       /MLd      LIBCD      _DEBUG
Debug Static MultiThread    /MTd      LIBCMTD    _DEBUG and _MT
Debug Dynamic Link (DLL)    /MDd      MSVCRTD    _DEBUG, _MT, and _DLL

You can view an object module to determine which switch was used when it was
built by using this command:

      dumpbin /all <object>.obj

Look in the section titled RAW DATA #1. In the right-most column, the default
libraries will be listed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A reusable library and all of its users should use the same CRT library types
and therefore the same compiler switch. The macros defined (or not defined) for
each of the compiler switches can be used in the header file(s) of your reusable
library to enforce the proper compiler switch. The sample code in this article
demonstrates how to use these macros.

If you would like users of the library to be able to choose static or DLL CRT,
you should provide both static and DLL reusable library types.

If you do choose to mix CRT libraries, remember that you have two separate copies
of the CRT, with separate and distinct states, so you must be careful about what
you try to do across a CRT-boundary. There are many ways to get into trouble
with two CRTs. Here are just a few:

 - There are two separate heaps. You cannot allocate (explicitly with new,
   malloc, or so on -- or implicitly with strdup, strstreambuf::str, or so on),
   and then pass the pointer across a CRT-boundary to be freed.

 - You cannot pass a FILE* or file handle across a CRT-boundary and expect the
   studio low level io to work.

 - You cannot set the locale in one and expect the other's locale to be set.

Beginning with Visual C++ 4.0, the linker will issue a warning (LNK4098) if a
resulting module attempts to combine more than one copy of the CRT library. For
more information, search the Help file for LNK4098.

Sample Code
-----------

The following code can be used in the reusable library's header file to ensure
the consistent use of the correct compiler switch:

   // MyReusableStaticSingleThreadReleaseLibrary.h
   #if defined(_MT) || defined(_DEBUG)
       #error The /ML compiler switch is required.
   #endif

   // MyReusableStaticMultithreadReleaseLibrary.h
   #if !defined(_MT) || defined(_DLL) || defined(_DEBUG)
       #error The /MT compiler switch is required.
   #endif

   // MyReusableDynamicLinkReleaseLibrary.h
   #if !defined(_MT) || !defined(_DLL) || defined(_DEBUG)
       #error The /MD compiler switch is required.
   #endif

   // MyReusableStaticSingleThreadDebugLibrary.h
   #if defined(_MT) || !defined(_DEBUG)
       #error The /MLd compiler switch is required.
   #endif

   // MyReusableStaticMultithreadDebugLibrary.h
   #if !defined(_MT) || defined(_DLL) || !defined(_DEBUG)
       #error The /MTd compiler switch is required.
   #endif

   // MyReusableDynamicLinkDebugLibrary.h
   #if !defined(_MT) || !defined(_DLL) || !defined(_DEBUG)
       #error The /MDd compiler switch is required.
   #endif
