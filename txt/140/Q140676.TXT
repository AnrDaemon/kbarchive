======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use ClassWizard to add a handler for the WM_HELP message, the message
is not listed in the Messages list box. Instead, the message is listed as
WM_HELPINFO.

RESOLUTION
==========

Select WM_HELPINFO to add a handler for WM_HELP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Previous versions of MFC define OnHelp as the function to handle the WM_COMMAND
message with ID_HELP. To avoid conflicts with this message handler, MFC 4.x and
higher use OnHelpInfo as the name of the function that handles the WM_HELP
message. So ClassWizard shows the WM_HELP message as WM_HELPINFO.
