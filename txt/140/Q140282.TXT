======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Oceans for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Dogs for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft World of Flight for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In any of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, when you select
a Screen Saver, this action changes the Screen Saver settings for Windows.
Therefore, if you select (none) as the screen saver option, you will no longer
have a screen saver selected in Windows.

CAUSE
=====

Because Windows can use only one screen saver at a time, if you change the
screen saver option in the multimedia programs listed above, you change the
settings for the entire system.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are in the process of changing your screen saver settings, but decide you
don't want to change the screen saver setting for your entire system, click
Cancel in the Screen Saver dialog box of the multimedia program you are using.

If you have already changed your screen saver to (none) or to a screen saver you
don't want to keep, you can change it back to a previous screen saver. To do
this, use the following steps:

If you are using Windows 95
---------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Screen Saver tab.

4. Select the desired screen saver and click OK.

If you are using Windows 3.x
----------------------------

1. Open Control Panel (usually found in the Main group of Program Manager).

2. Double-click Desktop.

3. In the Screen Saver area, select the desired screen saver and click OK.

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.
