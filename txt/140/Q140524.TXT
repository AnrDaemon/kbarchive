TITLE   :SNA Server Event ID 18 Reports Incorrect Sense Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Sense Data that is logged as part of the Event ID 18 description in the
Windows NT application log is not logged accurately.

This symptom occurs when SNA Server receives a BIND Negative Response or an
UNBIND Request for an APPC session and logs Event ID 18 in the Windows NT
application log.

However, SNA Server traces do show the correct Sense Data for the error that is
causing Event ID 18 to be logged.

Note: Chapter 9 of the IBM SNA Formats Guide (GA27-3136) details IBM Sense Codes.

CAUSE
=====

Event ID 18 is logging incorrect Sense Data because of the following two
problems:

 - The secondary sense data (bytes 2 & 3) are being logged to a random
   value.

 - If either the primary or secondary sense data have a value of 8000 or
   greater, it is logged as FFFF8xxx.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNASERVR.EXE
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\TRCSERVR.EXE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
