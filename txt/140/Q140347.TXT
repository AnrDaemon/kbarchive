The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows 95 user interface requires that stacked pages in a page frame be
aligned vertically. However, Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups, present
stacked pages using a step effect. This article provides a way to take this
difference into account when developing a form to be run on multiple platforms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the PageFrame control to build a form in Visual FoxPro 3.0, Visual
FoxPro automatically calculates the left position of the page. You cannot modify
it under program control.

In Windows 95 and Windows NT, pages are stacked as follows:

           -----------------------------
           | Page 4  | Page 5 | Page 6 |
           -----------------------------
           | Page 1  | Page 2 | Page 3 |
           -----------------------------

In Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups, pages are stacked as follows:

              ------------------------------
              | Page 4  | Page 5  | Page 6 |
           ---------------------------------
           | Page 1   | Page 2  | Page 3 |
           -------------------------------

Each new row is placed 12 pixels to the right of the preceding row.

If you develop a form under Windows 95 and run it under Windows 3.1, Visual
FoxPro accommodates the stepping effect by maintaining the same width for the
page frame and recalculating the width of each page. The width of each page is
therefore smaller. Under these conditions, if a control is placed on the right
edge of a page, it might be truncated when the page is displayed on a different
platform.

If a page frame with stacked pages is to be run under different platforms, place
controls away from the edges of a page to prevent them from being truncated, or
modify the width of the page frame when the form is run in Windows 3.1. For
example, if the page frame has three rows, use the following code in the Init
event of the PageFrame.

      IF VAL(SUBSTR(OS(1),9,4)) < 4.00  && Verify the Operating System
         THIS.WIDTH = THIS.WIDTH + (12.0 * 3)
      ENDIF

In this code, 12.0 is a constant and 3 represents the number of rows of tabs.
