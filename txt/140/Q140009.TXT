TITLE   :Microsoft Exchange Printout Is Titled "Unknown"

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print an e-mail message from Microsoft Exchange, the printout may be
titled "Unknown."

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the following situations exists:

 - The Microsoft Network Online Service is the only service in the current
   profile.

 - You have no service provider selected, and the current profile contains only
   a personal address book (.pab file) and a personal information store (.pst
   file).

   NOTE: In both cases above, you are not prompted for user information when the
   profile is created, so the registry entry for the profile does not contain
   the user data required for the printout title.

 - You have The Microsoft Network Online Service installed in the current
   profile along with other message services.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

If the Microsoft Network Online Service is the only service in your profile, add
another service to the profile. For example, add the Microsoft Fax service. This
service requires a user name, which is printed as the message title.

To use the Microsoft Fax service, you must first add the Microsoft Fax component
in Windows 95, which adds the Microsoft Fax service to Microsoft Exchange as an
option.

To add the Microsoft Fax component in Windows 95, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab.

3. In the Components box, click the Microsoft Fax check box to select it, and
   then click OK.

To add the Microsoft Fax service to your profile, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Exchange, click Services on the Tools menu.

2. Click Add.

3. Click Microsoft Fax, and then click OK.

4. Supply the information required by Microsoft Exchange when you are prompted.

5. Click OK.

Method 2
--------

If no service provider is included in your profile, add one (other than the
Microsoft Network Online Service).

Method 3
--------

Remove The Microsoft Network Online Service from the profile, then add it back
again.

STATUS
======
