The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to make the Wizard TxtBtns class from the
WizStyle.vcx library work on a form that also holds a PageFrame. By default,
TxtBtn and PageFrame classes do not function properly together. This article
shows you how to overcome this limitation.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form by using the Form Wizard or by creating a form of your own.
   Add the TxtBtns. For more information, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Be sure to set the form's Buffermode property to 1 or 2 and set the Enabled
   property of each control on the form to False (.F.).

2. Add a PageFrame to the form, and add some text boxes to the pages.

3. Set the Enabled property for each text box in the PageFrame to False (.F.).

4. In the Click event of the cmdAdd button, add this code:

         * Note: Repeat the second line for each page in the PageFrame
         * substituting the appropriate name for each page
         txtbtns.cmdAdd::click()
         thisform.pageframe1.page1.setall("enabled",this.parent.editmode)
         thisform.pageframe1.setall("enabled",.t.,"label")

5. In the Click event of the cmdEdit button, add this code:

         * Note: Repeat the second line for each page in the PageFrame
         * substituting the appropriate name for each page
         txtbtns.cmdEdit::click()
         thisform.pageframe1.page1.setall("enabled",this.parent.editmode)
         thisform.pageframe1.setall("enabled",.t.,"label")

6. Save and run the form.
