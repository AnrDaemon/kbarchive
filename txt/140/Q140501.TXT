TITLE   :No Sounds When Playing 3D Pinball
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play 3D Pinball you may not hear any sounds, although sounds are played
correctly in other programs.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the WaveOutDevice setting specified in the
Wavemix.inf file for 3D Pinball does not correspond to the preferred playback
device in the Multimedia audio settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the Wavemix.inf file in the Program Files\Plus!\Pinball folder and change
the WaveOutDevice setting to correspond to the preferred playback device in the
Multimedia audio settings. To determine the preferred playback device,
double-click the Multimedia icon in Control Panel, and check the Preferred
Device box on the Audio tab.

Using any text editor, open the Wavemix.inf file in the Program Files\
Plus!\Pinball folder. In the [General] section of the file, locate the following
line:

   WaveOutDevice=0

Change this line to read:

   WaveOutDevice=1

Save the Wavemix.inf file and then restart the computer.

Notes
-----

 - Be sure to edit the Wavemix.inf file in the Pinball folder. Do not edit any
   other Wavemix.inf file.

 - If you are using a Creative Labs Phone Blaster, or possibly other
   multiple-function devices, it may be necessary to change the WaveOutDevice
   setting to 2 instead of 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Plus! version 1.0 for
Windows 95. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
