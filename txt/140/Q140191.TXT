TITLE   :PC WSPlus: SCHDIST.EXE Ignores CAL File Security
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set an user's access to your calendar file (CAL) to be None, he or she
will not be able to see your free/busy times. However, if you set an external
postoffice user's access to None, he or she will still be able to see your
free/busy information.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the free/busy information is distributed by SCHDIST.EXE in
the form of .POF files. The .POF files do not have support for the individual
security settings that can be applied to .CAL files created by Schedule+.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
