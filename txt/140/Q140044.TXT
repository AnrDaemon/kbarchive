TITLE   :Visual Basic Menus Disappear Using Shell Technology Preview
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On your Windows NT computer running the Shell Technology Preview for Windows NT
3.51, toolbars, tooltips, and/or menus display incorrectly or not at all in
applications created in Visual Basic.

CAUSE
=====

The Shell Technology Preview has not been fully tested and should not be
deployed in production environments. There is currently no official Microsoft
Product Support Services support available for using the Shell Technology
Preview on Windows NT version 3.51. If you wish to join other customers who are
using and exchanging feedback on the Shell Technology Preview, Section 15 of the
MSDR forum on CompuServe has been created for this type of member-to-member
communication.

If you wish to report a problem, please do so through our CompuServe or Internet
services as follows. These are not support locations, but may be used to submit
problems you encounter, using PROBREP.TXT (the problem report template included
with the NewShell files).

CompuServe: Upload PROBREP.TXT to the WINNT forum, Library 3.

FTP: Connect to ftp.microsoft.com

   ftp>cd e: ftp>cd incoming/bussys/winnt/probrep ftp>bin ftp>put
   probrep.txt

Internet mail: send to ntbug@microsoft.com

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct these problems it is necessary to remove the New Shell by running
SHUPDATE.CMD /U. This command will remove the Shell Technology Preview Update
and reinstall Program Manager from the previous Windows NT 3.51 configuration.

STATUS
======

These problems will be corrected in the next released version of Windows NT
incorporating the new Shell Technology.
