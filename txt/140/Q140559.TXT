The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you open and then save a PowerPoint presentation in Windows that was
originally created on a Macintosh, you may notice that the file size increases
significantly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you save a file in PowerPoint for the Macintosh and that file contains
graphic images, the graphics are stored as native Macintosh graphic (QuickDraw)
commands.

When you open the same file in PowerPoint for Windows, the file's size increases
because the graphic images contained in the presentation are converted into
Windows GDI (Graphics Device Interface) commands. If the graphics are
bitmap-based, the GDI commands may require more disk space than the equivalent
QuickDraw commands.

Likewise, if you open and save a file in PowerPoint for the Macintosh that was
created in PowerPoint for Windows, the file size decreases.

The difference in file size may vary, depending on the number of graphics
inserted into the presentation, the graphical resolution, and the number of
colors.
