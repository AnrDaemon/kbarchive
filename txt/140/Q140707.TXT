======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the DIR command on a NetWare volume, files with no extension may
not be listed.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known limitation with Command.com when you are using NetWare servers
with OS/2 Name Space (long file name) support installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you use the DIR command to list a file with no extension, use a period (.)
at the end of the file name. For example, to list a file named Test, type the
following command:

   dir test.

You could also type

   dir *.*

or

   dir

to list the Test file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
