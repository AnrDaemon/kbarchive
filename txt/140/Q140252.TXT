-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The ClassWizard, included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 4.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If either the header (.h) or implementation (.cpp) file for a class is a
read-only file, the following buttons will be grayed out in ClassWizard:

 - Add Function button on the Message Map tab.

 - Add Variable button on Member Variables tab.

 - Add Method and Add Property buttons on the OLE Automation tab.

 - Add Event button on the OLE Event tab.

In Visual C++, versions 5.0 and 6.0, the OLE Automation tab is named Automation,
and OLE Event is now ActiveX Events. Also, the following additional buttons will
be dimmed:

 - Delete Function button on the Message Map tab.

 - Delete Variable button on Member Variables tab.

Having a project's .odl file tagged as read-only causes the same behavior, and
having the .clw file tagged as read-only produces this message:

   The ClassWizard database <path to the .clw file> is read-only.
   ClassWizard cannot continue.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. ClassWizard checks the attributes of the header and
implementation files for a class when a class is selected from the Class Name
combo box. If either file is read-only, ClassWizard can't add a new method,
function, or variable to the file, so the buttons are disabled.

If the files are checked-in to a source management system such as Microsoft
SourceSafe, they are read-only until they are checked out.

RESOLUTION
==========

A simple workaround is to remove the read-only attribute from those files. If
the files are under source management, checking the file out removes the
read-only attribute as well.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
