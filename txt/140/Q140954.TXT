TITLE   :XCLN: Win16 Silent Mode Setup Fails to Create Profile
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you modify the Setup.stf and Default.prf files of the Microsoft Exchange
client for Windows 3.x network installation share point using the Microsoft
Exchange Setup Editor, subsequent attempts to perform workstation installs in
silent mode, setup /q, fail to create a default profile but complete without any
errors.

CAUSE
=====

The silent mode setup, setup /q, fails to copy Default.prf into the
<drive>:\<windir> subdirectory during the file copy phase. The
absence of this file prevents Newprof.exe from creating a default profile.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Windows
3.x client version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server
4.0 U.S. Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
