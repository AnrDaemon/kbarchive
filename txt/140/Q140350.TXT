TITLE   :Deleting .frx File Causes Visual Basic to Exit Abnormally
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you delete the .frx file of a form containing a ListView control that has at
least two column headers, you will encounter the following error when attempting
to reload the project in the Visual Basic design environment.

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic stores binary information vital to the functionality of the form
and its child controls in the .frx files.

The .frx files should never be deleted or modified manually.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0 (32-bit) or on the File menu, click New Project (ALT,
   N, P) if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a ListView control to Form1.

3. Right click the ListView control, click the Column Headers tab. Insert at
   least two column headers. Click OK to exit the dialog box.

4. Save the project.

5. In the File Manager or the Explorer delete the .frx file for Form1.

6. Reopen the project in Visual Basic 4.0 (32-bit).

7. Open Form1, by double-clicking it in the Project window. You will receive the
   following warning:

   Errors during load. Refer to '<form path>\<form file>.log' for
   details.

8. Close Form1. As a result, an application error occurs and Visual Basic
   terminates.

RESOLUTION
==========

The .frx files should never be deleted or modified manually. Deleting or
modifying the .frx file results in Visual Basic acting unpredictably when
accessing the associated form.
