TITLE   :SMS Windows NT Client Terminates Due to Heap Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Windows NT client (CLI_NT.EXE) terminates due to a
heap error. This occurs only when there is no "Load" value in the client
computer's registry. That is, in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, if the key
value:

   Software/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/Windows/Load

exists, but is blank, the problem does not show up. However, if the value,
"Load," does not exist, the heap error occurs.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has modified the files, CLI_NT.EXE, CLI_DOS.EXE, and CLI_OS2.EXE, to
correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
