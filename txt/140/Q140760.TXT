TITLE   :PRB: Invalid Key Length Error When Indexing a Cursor File
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp300 kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Indexing a cursor file with a key field that contains more than 240 characters
generates this error:

   Invalid Key Length

This procedure did not generate an error in FoxPro version 2.6.

CAUSE
=====

This is a deliberate change in behavior. The maximum length for an index key in
a compact index is 240 bytes. If a key is longer than 240, FoxPro 2.6 truncates
it. Visual FoxPro 3.0, 5.0 and 6.0 display the "Invalid Key Length" error
message to protect against the possiblity of generating duplicates.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error message also occurs with a table.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Type the following commands in the Command window:

      CREATE CURSOR Address (address C(254))
      INDEX ON address TAG address

The "Invalid Key Length" error message is displayed.
