SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Backup to format a QIC-80 2120XL (extended length) tape
on a Connor Tape Stor 250 tape drive that is controlled by the floppy disk drive
controller, you may receive the following error message:

   Errors occurred during this operation. Do you want to view them now?

The error log reports the following information:

   Error/Warnings during operation:
   1173(11056,2) - \\ Unknown error.
   1320(13408,3) - \\ Warning: This operation has been canceled by the system.

   Total number of errors encountered: 2

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if you try to format a 2120XL tape on an older Connor Tape
Stor 250 tape drive. Older drives can be identified by the presence of an eject
button.

RESOLUTION
==========

Connor currently has no solution for this problem. Connor advises customers to
purchase preformatted XL tapes for these older drives. Connor's newer drives
(without the eject button) do not experience this problem.
