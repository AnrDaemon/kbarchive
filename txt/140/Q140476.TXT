TITLE   :How to Install a BDC in a Routed TCP/IP Environment

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When an installation of a backup domain controller (BDC) is performed, the
primary domain controller (PDC) must be available to establish the computer
account and the Security Identifier (SID) for the new BDC. If the protocol being
used is TCP/IP and, in order to form a connection to the PDC, TCP/IP must be
routed, name resolution for the domain name and the computer name must be
established during the Network setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Name resolution for connectivity to the primary domain controller can be
established by using one of the following methods:

 - Enter a primary and, optionally, a secondary WINS server where the PDC has
   registered the domain<1Bh> entry.

   -or-

 - Use an LMHOSTS file that has at least an entry for the PDC as follows:

   

   <;PDC IP address>;  "DOMAINNAME   \0x1B"  #PRE

   NOTE: There must be exactly 20 characters inside the double quotes.

   Q180099 Troubleshooting LMHOSTS Name Resolution Issues

During installation, if WINS servers are not available, the LMHOSTS file can be
used by importing it from a floppy disk or from an existing physical drive on
the computer being installed. The location for importing the LMHOSTS file is in
the Advanced options in the TCP/IP configuration dialog during Network setup.
This must be completed during the portion of Setup where you configure the
properties of the TCP/IP protocol.

If the PDC cannot be located during setup, you will get the following error
message:

   The domain controller for this domain cannot be located.

If you get this message, check the following:

 - Adapter configuration settings.

 - Default gateway configuration on the adapter.

 - If using WINS to locate the PDC, make sure the WINS server you are pointing
   to contains the 1Bh registration for the domain name.

 - Check the syntax of the LMHOSTS file.

At this point, installation must be restarted. Going back to the network
configuration by selecting the previous screen boxes will not reinitialize your
TCP/IP configuration settings.

NOTE: If you are installing a Windows NT 4.0 domain controller, restarting the
server will restart the installation at the GUI portion of setup. Previous
versions of Windows NT require setup to be restarted from the beginning.

This scenario is not an issue for a server non-domain controller, as that type of
installation is capable of becoming part of a workgroup where membership in the
domain is not mandatory during setup.
