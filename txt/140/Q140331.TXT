TITLE   :FAX: Send Fax Macro No Longer Works with 32-bit Office products
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:3.0a; Win95:; :
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0a 
 - Microsoft Office for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Office 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Send Fax macro that is located under the File menu of Microsoft Word for
Windows version 7.0 and Microsoft Excel for Windows version 7.0 are no longer
operable when you use version 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, or 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows.

If you choose the Send Fax option when you run the Windows mail client, the error
messages below will be displayed:

Microsoft Word for Windows:

   Microsoft Word Err=1046
   Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup.

   -OR-

   MAPI of Microsoft Mail for Windows is not installed. You cannot send fax but
   you can print fax images to file.

Microsoft Excel for Windows:

   Macro error
   [MSFAX.XLA] Msfax! B32

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Microsoft Exchange Mail client instead of the Windows Mail client for
the Send Fax macro to work as expected with Microsoft Gateway to FAX.

For proper execution of the macro, it is important that the Microsoft Fax driver
be set to the GENI: (Unknown local port) in the Microsoft Windows 95 printer
properties section.

-OR-

Configure the Microsoft Fax driver so that it prints to FILE. Select the print
option in any Windows application and give the file a compatible DCX file name,
such as <myfile>.DCX. Next, attach the *.DCX file to a Microsoft Mail
message in either the Windows or Microsoft Exchange Mail client.

NOTE: For attachments to be properly handled by the fax gateway, it is necessary
that the MSFAX.DRV file that ships with the Gateway to Microsoft FAX be used in
lieu of the MSFAX.DRV that ships with Windows 95.
