SUMMARY
=======

When you use Network Monitor to determine Node type, you may come to an invalid
conclusion, if the assumption is made that any P-NODE client will not issue a
broadcast for NetBIOS name resolution. This also applies to H- NODE detection in
some cases.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an excerpt from a White Paper on TCP/IP implementation,
TCPIPIMP.DOC, available for download from CIS or the Microsoft FTP server.


NodeType
Key: Netbt\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
Valid Range: 1,2,4,8 (b-node, p-node, m-node, h-node)
Default: 1 or 8 based on the WINS server configuration

Description: This parameter determines what methods NetBT will use to
register and resolve names. A b-node system uses broadcasts. A p-node
system uses only point-to-point name queries to a name server (WINS). An m-
node system broadcasts first, then queries the name server. An h-node
system queries the name server first, then broadcasts. Resolution via
LMHOSTS and/or DNS, if enabled, will follow these methods. If this key is
present it will override the DhcpNodeType key. If neither key is present,
the system defaults to b-node if there are no WINS servers configured for
the client. The system defaults to h-node if there is at least one WINS
server configured.

The described behavior of the p-node client is correct unless the internet
group name associated with type 1C is returned from the WINS server or if a
LMHOSTS file has a 0 (zero) entry for broadcast. In these cases a single
broadcast will be observed from the client. This does not effect network
operation and causes no problems. A single broadcast from a client will not
adversely affect network operations.

This is expected behavior as an internet address of all zeros is used to
address the network as a whole.
