SYMPTOMS
========

After installing InstallSHIELD SDK Edition from Microsoft Visual C++ version

application:

   Setup requires a different version of Windows. Check to
   make sure that you are running Setup on the Windows platform
   for which it is intended.

=====

The message occurs when a the _inst32i.ex_ does not exist in the directory where
Setup.exe is located.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem in both the Template application and in projects created
with InstallSHIELD SDK Edition, copy the _inst32i.ex_ from the \Ishield\Disk1
directory on the Visual C++ compact disc into the following two locations on the
hard drive:

   \Program Files\Stirling\InstallShield\Program

   -and-

   \Program Files\Stirling\InstallShield\Template\One\Disk1

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.

This problem occurs only when InstallSHIELD is installed from Microsoft Visual
C++ version 4.0. It does not occur when InstallSHIELD is installed from the
Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit.
