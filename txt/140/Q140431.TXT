======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to recompress a disk with Compression Agent, you may receive one of
the following error messages:

   - Compression Agent cannot recompress this drive because it contains errors
   that must first be repaired. Click Help, carry out the instructions for
   repairing the errors, and then try again.

   - Compression Agent could not finish recompressing the drive because there
   was an error. ID No: CMPAGENT103

The same error message may occur again even if you run ScanDisk and correct the
errors on the disk before running Compression Agent again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the compressed drive contains unreliable clusters
that ScanDisk cannot detect.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure ScanDisk to detect disk timeouts while performing a surface scan, and
then run ScanDisk from a command prompt. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, click Shut Down, click the "Restart the computer in
   MS-DOS mode" option, and then click Yes.

2. Type the following line, and then press ENTER:

   edit c:\windows\command\scandisk.ini

3. Add the following line to the [Environment] section of the file:

   ScanTimeOut=On

4. Save the Scandisk.ini file, and then exit the editor.

5. Type the following line and then press ENTER to run ScanDisk:

   scandisk

   Run a surface scan when ScanDisk prompts you to do so.

6. Repair any errors that ScanDisk finds.

7. When ScanDisk is finished, type "exit" (without the quotation marks) and then
   press ENTER.

8. Run Compression Agent again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "ScanTimeOut=On" entry causes ScanDisk to detect disk timeouts while
performing a surface scan. This allows ScanDisk to detect marginal clusters that
are not reliable enough to store data. These clusters are detected by
Compression Agent when you attempt to recompress your files, but they are not
normally detected by ScanDisk.
