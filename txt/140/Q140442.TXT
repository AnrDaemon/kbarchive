SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access a Windows 95-based computer acting as an NCP server
(NWSERVER) from an MS-DOS session using the Microsoft NCP Client (NWREDIR), you
may receive the following error message on a blue screen:

   Client Service for NetWare

   Select Retry to try the operation again, or press Escape to cancel all
   outstanding background operations on this connection.

   Operation: File Write
   Error: 0x33 'No Response'

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if the NCP server was shut down after a connection or drive
mapping was made and data was transferred between the two computers. Any
additional data transfers to the unavailable server result in the error message.

Verify that the Windows 95 NCP server you are trying to connect to is running
and that the File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks service is loaded.

To determine whether the File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks service is
loaded, follow these steps at the server:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

2. Check the "The following network components are installed" box to see if the
   File and Printer Sharing services is loaded.

If the File and Printer Sharing service is not loaded, follow these steps to load
it:

1. Click Add, click Services, and then click Add.

2. In the Manufacturers box, click Microsoft. In the Network Services box, click
   File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks.

3. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.

4. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
