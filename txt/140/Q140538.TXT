SUMMARY
=======

By design, a Print dialog box is displayed in MFC printing. This dialog box
allows the user to change the printer settings before a printer device context
(DC) is created. However, there are cases when the print dialog box is not a
good idea. This article provides a way to bypass the Print dialog box for a
print job.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CView::OnPreparePrinting is the first virtual function called during the print
process. It is also called during print preview. AppWizard provides an
implementation of OnPreparePrinting that calls CView::DoPreparePrinting.
DoPreparePrinting displays the print dialog box for actual printing but not for
print preview.

Therefore, in OnPreparePrinting, if CPrintInfo::m_bPreview is FALSE (an actual
print job), set it to TRUE before calling DoPreparePrinting(). This makes
DoPreparePrinting believe that the current context is that of print preview so
the print dialog box isn't shown. After DoPreparePrinting returns, reset the
variable to FALSE to let the print job go on uninterrupted.

The following sample code prevents the Print dialog box from appearing without
affecting the print process.

Sample Code
-----------

   BOOL CMyView::OnPreparePrinting(CPrintInfo* pInfo)
   {
         if ( pInfo->m_bPreview )        // normal print preview
               return DoPreparePrinting(pInfo);

   // actual printing
         pInfo->m_bPreview = TRUE;
         BOOL bRetval = DoPreparePrinting( pInfo );
         pInfo->m_bPreview = FALSE;
         return bRetval;
   }
