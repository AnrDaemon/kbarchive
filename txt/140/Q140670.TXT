TITLE   :FIX: Using Run-Time Type Info May Cause Memory Leak Report
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.00 4.10
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCRT kbVC

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When exiting a debug application that uses run-time type information (RTTI) and
calls the 'name' member function of the type_info class, Visual C++ reports
"Detected memory leaks!" in the output window.

CAUSE
=====

When you call the 'name' member function of the type_info class, it incorrectly
allocates a _NORMAL_BLOCK buffer to hold the type name. This can cause a memory
leak to be reported incorrectly when you run a debug version of the program.

RESOLUTION
==========

The reported memory leak can be ignored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++, 32-bit
Edition, version 4.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you call the 'name' member function of the type_info and then later call
_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks, memory leaks are incorrectly reported. The following sample
code demonstrates the problem.

Sample Code
-----------

   /* Compile options needed: /D_DEBUG
   */ 

   #include <typeinfo.h>
   #include <iostream.h>
   #include <crtdbg.h>

   struct test {};

   void main()
   {
       test t;
       typeid(t).name();
       _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks();
   }

You would see messages similar to the following in the debug tab of the output
window:

   

   Loaded symbols for 'E:\WINNT35\system32\MSVCR40D.DLL'
   Detected memory leaks!
   Dumping objects ->
   {44} normal block at 0x002D2390, 12 bytes long.
   Data: <struct test > 73 74 72 75 63 74 20 74 65 73 74 00
   Object dump complete.
   The program 'E:\temp\Text1.exe' has exited with code 1 (0x1).

NOTE: If you are using the 'name' member function within an MFC application, the
leaks will be reported even if you do not explicitly call _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks.
MFC calls this function automatically when the application terminates.
