SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to create a shortcut in Windows 95 to modify a form or
project in Visual FoxPro instead of running it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, under Windows 95, Visual FoxPro only supports the actions of the OPEN
command, which attempts to run the selected program or project. However, you can
create a shortcut to a program that executes the functionality you want.

For Example, to have a shortcut to a Project that you want Visual FoxPro to
modify when you double-click it, create a program that contains this line of
code:

      MODIFY PROJECT HOME()+'\samples\mainsamp\tastrade.pjx' NOWAIT

Save the program as Shortcut2tastrade. Create a shortcut to this program, and
then drop the shortcut on your Desktop. Then you can double-click the shortcut
to open or modify the project instead of running the main program.

NOTE: It is important that you use the NOWAIT clause. Otherwise, you'd have to
press the ESC key to cancel the program.

This same method can be used with forms. It will also work with other FoxPro
versions; Visual FoxPro is not required.
