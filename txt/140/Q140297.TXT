======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Visual FoxPro Language Reference and in the Help file under
CURSORSETPROP(), the SendUpdates property is described as follows:

SendUpdates   .T. - Specifies that a SQL update query is sent to update
              remote tables.
              .F. - Specifies that a SQL update query is not sent to update
              remote tables.

In the Visual FoxPro Language Reference and in the Help file under
CURSORGETPROP(), the SendUpdates property is described as follows:

SendUpdates     L      Contains true (.T.) if a SQL update query is sent
                       to update remote tables; otherwise, contains false
                       (.F.) (the default).
                       Read-Write.

Although these imply that this property is only valid for cursors from remote
views, this property also applies to cursors that are created from local views.

This documentation error has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A cursor created from a view must have its SendUpdates property set to true
(.T.) if changes to the view are to update the source table. This is the case
regardless of whether the view is from a native FoxPro table (a local view) or
from a non-FoxPro table such as a Microsoft Access or SQL Server database (a
remote view).
