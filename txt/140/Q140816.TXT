TITLE   :EHNAPPC Data Stream Header Data Being Passed to TP
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using mapped APPC conversations with the Enhanced Router API (EHNAPPC.DLL),
transaction programs (TPs) receive the extra data even though they should not.

CAUSE
=====

When sending data, the SNA Server EHNAPPC.DLL is passing the extra 4-byte Basic
APPC conversation header into the APPC data stream when using a MAPPED
conversation. However, it should ignore the 4-byte header. The header consists
of:

 - 2 bytes that are reserved for LL field designation.

 - 2 bytes for the length of the data field.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft modified the EHNAPPC.DLL file so that it only passed up the data to
the transaction program, not the 4-byte header.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
