TITLE   :BUG: NET.EXE Sorts International Names Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you create user or group accounts in User Manager that contain or start with
international characters, they are sorted as expected. However, when you use
"NET USER," "NET GROUP," or "NET LOCALGROUP" from the command line, those names
are sorted to the end of the list.

CAUSE
=====

NET.EXE uses a simple string compare and does not take account of locale
information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.51 and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
