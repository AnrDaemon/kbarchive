TITLE   :Cannot Build APPC Library DTRACS.LIB
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

DTRACS.LIB fails to build because the module APPC_C.C does not compile for
MS-DOS.

MS-DOS support for Windows APPC applications is provided by linking with the
call-level interface library called DOSACS.LIB. DTRACS.LIB is the traced version
of DOSACS.LIB, used for debugging an MS-DOS APPC transaction program (TP).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because full internal tracing is turned on.

RESOLUTION
==========

The makefile was updated to decrease the hard coded trace severity for
APPC_C.C.

Microsoft has updated the file <SNA_CD_Root>\SDK\LIB\MSDOS\DTRACS.LIB to
correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
