The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Connector PC MTA component of Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0, does not have a setting corresponding to the DrivesWAN .INI files
(or the -W command line option) setting in Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This
article describes how a Microsoft Mail Connector PC MTA instance can be
configured to operate in the DrivesWAN mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Mail 3.x, the DrivesWAN option causes the Microsoft Mail MTA
(EXTERNAL.EXE) to only send mail from the originating postoffice. It does not
distribute the mail to the users in the destination postoffice, nor does it
check the destination postoffice for outgoing mail.

Follow the steps below to configure a Microsoft Mail Connector PC MTA service to
perform similarly to the DrivesWAN option:

1. Select Connections, the MS Mail Connector Mail Connector, and then choose
   Properties from the File Menu.

2. In the Connector MTAs Property Page of the MS Mail Connector Properties, in
   the "MS Mail Connector (PC) MTA Services" list, select a PC MTA service and
   click Configure. This will bring up a dialog box with different configuration
   parameters. Click Options to bring up the MTA options. Select Disable Mailer;
   this will prevent the MTA from delivering mail to individual mailbags in the
   destination Microsoft Mail Postoffice. Click OK.

3. In the Connector MTAs Property Page, in the Postoffices Serviced list, select
   each postoffice name and then click Edit. Select "Do not pick up mail at this
   postoffice" and click OK. This will prevent the PC MTA instance from picking
   up mail from the selected postoffice.

NOTE: For information on setting up an instance of the PC MTA to service
different Microsoft Mail postoffices, please refer to the Microsoft Exchange
"Administrator's Guide."
