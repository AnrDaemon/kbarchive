TITLE   :XADM: Reply Rule Disabled When Deliver to Public Folder Via IMC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server public folder reply rules are disabled when messages
that match the reply rule criteria are delivered to the public folder via the
Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) from an unknown user external
to the Microsoft Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will typically occur when an external user on the Internet tries to
send mail to the SMTP address for a Microsoft Exchange public folder that has an
automatic reply rule enabled. However, this problem can also occur when two
Microsoft Exchange Servers are connected via an IMC to an IMC connection and the
user addresses have not been shared between the two Microsoft Exchange Servers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to the latest version of the Microsoft Exchange Server STORE.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
