TITLE   :LPR Printer Port Requires TCP/IP Address and Printer Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an LPR printer port, both the TCP/IP address and a printer or
print queue name are needed.

CAUSE
=====

The dialog box for adding LPR Printing was designed to require the user to enter
both a TCP/IP address and a name for the printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Lpdsvc.dll and Lpmon.dll have been updated in Service Pack 5 for Windows NT
3.51 to resolve the issue. With SP5, the Add LPR Compatible Printer dialog box
allows the user to enter a TCP/IP address without entering a printer or print
queue name in the definition.
