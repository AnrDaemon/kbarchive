 - Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Macintosh

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Encarta for the Macintosh, you may receive the following error
message:

   The correct fonts needed for Encarta are not installed. Please re-install
   Encarta from the CD-ROM.

When you start Encarta for the Macintosh 1997, you may receive the following
error message:

   Encarta Encyclopedia cannot find one or more of the fonts it uses. Encarta
   Encyclopedia will run without these fonts, but some text may not display
   properly. To correct the problem, reinstall from Encarta 97 Disc 1.

NOTE: Encarta 97 Encyclopedia uses the following fonts: Arial, HM Phonetic, MS
Reference, Symbol, and Times New Roman.

CAUSE
=====

The error message may be caused by either of the following conditions:

 - The V Lucida Sans font suitcase is not in the Fonts folder located in the
   System Folder.

   -or-

 - There are more than 128 font suitcases present in the Fonts folder in the
   System Folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the V Lucida Sans font suitcase is not in the Fonts folder, do the
following:

NOTE: System versions earlier than 7.1 do not contain a Fonts folder. If you have
a version earlier than 7.1, replace references to the Fonts folder with the
System suitcase in the following procedures.

1. Insert and open the Encarta compact disc.

2. Open the Installer Files folder.

3. Open the System Files folder.

4. Drag the V Lucida Sans suitcase into the Fonts folder located in the System
   Folder.

To determine if you have more than 128 font suitcases located in the Fonts folder
(located in your System Folder), and to correct the problem if that is the case,
follow these steps:

1. Open the System Folder.

2. Open the Fonts folder.

3. On the View menu, click By Kind. This arranges the Fonts folder contents so
   all of the font suitcases are in one location.

   NOTE: If there are more than 128 font suitcases within the Fonts folder,
   Encarta 1994 will fail to start.

4. If you have more than 128 font suitcases, remove the excess font suitcases
   from the Fonts folder by dragging them onto the desktop.

   NOTE: Do not delete the V Lucida Sans font suitcase located in the Fonts
   folder. Encarta fails to load if the font is removed.
