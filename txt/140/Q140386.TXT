SUMMARY
=======

Workstations that set the TEMP or TMP variable to a network drive may experience
sharing violation error messages while running some applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most applications that allow editing existing data files, create a temporary
copy of the file in a location described by the TEMP or TMP environmental
variable that is set on the workstation. If this variable points to a common
directory on the server that is used by multiple users concurrently, a sharing
violation message occurs whenever a an application attempts to create a
temporary file with the same name as an existing temporary file.
