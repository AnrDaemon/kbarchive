======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After the unattended installation of Windows NT is completed and the computer is
rebooted, the display settings dialog box appears requiring you to test the
display settings. The display setting test can be bypassed by modifying the
default SYSTEM hive in the \I386 directory after you copy it from the Windows NT
3.5 and 3.51 compact disc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An unattended installation is run by specifying the /U switch with Winnt.exe or
Winnt32.exe. For more information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q136153
   TITLE : Using an Answer File for an Unattended Installation

To bypass the display setting test, remove the DETECT value from the default
SYSTEM hive in \I386 directory after you copy it from the Windows NT 3.5 and
3.51 compact disc (The registry editor, Regedt32.exe, is required to modify the
SYSTEM hive.):

WARNING: Modification of the default SYSTEM hive can cause serious, system- wide
problems before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT to
correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems res ulting from the
modification of SYSTEM registry can be solved. Make the registry modifications
at your own risk.

1. From the Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 compact disc, copy the \I386 directory from
   the CD-ROM to the local directory. For example, if your CD-ROM drive is drive
   D and the local directory is on C:\NTSETUP, type the following:

   " xcopy d:\i386 c:\ntsetup" (without the quotation marks)

2. Expand System._ in the local directory by typing:

   expand -r system._

3. Rename the System._ file to System.bak.

To load SYSTEM hive into the registry
-------------------------------------

1. Run the registry editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the Registry menu, choose the Load Hive option.

   The Load Hive dialog box appears.

3. In the Drives scrolling list, select the drive which contains the SYSTEM
   hive.

4. In the Directories option box, choose the directory that contains the SYSTEM
   hive. The files in this directory now appear in the option box beneath the
   File Name option box.

5. Choose OK. A second "Load Hive" dialog box appears.

6. In this dialog box, enter SYS_TEMP and Choose OK.

   The SYS_TEMP hive now appears as subkey of the HKEY_USERS and
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE predefined keys.

7. Click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE window and choose DETECT value in
   \SYS_TEMP\System\ControlSet01\GraphicDrivers.

8. Remove the DetectDisplay value by pressing the DELETE key.

To unload the SYS_TEMP hive from the Registry
---------------------------------------------

1. Choose SYS_TEMP hive.

2. From the Registry menu, choose the Unload Hive option.

The SYS_TEMP hive that you have unloaded no longer exists in the registry and it
is saved as SYSTEM hive in the local directory.
