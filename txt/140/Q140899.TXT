TITLE   :BUG: GPF When RecordSource Property is Blank at Design-Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A data control causes an application error at runtime if the data control
contains with a blank RecordSource property at design time and the
UpdateControls method is executed. The application error ends Visual Basic.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this bug, at design time, set the data control's DatabaseName
property to a database and the RecordSource property to a table in the database.
Other controls that are bound to the data control, such as a text box, should
also have a value in the control's DataSource property

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
