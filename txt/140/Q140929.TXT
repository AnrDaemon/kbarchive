PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a shared application, you experience a General Protection (GP)
Fault in APPSTART.EXE.

This symptom occurs sporadically.

CAUSE
=====

The program tries to add more information to the internal buffer used by
APPSTART for loading the directory names even though that buffer is already
full.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft
does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
