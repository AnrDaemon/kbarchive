The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1

SYMPTOMS
========

Some project configurations may cause the Go To Error/Tag functionality in the
Developer Studio to fail when you double-click (or press F4) the compile results
in the output window.

CAUSE
=====

A subproject or main project that refers to an Include file in a directory
outside of the default directory may exhibit this behavior. For example, a
workspace with the following directory structure will produce the problem if a
compiler error is generated in MyIncludeFile.h. The subproject source files are
in the directory .

\Subproject./>
\toplevel
    .\subproject
    .\include

The .\Include directory contains files that the project source file references
with this syntax:

      #include "MyIncludeFile.h"

The build settings for the compiler preprocessor for the project has its
Additional Include Directories field set to:

   .\Include

RESOLUTION
==========

Either put the Include files in the .\Subproject directory, or give the complete
path name in the compiler preprocessor's Additional Include Directories field:

   <drive>:\toplevel\include

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 5.
