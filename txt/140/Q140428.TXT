             all display)

         to remove all)
   /Y Install without copying files

CAUSE

supported.

STATUS

Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following switches are supported by Microsoft Plus! Setup:

   /G filename - Specify filename, such as Pluslog.txt, to create a
                 text log of the Setup process.

   /U[A]       - Starts Setup in maintenance mode. Removes Microsoft
                 Plus! components without prompting.

                 NOTE: This does not remove DriveSpace 3 if there is an
                 existing compressed DriveSpace 3 volume.

   /R          - Starts Setup in maintenance mode. Reinstalls components
                 without prompting.

   /Y          - Runs Setup without copying the Microsoft Plus! files to
                 the hard disk. However, depending on the components that
                 are selected, the original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM may
                 be required so that Windows 95 files can be copied. In
                 addition, you may receive missing file error messages
                 when Setup calls the Internet Explorer Setup Wizard or
                 the Desktop Themes tool.
