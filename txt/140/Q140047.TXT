TITLE   :Eicon Diva ISDN PC-Card Setup Disables Mass-Storage Devices
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbhw kbsetup kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the driver for Eicon Diva ISDN PC-Card devices on your
computer, PC-Card adapters connecting mass-storage devices (such as SCSI
adapters or IDE hard disks) stop working. Another symptom of this problem is
that mass-storage devices you are trying to install may not work if you already
have the Eicon product installed.

CAUSE
=====

The setup program for the Eicon Diva ISDN adapter changes the startup value for
the PCMCIA driver to "System." To work for mass-storage devices, this driver
must be set to "Boot."

This problem exists in the Eicon driver that ships with the Windows NT 4.0
compact disc. Eicon is aware of this.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click Devices.

2. In the Device list, click Pcmcia, click Startup, and then click Boot.

3. Click OK, and then click Close.
