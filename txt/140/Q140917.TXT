TITLE   :SMS Sender Sets Enormous Estimated Bandwidth in Registry
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork smssenders kbSMSSender

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server Sender-based bandwidth control writes a initial
Estimated Bandwidth of 0xffffffff bytes per second (very large) in the registry.
When you first use the Addresses dialog box in Sender Manager to modify an
Address-based bandwidth, the Estimated Bandwidth is set to an appropriate
(lower) value. By default, this value is 0x138880 (10,000 decimal).

However, if you use the Sender dialog box in Sender Manager, this initial value
is not lowered and Systems Management Server assumes you have erroneously large
bandwidth.

This error results in the Sender stopping under some conditions.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, in Sender Manager, use the Senders dialog box to
set the Estimated Bandwidth appropriately and then open the Addresses dialog box
and choose OK to close it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
