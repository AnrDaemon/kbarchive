TITLE   :Error When Copying Files from OS/2 2.x Client Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to copy files with extended attributes from an OS/2 2.x client
computer to a Windows NT 3.5x Server, the server returns the following error
message:

   Access denied.

The problem only occurs when extended attributes are applied on files to
transfer. The problem does not occur when using the WinOS2 emulation on the
client workstation or when using an OS/2 1.x LAN Manager client.

CAUSE
=====

The LAN server OS/2 2.x redirector does not correctly activate the following
bits in the Server Message Block (SMB) Transact2_open frame header:

   SMB : Flags2 summary = 0 (0x0)

The second bit (bit 1) should be 1 instead of 0 to indicate that extended
attributes are supported during the transaction. Windows NT Server checks this
flag, and if extended attributes are used without the flag's being activated,
the SMB response frame is to return the access denied message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Customers encountering this unexpected behavior should contact IBM technical
support for further information.
