TITLE   :Error Using Uplodprf on NTFS Volumes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use UPLODPRF (cps) with the -a switch to upload the entire volume, the
error message, "(32) File is in use by another process" appears. The UPLODPRF
utility stops processing and exits to the command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

UPLODPRF is stopping on the pagefile. This only happens on NTFS volumes and when
using the -a switch is used. If you use the /dir option, processing starts, but
errors out trying to set attributes on the pagefile.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three workarounds to this problem. They are as follows:

 - Move the pagefile to a different partition than the one being profiled.

 - Use the FAT file system on the Master system and convert to NTFS on the
   target system during the Winntp portion of CPS. For additional information,
   please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q136636
   TITLE : Converting to NTFS

 - The uplodprf command also has a switch, \dir. This switch will allow for a
   specific directory(s) to be uploaded to the distribution server, in addition
   to the \systemroot.

Example command line syntax:

   uplodprf /s:w:\ /i:profile.ini \users \win32app

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Resource Kit 3.51. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
