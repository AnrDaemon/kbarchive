TITLE   :Job Status MIFs Cause Overhead on Central Site

SUMMARY
=======

On a central site with 20,000 inventoried machines, if you send 2 mandatory jobs
to all machines set to run the same night, in a period of a few hours, close to
40,000 job status mifs are forwarded to the central site.

This chokes the central site. It takes the dataloader days to catch up, causing
inventory and events to be delayed. The extra overhead of the despooler
receiving the packages, and dataloader and site reporter processing the mifs
would cause the site to slow down.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Distribute the packages from the central site, but connect the UI to each second
tier site to send the job to all machines in that site and its children. With
the central site no longer the originating site for the workstation jobs, job
overhead is distributed to the second tier sites.
