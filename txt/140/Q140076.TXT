TITLE   :PC Gen: Err Msg: User <Mailbox Name> Not in the POL...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2a,3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

GIMPORT.EXE does not simplify the administrative overhead associated with groups
spanning multiple postoffices. Every member of a group spanning multiple
postoffices MUST exist in the Postoffice Address List (POL) prior to running
GIMPORT, or you will get the following error for each user not on the list:

   User "mailbox name" not in postoffice address list. Cannot add to group XXX.

CAUSE
=====

One or more users in the group file that spans multiple postoffices was not
present in the POL prior to running GIMPORT.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order for the GIMPORT process to work correctly, each External postoffice
must have all users from all other External postoffices appear in their POL
prior to running GIMPORT.EXE. GIMPORT can only create, modify, or delete groups
containing Microsoft Mail users that are present in the POL.

NOTE: You can automatically add users to the POL by using the IMPORT.EXE program
that is included with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

All users included in the group file spanning multiple postoffices will have to
be manually added to each of the External Postoffice Lists prior to executing
the GIMPORT process.
