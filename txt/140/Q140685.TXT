TITLE   :MAC Clients Get Access Denied on Newly Created Folders
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a user on a MAC client creates a folder on a Windows NT Services for
Macintosh server, they receive Access Denied when trying to access the folder.
Examination of the permissions on the new folder will show it is owned by an
unknown user and the primary group is some random domain that has a trust with
the SFM servers domain. For example:

   Owner: account unknown
   Primary Group: America domain no permissions
   Everyone: no permissions

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by incorrect trust information.


WORKAROUND
==========

Delete all the trusts, then recreate them. Allow time for the trust information
to replicate to the BDCs and then reboot all servers running the Services for
Macintosh service.


RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT 3.51.

STATUS
======
