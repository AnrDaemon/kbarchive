TITLE   :FIX:ClassView Add Function/Variable Fails If Header File Moved
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.00 4.10
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC400bug kbVC410bug kbVC420fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to add a function or variable to a class by using ClassView fails and
returns this message:

   One or more of the files for <class name> are read-only.

Here <class name> corresponds to the class that is selected.


CAUSE
=====

This is a bug that occurs if the header file for the class has been moved from
its original directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Either choose not to move the header files from their original location, or add
member functions and variables manually if you must move the files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++, 32-bit
Edition, version 4.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Moving the wizard-generated header files to another directory results in their
appearing as read-only when you attempt to use the ClassView add function or add
variable commands. Even if you add the new directory to the include directory
search path and update all dependencies, this problem persists.

The files are not really read-only; they can be opened for editing through all
available avenues.

Additional query words: class view workspace
