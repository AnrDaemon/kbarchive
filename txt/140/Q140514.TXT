SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released an enhanced version of the Unimodem VxD for Windows 95
that is optimized for use with the new line of voice-capable modems being
released by numerous vendors. These modems are listed in the Unimodem V
Readme.txt file.

To showcase some of the advanced TAPI abilities of Unimodem V, an application
known as Operator Agent is included with Unimodem V. Operator Agent monitors the
modem and directs incoming calls to Microsoft Fax, Dial-Up Server, or a Windows
95 voice messaging application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use Operator Agent, a voice messaging application must be running in addition
to either Dial-Up Server or Microsoft Fax. No voice messaging application is
included with Unimodem V or Windows 95.

The primary purpose of Operator Agent is to allow software application developers
to write and implement voice messaging software in Windows 95. For information
about how to use Operator Agent, please see the Readme.txt file that is provided
with Unimodem V.

NOTE: The Unimodem V Readme.txt file is also available in the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q140323 Microsoft Unimodem V Readme.txt File

By default, Operator Agent answers calls and plays a greeting notifying the
caller to press 1 for voice mail, 2 for fax, or 3 for data. This order can be
adjusted by clicking Properties in the Microsoft Operator Agent dialog box and
then clicking Call Routing Priorities. If you change the Call Routing
properties, you must use a microphone to record a new greeting. To change the
default greeting, click Properties and then click Initial Greeting. If Operator
Agent cannot determine the type of incoming call, it passes the call to the
first application listed in the Call Routing properties.

Please note that if a 16-bit program has control of the modem when an incoming
call is detected, Operator Agent cannot answer the call, or displays an "Out of
memory" error message.
