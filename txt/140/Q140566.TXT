TITLE   :FIX: Click Event Of Straight Line Not Firing
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a horizontal or vertical line object is on a form and there is code in the
Click event of the line, the code will not execute if the line Width property of
a vertical line or Height property of a horizontal line is set to 0.

WORKAROUND
==========

For a verticle line, set the line object's Width property to at least 1 and the
BorderWidth property to at least 2. If the BorderWidth property is less than 2,
the vertical line will not be displayed correctly. For a horizontal line, set
the Height property to at least 1 and the BorderWidth property to at least 1
(the default).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem (the vertical line has to have a BorderWidth value of at least 2 to
display correctly), does not appear for diagonal lines. This is why setting the
line width or height corrects the problem. The line is actually being angled
slightly. This angling is not visibly apparent even in large displays or form
sizes. However because the borderwidth has been increased a hairline thickness
is not possible. This characteristic is more noticable with vertical rather than
horizontal lines because of the way the monitor displays graphics.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Put a vertical line object control on the form.

3. Put a horizontal line object control on the form.

4. In the Click events of the line objects, place this code:

      wait window "click"

5. Run the form.

6. Click the lines. You will notice that the wait window does not appear for
   either line.

Steps to Work Around the Problem
--------------------------------

1. Change the Width property of the vertical line control to 1 and the
   BorderWidth property to 2.

2. Change the Width property of the horizontal line to 1.

3. Run the form.

4. Click the lines. Notice that the wait window appears for each line. The click
   events of the lines are firing.
