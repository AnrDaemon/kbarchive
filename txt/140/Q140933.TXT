TITLE   :XFOR: SMTP Proxy Address Generated Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, in the Configuration container,
Site Addressing object, Site Addressing property page, the SMTP address
generator will not generate SMTP addresses using the first letter(s) of a name.
This means you cannot generate SMTP addresses automatically like:

   pbunyan@company.com

where "p" is the first letter of the first name "Paul" and "bunyan" is the last
name.

CAUSE
=====

The SMTP address generation did not implement the %n feature, where "n" is a
number, that allows you to specify how many characters of a name field you want
to use in an SMTP address. This differs from the way Microsoft Exchange Server
alias and display names are generated in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program using the Options command on the Tools menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMTP address generator can be configured to use the first name, last name,
alias or display name by following the chart below:

%g           given name (first name)
%s           surname (last name)
%m           alias
%d           display name
%r ch1 ch2   replace the first character(s) (ch1) with the second
             character(s) (ch2). If ch1 and c2 are the same, ch1 will be
             deleted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   S E R V P A C K

Now you can specify the number of characters, up to 99, in the given name,
surname, alias or display name that you want defined. For example, to create an
SMTP address with the given name and the first 2 letters of the last name, use
the following formula in the Site Addressing, SMTP proxy:

   %g%2s@company.com
