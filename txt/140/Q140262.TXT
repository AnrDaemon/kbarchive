======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Internet Mail from a Microsoft Exchange, version 4.0, Windows 95
client, the following error message may be displayed:

   An error prevented processing the message to completion. The original message
   is contained in the attached text file MESSAGE.TXT.

CAUSE
=====

This error message indicates that Internet Mail received a message or attachment
that was corrupt, or in a format Internet Mail could not understand and decode.
When this happens, Internet Mail saves the message as a separate file, called
MESSAGE.TXT.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you receive a message in a format that Internet Mail cannot decode, you
should contact the sender for the format used, and obtain a decoder for that
format. You can then use the decoder on the MESSAGE.TXT file, allowing you to
successfully read the message.
