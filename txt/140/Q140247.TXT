KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new gateway entry to the Personal Address Book (PAB) of a Remote
client running against a postoffice (PO) in another language, you will receive
the following error message in the appropriate language:

   A TPL file is missing from your server - contact your administrator.

CAUSE
=====

The TPL file that corresponds to the gateway in the language of the remote
client is missing from the TPL directory on the postoffice and the Remote
client. Each gateway has corresponding TPL files in the various languages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use Mail Remote for Windows with a PO in a different language, you must first
copy the TPL files associated with the appropriate gateway from a PO in the same
language as the Remote client to the PO. Then use the Regenerate command from
the Remote menu before you create the data disk for the remote user.
