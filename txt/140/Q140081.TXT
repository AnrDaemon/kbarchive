SUMMARY
=======

When you install Microsoft Plus!, Setup installs the Sound Mixing Configuration
tool (Wmconfig.exe) if a sound card is detected.

Wmconfig.exe is a tool that sends setup information obtained from the Wavemix.inf
file to supported sound cards for the 3D Pinball game. In some cases, you may be
able to use Wmconfig.exe to eliminate static or popping sounds.

NOTE: Microsoft does not provide support or technical information concerning the
use of Wmconfig.exe or modification of the Wavemix.inf file.

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

3. In the sound card box, click your sound card.

4. Click Test.
