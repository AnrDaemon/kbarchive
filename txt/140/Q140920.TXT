The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you execute a pending MSTest 3.0 Run Command on Workstation Job in Package
Command Manager, the following error message appears:

   Package Command Manager

   Package Command Manager is unable to install a package because the package is
   setup incorrectly. PCM has logged an event and sent it to your System
   Administrator.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has modified the files, PCMWin16.exe and PCMWin32.exe, to correct this
problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a sample content of the PCMWin.log file:

   Connecting to package server...
   Invalidated command line is mtrun.exe audit.pcd...
   Location of the MSTest dir is....
   Change to pkg shr...
   Then runs the command line mtrun from the MSTEST dir (not the package
    share)
   Package is not setup correctly.
   Running process handle=-1

This information is also logged if you use MSTEST 3.0 and MTRUN in the package
source instead of in the MSTEST directory; or if you are using Visual Test 4.0
and MTRUN is in the MSTEST directory.
