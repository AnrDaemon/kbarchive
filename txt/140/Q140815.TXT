-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Wall Data 4.1 3270 emulator disconnects if you press the the PF1 function key.

CAUSE
=====

The Wall Data 4.1 3270 emulator sends FMI STATUS (ACK) messages in response to
RQE data with random values in the message key and sequence number fields.

Most of the time the SNA Server service ignores these messages. However, if the
message key is what the SNA Server service is expecting but the sequence number
is incorrect, then the SNA Server service closes the PLU- SLU connection with
the emulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has corrected this problem. The fix causes EventID 61 to be logged the
first time that the node receives an invalid STATUS ACK from an emulator.
Further, if a registry entry is set, it does not close the PLU-SLU connection on
receiving one of the illegal messages which have the correct message key.

This registry entry is located under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, under the
following subkey:

   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaServr\  Parameters

The entry is:

   Value Name: BADSEQNO
   Data Type:  REG_SZ

This registry entry is considered turned on if it is set to any value.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNASERVR.EXE
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\TRCSERVR.EXE
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNAEVENT.DLL

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
