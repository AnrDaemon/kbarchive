SUMMARY
=======

The Help topic for the DBGETPROP() function incorrectly lists Updatable and
Updatename as properties for views in Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3.0. DBGETPROP
returns "Property is not found" when specifying either of these properties for a
view. These properties are not listed in Help under DBGETPROP() Views in
Microsoft Visual FoxPro Version 3.0b.

Additional query words: VFoxWin
