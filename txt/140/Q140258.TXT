TITLE   :Incomplete Server List in File Manager Connection Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Workstations and Servers do not see all the Servers available in a
domain from the Connect Network Dive dialog box in File Manager. Attempts to
browse the domain from a command prompt with the NET VIEW command succeed with
all the servers shown correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Shared Directories list box generated in the Connect Network Drive dialog
box fails to enumerate a complete list of servers. The enumeration of servers is
incomplete because the buffer passed from MPRUI.DLL (responsible for filling the
list box) to NTLANMAN.DLL (responsible for enumerating the servers) to retrieve
the list of server names is too small. NTLANMAN.DLL returns a status code
indicating that a larger buffer size is required to hold the server names, but
also returns some unexpected server names in the small buffer. MPRUI.DLL resizes
the buffer, but does not add any of the unexpected server names returned from
NTLANMAN.DLL in the original, smaller buffer to the Shared Directories list
box.

The incomplete list of servers is caused by NTLANMAN.DLL returning server name
entries while requesting a larger buffer size from MPRUI.DLL. The set of
circumstances that cause NTLANMAN.DLL to return server names, and request a
larger buffer size are very infrequent resulting in about six server names being
dropped from a potential list of three hundred.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

======
