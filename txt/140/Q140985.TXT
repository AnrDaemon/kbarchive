TITLE   :BUG: Service Pack 3 Causes Updated Epson Stylus to Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDriver

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You can experience heap corruption when using Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 3 and
the updated Epson Stylus driver that supports 720 DPI printing. Typically the
system will slow down and eventually lock up during print operations.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of the problem is related to Service Pack 3 installing an earlier
version of the following files:

RASDD.DLL
RASDDUI.CNT
RASDDUI.DLL

RESOLUTION
==========

Steps to Resolve Problem
------------------------

1. Download the updated Epson Stylus drivers from the following locations:

   FTP:

   Bussys\winnt\winnt-public\drivers\3.51\Epson\<Platform>

2. Remove the existing Printer. (From Printmanager, select the Epson Stylus
   driver and choose "Remove Printer" from the Printer Menu.)

3. Expand the newly downloaded files into a separate directory, and do the
   following:

   a. In Control Panel, choose the Print Manager icon. The Print Manager opens.
      From the Printer menu, choose Create Printer. The Create Printer dialog
      box appears.

   b. Expand the Driver drop-down list by clicking its down arrow. Scroll to the
      bottom of the list and select Other. The Install Driver dialog box will
      appear.

   c. Either insert the disk you made during the downloading procedure, or type
      the path of the directory where you downloaded the driver. Then choose the
      OK button. A Select Driver dialog box appears, listing one or more
      printers.

   d. In the Printer Driver list, select the printer you want, and choose the OK
      button. Windows NT copies the needed file(s) and returns you to the Create
      Printer dialog box.

   e. Fill in the rest of the information fields, and choose OK.

   f. For instructions on how to configure your printer, see the section for the
      Print Manager in the "Microsoft Windows NT System Guide."

Alternative Procedure
---------------------

1. Remove the Printer from PrintManager. Locate the following Directory in
   FileManager:

   <NTDIR>\system32\spool\drivers\<Platform Specific>\1

2. Rename the following files to *.OLD

   RASDD.DLL
   RASDDUI.DLL

3. Run PrintManager again and re-install the Epson Stylus driver.
