KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbVC410fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the infoview viewer window, when an item is selected from the See Also
drop-down list, the Go Back button on the toolbar of the window may be disabled
after the new topic comes up.

RESOLUTION
==========

To go back to the previous topic, you need to search for the topic again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce this behavior, select the Project Workspace window, and press the
F1 key to bring up help for the Project Workspace Window. In the viewer window,
click the See Also button, and select a different topic in the drop- down list.
Once help on that topic comes up, the Go Back button cannot be used to go back
to the previous topic.

You may also see this behavior in the regular help viewer window, but it does not
happen very often.
