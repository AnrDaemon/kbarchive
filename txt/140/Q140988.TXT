TITLE   :BUG: Negative File Size Replacing File Over 2 Gigabytes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you replace a two-gigabyte or larger file from within File Manager, the
"Confirm File Replace" dialog box shows a negative value rather than the
expected value of the file. For example, the dialog box may show:

   Replace File:     C:\TEMP\TEXT.TXT
                               -2147483648 bytes 1/1/80 12:00:00 AM

   With File:        C:\TEMP2\TEXT.TXT
                                1024 bytes 1/1/80 12:00:00 AM

When the actual file sizes are:

   C:\TEMP\TEXT.TXT   2147483648 bytes
   C:\TEMP2\TEXT.TXT  1024 bytes

RESOLUTION
==========

The file is correctly replaced without error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
