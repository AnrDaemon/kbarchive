You can replace the value in a grid cell with the value contained in the grid
cell that lies above it. This article shows by example how to create a command
button on a form that can perform this operation.

================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form, and add a table to the data environment.

2. Drag the table from the data environment onto the form to create a new grid.

3. Place a command button on the form, and add the following code to its click
   event:

      ThisForm.Grid1.SetFocus
      ThisForm.LockScreen = .T.
      IF ThisForm.Grid1.RelativeRow = 1
         =MESSAGEBOX("You cannot do this replacement from the top "+;
            "of the Grid.",16,"")
         *: If the active grid cell is in the top row of the grid, this
         *: will display a message to the user.
      ELSE
         RepField = FIELD(ThisForm.Grid1.ActiveColumn)
         ColumnNumber = "Column"+ALLTRIM(STR(ThisForm.Grid1.ActiveColumn))
         ThisForm.GRID1.ACTIVATECELL(ThisForm.GRID1.RELATIVEROW-1,;
            ThisForm.GRID1.RELATIVECOLUMN)
         RepValue = ThisForm.Grid1.&ColumnNumber..Text1.Value
         ThisForm.GRID1.ACTIVATECELL(ThisForm.GRID1.RELATIVEROW+1,;
            ThisForm.GRID1.RELATIVECOLUMN)
         yesno = MESSAGEBOX("Are you certain that you wish to replace "+;
            CHR(13)+"Field "+UPPER(repField)+" current value?",36,"")
         IF yesno = 6
            REPLACE &RepField WITH RepValue
            ThisForm.REFRESH
         ELSE
            WAIT WINDOW "Replacement Canceled" NOWAIT
         ENDIF
      ENDIF
      ThisForm.LockScreen = .F.

4. Close, Save, and use the DO command to run the form. Place the insertion
   point in any cell of the grid, and click the command button. If the pointer
   has been placed in a cell that is in the top row of the grid, you should
   observe the "You cannot do this replacement from the top of the grid"
   message. Otherwise, you should see the "Are you certain..." message. If you
   click Yes, the replacement should occur. If you click No, a wait window
   indicating "Replacement Canceled" should appear.
