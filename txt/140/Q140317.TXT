The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

There are four differences regarding how Visual SourceSafe treats binary files.
The Help file gives only three of them, but the "User's Guide" gives all four.

How Visual SourceSafe Treats Binary Files
-----------------------------------------

There are three differences regarding how Visual SourceSafe treats binary files
that are significant.

The Help file describes only three differences for how Visual SourceSafe treats
binary files as follows:

 - Internally, Visual SourceSafe's mechanisms for storing changes differs for
   text files (which have distinct lines as units of comparison) and binary
   files (which have no obvious line delimiter). That's why it is important for
   Visual SourceSafe to correctly identify the type of a file. The wrong type
   does not result in errors, but it makes Visual SourceSafe's algorithms much
   less efficient.

 - Another area of difference is with respect to the Show Differences command.
   With a binary file, Visual SourceSafe stores each change as a small record of
   which bytes moved where: useful for reconstructing earlier versions, but not
   for display. Therefore, when you use the Show Differences command on a binary
   file, Visual SourceSafe can tell you if the file has changed; but it cannot
   display how the file has changed.

 - The third difference occurs with end-of-line characters. With a text file,
   Visual SourceSafe automatically translates end-of-line characters between
   different operating systems; with a binary file, Visual SourceSafe never
   alters the contents of the file in any way (except for keyword expansion).

The "User's Guide," however, mentions an additional difference:

 - Another difference in Visual SourceSafe's treatment of binary files compared
   with text files is that binary files cannot be merged. Therefore, multiple
   checkouts cannot be done with binary files.
