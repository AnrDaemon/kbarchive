TITLE   :FIX: ClassView Cannot Find Function That Has Been Moved
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbide kbVC400bug kbVC500bug kbVC600fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a function definition is moved to a different place in a source file,
navigating to that function from ClassView will no longer work. ClassView will
jump to the line in the source file where the function used to be defined.

CAUSE
=====

ClassView uses bookmarks to determine where to jump to in the file. The
bookmarks are not updated until the file is saved.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the source file.

Visual C++ 6.0 dynamically updates the information in ClassView, so saving the
source file is unnecessary for the updated location to be recognized.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++, version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To observe this behavior, save the following sample file. Move one of the
function definitions to a different line, and then attempt to use ClassView to
navigate to that function

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: none
      */ 

      class TestClass {
      public:
         void FuncA( void );
         void FuncB( void );
         void FuncC( void );
         TestClass(){;}
         ~TestClass(){;}
      };
      void TestClass::FuncA( void ){}
      void TestClass::FuncB( void ){}
      void TestClass::FuncC( void ){}
