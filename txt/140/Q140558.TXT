======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks (Vredir.vxd) to connect
to a Samba file server running on a UNIX-based computer and you try to delete
files on the server, you may delete files on your Windows 95-based computer
instead.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Samba file servers let you create file names with
characters that are invalid in Windows 95. These invalid characters include the
following characters:

 - backslash (\)

 - asterisk (*)

 - question mark (?)

For example, Samba file servers let you create file names such as "c:\*.*"
(without the quotation marks) or "\\server\share\*.*" (without the quotation
marks). If a UNIX user creates a file called "c:\*.*" and shares it, a Windows
95 user who connects to the server and tries to delete the file with Windows
Explorer or My Computer may delete all the files in the root directory of local
drive C instead.

NOTE: You are not affected by this problem if any of the following conditions are
true:

 - You are not connected to a local area network.

 - You do not use a dial-up application (such as Dial-Up Networking) to dial
   into a local area network.

 - You are connected to a local area network, but you do not connect to Samba
   file servers running on UNIX-based computers.

 - You connect to Samba file servers running on UNIX-based computers but you
   delete only files you created with Windows Explorer or My Computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although this is not a problem with Windows 95, Microsoft has released a new
version of the Vredir.vxd file (version 4.00.955) that filters out files that
have file names with invalid characters. When you use the updated version of the
Vredir.vxd file, you cannot see these files and cannot, therefore, try to delete
them.
