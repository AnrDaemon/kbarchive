TITLE   :XADM: Errors Processing Incoming Replication Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to select the system folders from the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program the following error may occur:

   An internal processing error has occurred: naming violation. Try restarting
   the Administrator Program or the Microsoft Exchange Server computer, or
   both.

   Microsoft Exchange Directory ID No: DS_E_NAMING_VIOLATION

This will also be paired with an error in the Application Log. The application
log message SOURCE will be the MSExchangeIS Public, the EVENT ID will be 3089,
the CATEGORY will be Replication and Type will be Warning. The description will
read as follows:

   Error 0x8004010f occurred while processing an incoming replication message.

CAUSE
=====

When you select the properties of a system folder, the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program is calling the Microsoft Exchange Directory (DS) and
asking for a site id from a table in the database. The DS does not have an entry
in that field to return and generates the above error messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
