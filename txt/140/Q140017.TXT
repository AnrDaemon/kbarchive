TITLE   :BUG: RasDial() Fails with Error 87 in 16-bit App in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbAPI kbRAS kbSDKPlatform kbOSWin95 kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A function call to the RasDial() API from a 16-bit Windows-based application
that is running in Windows 95 fails with error 87 in Windows 95 if the
hWndNotifier parameter of the RasDial() API is initialized to a NULL value.

RESOLUTION
==========

An application should always provide a window handle for this parameter even if
it will not be processing the messages posted by the RAS DLLs to this window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Specifying a NULL value for window handle in the RasDial() API call is common
for a Visual Basic application. In such a scenario, the application makes
repetitive calls to RasGetConnectStatus() to get the status of the connection.
However, calling RasDial() in this fashion causes it to fail on Windows 95 with
error 87.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
