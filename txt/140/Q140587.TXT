======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a modal CPropertySheet is created, the default button is the OK button. To
change the default to a different button, derive a class from CPropertySheet,
override OnInitDialog(), and send a message of DM_SETDEFID to the sheet with the
ID of the new button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IDs of the buttons that are created in a modal CPropertySheet are:

   IDOK            - OK button
   IDCANCEL        - Cancel button
   ID_APPLY_NOW    - Apply button
   IDHELP          - Help button

Before you can set the focus to a button, the button must exist and be enabled.
By default, the Apply button on a modal CPropertySheet is not enabled; it has to
be explicitly enabled as shown in the sample code in this article.

If you want a button other than these default buttons to have the default focus,
you have to create the button, say IDC_MYBUTTON, and set focus to that button
using:

      SendMessage (DM_SETDEFID, IDC_MYBUTTON);

Sample Code
-----------

   // This code sets the Apply button as the default
   // CMySheet is derived from CPropertySheet

   BOOL CMySheet::OnInitDialog()
   {
           CPropertySheet::OnInitDialog();

           // Enable the Apply button
           GetPage(0)->SetModified ();
           // Set the Apply button as the default button
           SendMessage (DM_SETDEFID, ID_APPLY_NOW);

           return TRUE;
   }
