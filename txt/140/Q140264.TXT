TITLE   :Issues with Multiple Concentrators with Digi DIGIFEP5.SYS Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) servers with multiple Digiboard
multi-serial adapters attached to 30 or more ports, you may encounter problems
with ports not resetting, users being disconnected, and "Line Non-Operational"
errors when you view the ports in RASADMIN. Additionally, the RAS connection is
intermittently slow .

This problem can be seen on models that utilize the DIGIFEP5.SYS driver.

The ports that are affected do not reactivate until you stop the RAS service and
the Digifep5 driver.

NOTE: To stop the services from the command line, type:

   NET STOP REMOTEACCESS

   NET STOP DIGIFEP5


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix
to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
