PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You can only use one client/server protocol to communicate with a SNA Server
from a Windows NT SNA Server Client and the Client Setup erroneously displays
the following Select Client/Server Protocols dialog if multiple protocols are
detected on the Windows NT system:

   Several client/server protocols have been detected on this computer.

   SNA Client can work with any or all of them. Please choose the ones you want
   by clicking on their check boxes.

   Microsoft Networking (Named Pipes)
   Novell Netware
   Banyan Vines
   TCP/IP

When you choose Help for this dialog box, the following information appears:

   

   Select Client/Server Protocol

   If Setup detects more than one client/server protocol on your computer, you
   must specify the client/server protocol(s) to use with SNA Server.

   To select client/server protocols

   1. In the Select Client/Server Protocols dialog box, select one, several, or all
   of the check boxes:

   Microsoft Networking (Named Pipes)
   Novell NetWare (IPX/SPX) (see Note on SPXII Protocol)
   Banyan VINES (see Note on Banyan Vines )
   TCP/IP (see Note on TCP/IP Protocol)
   (SNA servers only:) AppleTalk

   If the computer you are installing on does not include one or several of the
   client/server protocols, the corresponding check boxes are unavailable.

   2. Choose Continue.

   You will be prompted to supply the name of the network domain or SNA Server
   Subdomain.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT SNA Server Client Setup program was calling the same
"Client/Server Protocol" information called during SNA Server Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

The setup scripts for the Windows NT SNA Server Client have been modified so
that the Client/Server Protocol dialogs return information specific to the
Windows NT SNA Server Client.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\SETUP.INF
   <snaroot>\SNAFILES.INF

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
