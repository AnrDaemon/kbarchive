-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the PVCS_SS conversion utility, you may receive an error telling
you that a PVCS log file may be corrupt. PVCS_SS then causes the MS-DOS session
to hang (stop responding to input).

CAUSE
=====

PVCS for Windows NT uses a different data/time scheme in the log files. The
PVSC_SS utility was written to accept the date from the old PVCS log files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
