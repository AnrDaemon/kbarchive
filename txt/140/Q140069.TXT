the appropriate drive.

If the disk asked for is not available, use the following procedure to complete
the procedure:

1. Press the CTRL+X keys to exit the Setup program and return to the MS-DOS
   prompt.

2. Place the version 3.5 Supplementary Modem Scripts disk in the disk drive.

3. Use the MS-DOS utility EXPAND.EXE to expand the desired script from the
   disk.

   NOTE: EXPAND.EXE can usually be found in DOS subdirectory.

4. Place the disk labeled Remote MS-DOS-based Workstation Version - Disk 1-Setup
   in the floppy drive, and run the Setup program.

5. When the Script Install Selection screen appears, highlight the option
   Location of Additional Script files..., and press the ENTER key. Then
   continue with the Selected Options.

   NOTE: Do not select scripts from the list, as this will cause the error again.

6. The next screen will prompt for the directory or drive that contains
   additional modem scripts for Mail Remote. Type the path to the previously
   expanded script files as specified in step 4.
