PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:4.0 4.1 4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbVC500fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build an AppWizard-generated application that has a directory with a
trailing backslash (\) specified in the Additional Include Directories field of
the C/C++ Preprocessor settings, you receive this error:

   

   Compiling...
   StdAfx.cpp
   LINK : fatal error LNK1561: entry point must be defined
   Error executing cl.exe.

CAUSE
=====

The backslash (\) character is interpreted as an escape character.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not include trailing backslashes in the
Additional Include Directories field of the C/C++ Preprocessor settings. For
example, specify directories as C:\Project\Inc rather than as C:\Project\Inc\.
Or if you want to specify the current directory as .\, use just the period (.)
instead.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
