TITLE   :SNA Server Internal Traces Do Not Log SNA Server Version
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server version number is not logged in SNA Server internal traces when
they are enabled for diagnostic purposes.

This symptom occurs whether the internal traces are enabled on the SNA Server
computer or SNA Server client computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNATRC.DLL to improve SNA
Server tracing. SNA Server now queries the SNA Server version information from
certain SNA Server files. When the internal trace files are created or wrapped,
the file names and their versions are written as part of the file header. The
following are the SNA Server files for which version information is obtained:

   SNABASE.EXE
   SNASERVR.EXE
   SNADMOD.DLL
   SNALINK.DLL
   SNALINK.EXE
   SNACFG.DLL
   SNAMANAG.DLL
   SNAADMIN.EXE

Note: The update only applies to the SNA Server server and the 32-bit SNA Server
clients (Windows NT & Windows 95). The update does not apply to 16- bit
(Windows 3.x) clients.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
