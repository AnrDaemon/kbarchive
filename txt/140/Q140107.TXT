The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

You can create a Mail message template that can be used for sending the same
type of message to the same recipients. The instructions for creating the
template are outlined in the Microsoft Mail on-line help file, MSMAIL.HLP.

After you create a template, you can move the template to a special folder for
later use. However, a message template cannot be placed in a shared folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once a message template is in the shared folder, it appears as a sent message.
This is by design.

When you store the template in a private folder, it is stored in your mail
message file (MMF). However, when the template is moved or copied to a shared
folder, it is converted from an internal MMF storage structure to a structure
that is used by shared folders. The shared folders are stored in the \FOLDERS
subdirectory on the postoffice server.

NOTE: The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation stores its shared
folders in the same manner and does not have the feature for this same reason.

When a message is stored in the MMF file, its fields are accessible. When the
message is moved to a shared folder the Federal Information Processing Systems
(FIPS) information is sealed; therefore, it becomes unavailable. As long as the
message is kept in a MMF file structure, the functionality will remain
available.

NOTE: FIPS message format is described in FIPS PUB 98. This format is a subset of
the CCITT X.400 standard for interpersonal messaging. FIPS refers to the format
used to store the raw data files. Vendor-defined (such as Microsoft) field
refers to an individual element of the message. For example, To:, From:, and
Attachment: are all vendor-defined fields.
