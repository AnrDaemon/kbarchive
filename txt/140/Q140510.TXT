SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released new protected-mode drivers for CD-ROM changers to correct
the following two problems in Windows 95:

 - TORiSAN CDR-C3G (Sanyo) CD-ROM Drives

   The second and third drives on a TORiSAN CDR-C3G (Sanyo) CD-ROM drive are not
   available in Windows 95. If you use the real-mode drivers (Torisan.sys and
   Mscdex.exe), you have full access to all three CD-ROM drives in MS-DOS. If
   you use the real-mode drivers and run Windows 95, My Computer displays drive
   letter icons for the second and third CD-ROM drives, but double-clicking the
   drive letter icons shows empty windows. If you use the protected-mode Windows
   95 drivers, the drive letter icons do not appear.


 - CD-ROM Changers Do Not Work in Windows 95

   Other generic CD-ROM changers (such as the NEC 4-disc changer) may not work
   properly in Windows 95.


CAUSE
=====

CD-ROM changers may not work in Windows 95 due to the use of non-standard IDE
specifications by the CD-ROM drive manufacturer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the updated CD-ROM changer drivers. To do so,
follow these steps:

1. Download the Cdchnger.exe file to an empty folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Cdchnger.exe file you
   downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen.

4. Shut down and restart your computer.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The updated drivers resolve the problems described in this article by allowing
ATAPI-compliant CD-ROM changers to be seen and used in Windows 95.

The Cdchnger.exe file contains the following updated files for Windows 95:

 File name     Version   Date/Time        Size    Folder installed in
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Atapchng.vxd  4.00.951  01/08/96 5:41PM  11,314  Windows\System\Iosubsys
 CdChg_Un.inf  -         04/22/96 2:07PM     525  Windows
 Cdchnger.inf  -         04/22/96 3:14PM     835  Not copied to hard disk
 Cdvsd.vxd     4.00.952  11/14/95 3:15PM  19,120  Windows\System\Iosubsys
 Scsi1hlp.vxd  4.00.953  12/21/95 3:58PM  19,213  Windows\System\Iosubsys
 Torisan3.vxd  4.00.952  11/14/95 3:15PM  11,094  Windows\System\Iosubsys
 Voltrack.vxd  4.00.952  11/14/95 3:15PM  18,518  Windows\System\Iosubsys

All of these files are updates to Windows 95 files, except for the Atapchng.vxd
file. This is a new file that is installed in the Windows\ System\Iosubsys
folder.

NOTE: If the beta CD-ROM driver Sanyo3.vxd is located in the Windows\
System\Iosubsys folder, remove it. If this file is not removed, the Torisan3.vxd
driver does not work correctly and you may experience a problem with five
(instead of three) CD-ROM drives appearing in My Computer. The last two of these
drives are duplicates of the first two actual CD-ROM drives.

How to Uninstall
----------------

1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the Cdchg_un.inf file in the Windows folder.
   Use the right mouse button to click the Cdchg_un.inf file, and then click
   Install on the menu that appears.

2. You are prompted for the Windows 95 installation CD-ROM or disks. Specify the
   appropriate path.

3. You may be prompted to replace newer files with older versions of the same
   file. To uninstall this update, choose to replace the newer files.

4. Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.
