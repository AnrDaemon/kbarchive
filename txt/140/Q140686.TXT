KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may get the following error:

   Your message file could not be located.

If you select the OK button, Mail for Windows will try to locate a MSMAIL.MMF
file. If it does not locate one, you can create a new mail message file (MMF)
and continue into Mail. However, the Mail client will be offline with the broken
network icon in the lower right corner.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when you run Schedule+ 1.0 before Mail, and you have the
StartupOffline option enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check the SCHDPLUS.INI file and see if it has the following entry:

      [Microsoft Schedule+]
      STARTUPOFFLINE=1

If the entry is there, disable it by changing the entry to STARTUPOFFLINE=0.
