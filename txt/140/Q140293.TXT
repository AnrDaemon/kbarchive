TITLE   :FIX: Missing Closing Parenthesis Acts Like a Comment
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the parenthesis symbol to enclose conditions to be evaluated and
leave off the leading parenthesis, the closing parenthesis acts like a comment
marker as if it were a double ampersand (&&). Any code that follows the
closing parenthesis is ignored when the program is executed.

Visual FoxPro should give an error message when the opening parenthesis is
missing, but in this case it does not.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the closing parenthesis has a matching opening parenthesis.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Place the following code in a .prg file:

      a = .T.
      b = .T.
      c = .F.
      IF a AND b) AND c
         WAIT WINDOW "This expression must be true."
      ENDIF

The IF statement should not evaluate to true because the variable "c" is false.
The wait window box shows up because the closing parenthesis does not allow
FoxPro to see the rest of the statement. If the closing parenthesis is taken out
or if a opening parenthesis is added, then the wait window box will not appear.
