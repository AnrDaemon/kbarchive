======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a PCL separator page which generates no
output when switching a printer to PCL mode. The default PCL separator page, in
addition to switching to PCL mode, prints the username, date, and job number on
the separator sheet. A non-printing separator page may be preferable if you have
a printer that does not autoswitch to PCL and you do not want the separator
pages generated by the default PCL.SEP separator file printed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PCL separator page is used to force a printer which supports multiple input
formats (such as Postscript, PCL, HPGL, etc.) to switch to PCL mode. For a
general PCL separator that does not generate output, start with
%SystemRoot%\System32\PSCRIPT.SEP:

   \ \H1B\L%-12345X@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=POSTSCRIPT\0

   Copy this to another file and modify it to read:

   \
   \H1B\L%-12345X@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=PCL\0

Then specify this as your separator page.

For more information on customizing separator pages please see section 6 page 13
of the "Windows NT Concept and Planning Guide" portion of Books Online (which is
included on the Windows NT CD-ROM) or see your printer's manual.

Here is the default PCL.SEP file (; = comments added):

   \ 
   \H1B\L%-12345X@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=PCL
   \H1B\L&l1T\0
   \H34
   \B\S\N\4        ;Switch to double high/double wide and print user name
   \I\4            ;Print the job id#
   \U\D\4          ;End double high/double wide and print date
   \E              ;Eject the page
