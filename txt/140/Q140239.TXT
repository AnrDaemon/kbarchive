TITLE   :SMODE Tool Does Not Affect Client for NetWare Networks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:3rdpartynet win95 kb3rdPartyNetClient

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the Novell SMODE tool to modify the search mode that is used for a
particular program, the program may not run. When this occurs, you may receive
error messages stating that an auxiliary file needed by the program cannot be
found. This behavior can occur when you are using the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is not compatible with Novell's SMODE
tool. When you run a program after using SMODE to modify the search mode for
that program, the current search mode is used instead of the search mode you
specified with SMODE.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use the Novell VLM or NETX network client instead
of the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.

STATUS
======

This behavior occurs because the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks does not
provide exactly the same functionality as the Novell VLM and NETX clients, not
because of a problem in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Novell SMODE tool is used to modify the search mode that is used when you
run a particular program. When you run the program, the search mode you
specified with SMODE overrides the current search mode.

NetWare Networks, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
