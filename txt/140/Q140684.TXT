The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you associate a script file with a Dial-Up Networking connectoid using the
Dial-Up Scripting Tool included with Microsoft Plus!, the script file may not
run when you double-click the connectoid.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Dial-Up Networking connectoid that the script
file is associated with is configured to open a terminal window after dialing.
When a connectoid is configured to open a terminal window after dialing, an
associated script file does not run.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the connectoid so that a terminal window is not opened after dialing.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the connectoid, and then click Properties
   on the menu that appears.

2. Click Configure, and then click the Options tab.

3. Click the "Bring up terminal window after dialing" check box to clear it, and
   then click OK.
