The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you remove the gateway resource from the Macintosh gateway mail server, the
gateway recipients on the downstream Macintosh servers will also be removed.
This will include addresses in personal address lists and groups. If the gateway
resource is reinstalled, the same effect will be seen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the connection installer to remove and reinstall the gateway
resource, the downstream Macintosh postoffices that use the access component
extracted from the gateway will send their normal requests to the gateway server
asking for gateway recipient updates. The gateway will respond by sending an
empty list, even when the identical gateway id and name are used.

Though it is possible to restore the gateway recipient list, the personal lists
and groups will need to be rebuilt.



Additional query words: 3.10 CNU gateway recipient resource downstream
