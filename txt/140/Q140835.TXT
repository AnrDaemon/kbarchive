======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA Server that has a local dependent APPC (LU6.2) session partnered with
multiple remote LUs shows that the wrong LU is "In Session".

This problem occurs sporadically.

CAUSE
=====

When SNA Server receives an unsolicited BIND for a dependent APPC LU, it does
not check the names in the BIND. SNA Server assumes that it is a BIND for an LU
on that LU address. However, if a local dependent APPC LU is partnered with more
than one remote LU, SNA server is in effect choosing at random which LU it
believes the BIND to be from.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server has been modified so that it does examine the LU names in an
unsolicited BIND it receives for dependent APPC LUs.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\SNASERVR.EXE
   <snaroot>\SYSTEM\TRCSERVR.EXE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
