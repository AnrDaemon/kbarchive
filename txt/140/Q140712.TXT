SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Network Monitor on your computer that has a Madge Token Ring
network interface card (NIC), Network Monitor fails to start and the following
message appears:

   The Mac driver does not support Promiscuous Mode

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable a Madge card for Network Monitor go to Control Panel\Network,
highlight the Madge card and click Configure. There will be an option in the
Madge setup called Statistics Gathering that needs to be enabled. If this option
is not available obtain an updated driver from the vendor or edit the system
registry using the following procedures:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run the Registry Editor.

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, find the key:

   \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MdgMPort2\Parameters

3. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value.

4. Add the following:

   Value Name: PromiscuousModeX
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 1

   Note: To disable promiscuous mode set the data to 0.

5. Choose OK and quit Registry Editor.

6. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

NOTE: When capturing on Token Ring (TR), the NIC on the computer running Netmon
needs to have its max frame size set to the largest tokenring frame possible
(17K), otherwise there is a possibility of dropping frames. For example, if the
NIC is configured for a maxframe size of 4500, it will drop any packet it
receives that exceeds this size.
