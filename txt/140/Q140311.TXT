 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the Value property of a Toolbar button group member to zero at run time
causes that button to become cleared regardless of whether or not it is the
selected button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Within a button group, one button and only one button should remain checked at
all times. If another button is checked, the first button becomes cleared.

The only way to clear a button that is member of a button group is to check
another member of that group.

This is the expected behavior.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, or on the File menu, click New Project (ALT, F, N).

2. Add a toolbar.

3. From the Toolbar Properties window, click the Custom property. Click the
   button to display the Toolbar Control Properties dialog box.

4. In the Toolbar Control Properties dialog box, select the Buttons tab.

5. Insert four buttons, each having a style of "Button Group."

6. Click OK to exit the Toolbar Control Properties dialog box.

7. Press F5 to run the application.

8. Click the various buttons and observe the selection behavior. Only one button
   is depressed at a time. You cannot clear a button that has been depressed.

9. Click CTRL+BREAK to halt the program.

10. Type the following code in the debug window:

          Toolbar1.Buttons(x).value=0  'where x = button # that is depressed

   The result is that all buttons are now cleared.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual Basic version 4.0 for
Windows. This problem has been corrected in the Visual Basic version 4.0a for
Windows synchronization release.
