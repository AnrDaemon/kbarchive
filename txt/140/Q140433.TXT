TITLE   :ScanDisk Err Msg: This Drive Was Compressed By a Program...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use ScanDisk to check a drive that was compressed with
DriveSpace 3 for errors, you may receive the following error message:

   This drive was compressed by a program that is not supported by ScanDisk. As
   a result, ScanDisk is unable to detect and repair compression-related errors.

If you click OK, ScanDisk checks the drive. This problem can occur even if the
drive you want to check was compressed by a program that is supported by
ScanDisk.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Dskmaint.dll file in the Windows\System folder is
the version of the file included with Windows 95, not the version included with
Microsoft Plus!.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace the Dskmaint.dll file in the Windows\System folder with the version of
the file included with Microsoft Plus!. To do so, follow these steps:

1. If ScanDisk is running, close it.

2. Type the following line at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   " ren c:\windows\system\dskmaint.dll dskmaint.xxx " (without the quotation
   marks)

3. Extract the Dskmaint.dll file from the Plus_2.cab cabinet file on the
   Microsoft Plus! CD-ROM or from disk 2 of the original Microsoft Plus! disks
   to the Windows\System folder.

   For information about using the Extract tool, type "extract" (without
   quotation marks) at a command prompt, or see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
