PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Windows 95 Setup is terminated abnormally after the hardware detection
portion of Setup has run on a computer using PCI devices, the PCI device
settings are not retained when you run Setup again and choose the Safe Recovery
option. Specifically, settings for the keyboard, mouse, and display drivers are
not retained.

CAUSE
=====

Setup does not receive device information from all the enumerated branches when
you use the Safe Recovery option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Remove the PCI devices in Device Manager, and then use the Add New Hardware
   tool in Control Panel to redetect them.

 - Run Setup again and do not use the Safe Recovery option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
