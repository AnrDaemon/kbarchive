======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a user at a TN3270 emulator requests to connect to SNA Server TN3270 Server
using a specific LU and gives the lower-case version of the LU name, the
emulator fails to connect.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server LUA library is case-sensitive, and therefore does not accept
lower-case LU names.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft corrected this problem. The fix causes all incoming names to be
converted to upper case.

Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:

   <TN3270>\I386\SYMBOLS\EXE\TN3SERVR.DBG
   <TN3270>\I386\ TN3SERVR.EXE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
