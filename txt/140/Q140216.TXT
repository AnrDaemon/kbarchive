-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia for Windows, 1996 edition on
Windows 3.0 or later, you receive the following error message:

   Call to Undefined Dynalink

This message appears when you attempt to access the following options:

 - Word Processor in Encarta (by pressing CTRL+W)
 - File, Open in Microsoft Write
 - File, Run, Browse from Program Manager

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by duplicate versions of Commdlg.dll (one in the
Windows folder and one in Windows\System folder).

This problem also occurs when there is an incorrect or outdated dynamic link
library (.DLL) on the system. When the Encarta Encyclopedia is installed, it may
incorrectly update Commdlg.dll and cause this error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Problem: Duplicate Versions of Commdlg.dll
------------------------------------------

If you have duplicate versions of Commdlg.dll, search the entire drive for
Commdlg.dll and remove the duplicate file(s).

Problem: Incorrect or Outdated Dynamic Link Library (.DLL)
----------------------------------------------------------

If you have an incorrect or outdated dynamic link library (.DLL) on the system,
expand and overwrite the existing Commdlg.dll, located in the Windows System
folder, with the Commdlg.dll file from the original Windows disks (located on
disk 4 of both the 1.44-MB 3.5-inch disk set and the 1.2-MB 5.25-inch disk
set).

Exit Windows, and do this at the MS-DOS command prompt by typing the following

   expand [drive1]:\commdlg.dl_ c:\windows\system\commdlg.dll

where [drive1] is the drive designating the location of the Windows disk (usually
a or b), and c:\windows is the location of Windows. Change the command
appropriately if your installation of Windows is located elsewhere.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Encarta overwrites Commdlg.dll it will be dated 6/5/95 with a size of 22,096
bytes. In Windows 3.1, Commdlg.dll should be dated 3/10/92 with a size of 89,248
bytes. In Windows for Workgroups 3.11, it should be dated 11/1/93 with a size of
97,936 bytes.

The manual installation batch file, Manual96.bat, included on the Encarta CD-ROM,
incorrectly overwrites the Commdlg.dll file used by Windows. The regular Encarta
96 Setup program avoids this problem by checking version numbers when deciding
whether or not to overwrite. However, if the existing version of Commdlg.dll is
older than version 3.10, Setup will attempt to update it, causing the error
specified above.
