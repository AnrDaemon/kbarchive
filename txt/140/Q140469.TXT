TITLE   :Err Msg: CHKDSK Is Correcting a Minor Error in File 5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When either CHKDSK or AUTOCHK is running, you receive the following error
message:

   CHKDSK is correcting a minor error in file 5

The "minor error" that CHKDSK or AUTOCHK is reporting is usually because a
directory entry for a file does not match the MFT entry for the file with
respect to an attribute like the file size or date/time stamp. "File 5" refers
to the root directory of the partition and not a specific file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this error occurs from a mounted volume, then you are getting the error
because the file system takes time updating the duplicated information in the
directory entry. Until that happens it does not match the information stored
with the file record.

This error message will occur often with the pagefile since it is always open and
may conflict with the duplicated MFT if the system was not shutdown normally.

If this problem happens consistently, the hardware should be checked for
inconsistencies.
