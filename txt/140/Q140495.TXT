SUMMARY
=======

In regard to future development, Microsoft Corporation does not plan to release
any new versions of ODBC components for 16-bit Windows operating systems. For
all outstanding issues with ODBC components that occur on 16- bit platforms, the
following procedure for problem resolution will occur:

1. Microsoft Product Support Services will assist customers with identifying and
   isolating problems they are having with ODBC 16-bit components.

2. If Microsoft Corporation identifies a problem to be isolated within an ODBC
   16-bit component, Microsoft will attempt to replicate the problem behavior
   with the latest released versions of ODBC 32-bit components.

3. If Microsoft Corporation identifies a problem to be isolated within an ODBC
   32-bit component, it will proceed to resolve that issue in the 32- bit
   component. Upon request of the customer, Microsoft will attempt within the
   best of its resources to provide customers with workarounds within the 16-bit
   ODBC environment, but please note that the recommended resolution for all
   problems identified in a 16-bit ODBC component which are resolved in a 32-bit
   ODBC component will be to migrate to the 32-bit ODBC component.
