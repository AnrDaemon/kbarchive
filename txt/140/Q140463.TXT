SUMMARY

When an SNMP GET or WALK request with more than 32 elements is received by the
SNMP Service on a Windows NT machine, the service will hang. Using Performance

sitting at 90% - 100% of user time.

The machine will continue to operate as a server, but no further SNMP requests
will be processed.

==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
