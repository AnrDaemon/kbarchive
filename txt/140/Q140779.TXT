SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT 3.5x Resource Kit states on page 632 of Volume 1 that you can
change the Registry setting for "PowerdownAfterShutdown" so that a new entry -
"Shutdown and Power off" - appears on the WinLogon menu.


If you change this entry and select the new option from the menu, the machine
performs a "Shutdown and Restart" and does not power off the system. This occurs
even if the machines BIOS supports Plug and Play power down options such as the
ones in Win95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OEM would have to write their own HAL to support this option. Setting the
registry value enables the system to send the HAL a power down request. The x86
MS supplied HALs do not know what to do with the request. (we do not call BIOS
at anytime after initial boot). It is intended for an OEM who has supplied a HAL
which can support the power down request.

Additional query words: prodnt power off
