The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to separate the Visual SourceSafe data directory from
the server installation location for both standalone and integration
applications of Visual SourceSafe.

As an alternative, if you have a stand-alone application, you can use the
technique described in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q123471 How to Change the Data Directory Location

MORE INFORMATION
================

This solution doesn't work if a client machine has already run the client setup
program for integration. To overcome this, you may need to run Setup with the
Remove All option.

The simplest way to do this is with a Custom installation to the desired server.
Select only "Create Sourcesafe database" from the installation options. The
Srcsafe.ini on the original server installation should be modified to a single
line as follows :

         #include \\mycomputer\myshare\SRCSAFE.INI
            ;where \\mycomputer\myshare is the desired new location for
            ;the DATA.

If you have existing Visual SourceSafe 4.0 Data, your files may be safely moved
to the new locations using the drag and drop or copy functions. This move should
include the Data directories, the user directories, the temp directory, and the
Users.txt file.

With this modification, all installations pointing to the original installation
will be properly routed to the new data location.

NOTE: The Srcsafe.ini string of #includes is not limited to two, as in this
example, but using a long series of #include should be discouraged.
