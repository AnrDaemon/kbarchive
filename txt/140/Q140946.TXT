TITLE   :XADM: Microsoft Mail Interchange Hang During DirSync
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a normal Directory Synchronization (DirSync) cycle, the Microsoft Mail
Interchange (MSMI) hangs on some, but not all, outgoing messages created by the
Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization Service (DXA) when Microsoft
Exchange is acting as the DirSync Server. This is normally only seen in
organizations with large Global Address Lists (GALs) and is only seen on
multi-processor machines running the MSMI Service.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the DXA compresses all outgoing DirSync messages. Microsoft Mail
postoffices do not understand this compressed file so it is necessary for the
MSMI to decompress it prior to sending to any Microsoft Mail postoffice. This
code was not optimized for multi-processor machines.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
