TITLE   :XCLN: Distribution List in To: Field Not Bold in Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive a message that was sent to a Microsoft Exchange Distribution
List, the name of the Distribution List is not bold in the To: field. If you
double-click the Distribution List name in the To: field, it brings up the
details of the Distribution List and the Distribution List name is bold in the
To: field.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To improve the performance of the Microsoft Exchange clients, the member list of
a Distribution List is not loaded into memory when the message is first opened.
Only the Display Name of the Distribution List is used in the To: field. When
you double-click the Distribution List name, the member list of the Distribution
List is loaded from the address book and displayed. Once this procedure is done,
the client has confirmed that the name is a valid Distribution List name, so it
displays the Distribution List name in bold, which is the default format to
display a Distribution List name in Microsoft Exchange.


Additional query words: highlight group name
