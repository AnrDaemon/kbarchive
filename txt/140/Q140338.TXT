TITLE   :XADM: DS Crashes With Dr. Watson In Details.c
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to obtain details of a queued message in the Microsoft Exchange
Message Transfer Agent (MTA) property page, using the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program, the Microsoft Exchange Directory service (DS) may crash
with a Dr. Watson error. If Microsoft Exchange and Windows NT symbols are
installed, the Dr. Watson dump will show the crash in Details.c.

CAUSE
=====

The call made to the DS to obtain the details of the message expects a certain
number of attributes to be returned. In some cases, these return values can be
pulled from bad memory. This causes the DS to crash.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
