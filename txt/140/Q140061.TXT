TITLE   :SMS Administrator Not Updating After SQL Server Name Change
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the SQL Server name was changed after the installation of an SMS site, SMS
Administrator appears to connect to the new SQL server name, but does not show
changes made to the SQL database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMS Event Detail log shows the following:

      EventID: 356
      Site Hierarchy Manager [SMS Build 600]: Site Hierarchy Manager is not
      functional. Unable to make connection to SQL Server Old_SQL_Server_Name.

Changing the SQL login parameters at the "Microsoft SMS Administrator Login"
screen only affects the SMS administrator and not the SQL login account or the
SMS services. SMS Setup needs to be run to set the new SQL Server Name to work
with SMS services.

RESOLUTION
==========

The SQL Server name must be updated in two locations:

 - At the SMS Administrator login

 - In the Operations/SMS Database dialog of the SMS Setup program.

To do this:

1. Run Setup

2. Click on Operations, then SMS Database

3. Update the SQL Server Name field

4. Start SMS Administrator and update the SQL Server Name field at the login
   screen.
