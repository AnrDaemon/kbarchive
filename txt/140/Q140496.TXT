In the RELNOTE2.WRI file that is shipped with the ODBC Software Development
Kit (SDK) 2.10b, there is an indication that the descriptor
SQL_COLUMN_UPDATABLE describes the updatability of the base column, not the
result set. This is indicated in the Problems and Information section for
SQLColAttributes(). This section also indicates that the description of
SQL_COLUMN_UPDATABLE in the SQLColAttributes section of the ODBC 2.0
"Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide" should be changed to indicate that
this descriptor describes the updatability of the base column.

Both of the above statements in the RELNOTE2.WRI are incorrect. The
definition in the ODBC 2.0 "Programmer's Reference" remains as is,
indicating that SQL_COLUMN_UPDATABLE describes the updatability of the
column in the result set which may be different from the updatability of
the column in its base table. It may be possible, in future releases of the
ODBC API specification, that a column will be added in the SQLColumns
result set that indicates the updatability of the column in its base table.
If you want to express your opinion regarding whether or not this should be
done or how it should or should not be implemented, please feel free to
