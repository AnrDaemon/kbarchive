PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:3.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro version 3.0, every time you open the Data Environment window of
a form and move the tables around or resize the Data Environment window, you
lose GDI resources that cannot be recovered until you exit out of Visual FoxPro.
After you do this several times, the GDI resources get so low that other
programs can't run or Visual FoxPro may quit.

WORKAROUND
==========

Restart Visual FoxPro to recover all system resources. Refrain from moving
tables around in the Data Environment of the form and refrain from resizing the
Data Environment window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro
version 3.0b.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem also occurs in the Database Designer as described in the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

--------------------------

1. Ensure that the Windows 95 System resource meter is installed on your system.
   In Windows 95, click the Start button, click Programs, click Accessories,

   icon will appear on the task bar next to the clock.

2. Open Testdata.dbc located in the Vfp\Samples\Data directory.

3. Create a new Form.

4. Check GDI Resources by right-clicking the resource meter icon and then
   clicking Details.

5. Open the Data Environment for the form, and add all the tables from
   Testdata.dbc.

6. Resize the Data Environment window, and move the tables around within the
   Data Environment window.

7. Close the Data Environment, and then close and save the form

8. Check the GDI Resources to see that you have lost anywhere from 1% to 3% of
   the available resources.

9. Open the form and the Data Environment. Repeat steps 6 through 8. Note that
   you continue to lose 1% to 3% of the GDI Resource each time you open and
   close the form.
