======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have two or more network adapters in your computer and you are using
Dial-Up Networking to connect to a network using the TCP/IP protocol, you may
not be assigned an IP address and may not be able to use a static IP address.
When this occurs, running Winipcfg.exe shows an IP address and subnet mask of
0.0.0.0, even though you are connected with the TCP/IP protocol.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when you have two or more network adapters installed with
TCP/IP bound to each, and you have TCP/IP bound to the Dial-Up Networking
adapter.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
   Network.

2. Click one of the network adapters. (NOTE: Do not click the Dial-Up Networking
   adapter.)

3. Click Properties.

4. On the Bindings tab, click the TCP/IP check box to clear it, and then click
   OK.

5. If you have more than two network adapters, repeat steps 2-4 until TCP/IP is
   bound to only one network adapter and the Dial-Up Networking adapter.

6. Click OK until you return to Control Panel. When you are prompted to restart
   your computer, do so.


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
