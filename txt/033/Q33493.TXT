SUMMARY
=======

Ventura Publisher version 1.1 uses the GEM operating system as its own windowing
environment. This operating system takes over port usage in some cases. This
problem has also been reported with Ventura Publisher version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using a Microsoft Mouse with a serial interface, if you follow the steps
below, your mouse pointer becomes frozen on the screen because Windows has no
way of reinitializing the port:

1. Execute Ventura from Windows.

2. Exit Ventura to the MS-DOS Executive.

At the beginning of the Ventura documentation is the note recommending that if
you use Ventura version 1.1 with Windows, you should use a mouse with a bus
interface.

This information applies to Microsoft Windows 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, and 3.0a.
This does not apply to later versions of Windows.
