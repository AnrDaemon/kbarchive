SUMMARY
=======

When some programs exit, or shell out to MS-DOS, they need to reload the command
interpreter, COMMAND.COM. To make the process of reloading the command
interpreter more efficient, you can place COMMAND.COM on a RAMDrive. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. In your AUTOEXEC.BAT batch file, copy the file COMMAND.COM to the RAMDrive.

2. Set the COMSPEC environment variable to point to the copy of COMMAND.COM on
   the RAMDrive.

3. Set the PATH environment variable to include COMMAND.COM's location on the
   RAMDrive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of copying COMMAND.COM to a RAMDrive called E:

   COPY C:\COMMAND.COM E:\ 
   SET COMSPEC=E:\COMMAND.COM
   SET PATH=E:\;...  <---  Fill in the rest of your PATH
