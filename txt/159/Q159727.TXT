PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply a service pack, you may receive the following error message with
the path to the file in question:

   An error has occurred.

   The file drive_letter:\<winnt>\..... was not copied correctly or was not
   a valid Windows NT image.

You may continue by ignoring the error, retrying the operation, or exiting Setup.
If you choose to ignore the error, Setup may not be able to completely and/or
correctly install the software. If Ignore is selected, the file may copy but may
still be corrupted. If you choose to exit Setup, you will have to repeat the
setup process from the beginning.

CAUSE
=====

The file may actually be corrupted, even though the file size matches what it
should be.

This corruption may be because the self extraction process did not extract the
file properly from the compressed service pack download, or the self- extracting
service pack file itself may be corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Retry the self-extraction process in a different directory, or download the
service pack again.
