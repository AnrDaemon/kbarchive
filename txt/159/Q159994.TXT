KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A file lock may not appear to be free on a Macintosh computer attached to a MAC
Volume when the following occurs:

1. A personal computer-based application locks a record in the file on a
   Macintosh Volume.

2. The Macintosh attempts to lock the same record and gets a return code
   indicating that the record is already locked.

3. The personal computer-based application releases its lock on the record.

4. The record still appears to be locked when viewed from the Macintosh even
   though it is not locked.

CAUSE
=====

The cached information for the lock in Services for Macintosh is not cleared out
when the personal computer lock is removed.


STATUS
======

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
