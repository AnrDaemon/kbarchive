KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 97 World Atlas for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In World Atlas, you cannot attach a long note to a Pushpin. The only available
options for annotating Pushpins are Name Only and Balloon For Short Note.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Encarta World Atlas Help file incorrectly states that you can "Annotate your
Pushpin with a short or long note."

Although you can annotate Pushpins that you create in Microsoft Automap Streets
Plus or Microsoft Automap Trip Planner with long notes, this behavior is not
available in Pushpins created in Encarta World Atlas.

Additional query words: multi media multimedia multi-media mmtitles
