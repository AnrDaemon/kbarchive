SUMMARY
=======

In steps 3 and 4 of the instructions on how "To copy a class from one class
library to another," the "Managing Classes With The Class Browser" Help topic in
the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Help file incorrectly states the following:

   Step 3 "In the source class library, select the class you want to copy, and
   then drag the class icon picture located above the class list to the class
   icon picture in the destination library. The cursor appears with a plus sign
   when you are over the destination class icon."

   Step 4 "In the dialog box that opens, choose Yes to move the class, No to copy
   the class, or Cancel to prevent changes to either library."

MORE INFORMATION
================

To copy a class from one class library to another using the Class Browser, hold
down the Control key while dragging the class from the source instance of the
Class Browser to the other. A dialog box does not appear as indicated in step 4
above. The Status Bar indicates that the class is being copied. If the Control
key is not held down, the Status Bar indicates that the class is being moved.

This also applies to the "To copy multiple classes from one class library file to
another" Help topic.
