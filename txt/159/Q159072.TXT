TITLE   :An Account That Still Has System Access May Be Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If LsarRemoveAccountRights is used to remove all privileges from an account, and
no changes were made to the account's system access, the account will be
deleted. This deletion will occur even if the account still has system access.
The account should only be deleted if there are no privileges and the account
has no system access.

CAUSE
=====

LsarRemoveAccountRights is not checking for system access unless system access
is changed. This will result in LsarRemoveAccountRights treating the account as
if it has no system access. Therefore, if all privileges are removed, the
account will be deleted.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
