SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to insert IPX/SPX options using the Msbatch.inf file
for batch installations of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [Network] section to include the following
line:

   Protocols=NWLINK  ; other protocols can be inserted here also

Also, add the following section and parameters as needed:

   [NWLINK]
   Frame_Type=value
   NetBIOS=value
   Cachesize=value
   Maxconnect=value
   Maxsockets=value
   Forceeven=value

Frame_Type values:

0=802.3
1=802.2
2=Ethernet II
4=Auto
5=Token ring
6=Token ring SNAP

NetBIOS values:

0=Do not install NetBIOS support over IPX/SPX
1=Install NetBIOS support over IPX/SPX

Cachesize values (Source Routing):

0=Off
16=16 entry cache (recommended)
32=32 entry cache
64=64 entry cache

Maxconnect values (maximum connections):

Allowable values are 1-128. If you do not want a value set for this parameter, do
not include it in the section.

Maxsockets values (maximum sockets):

Allowable values are 2-255. If you do not want a value set for this parameter, do
not include it in the section.

Forceeven values:

0=No ; Do not force even-length packets
1=Yes ; Force even-length packets

Additional Information
----------------------

If for some reason the frame_type setting in the Msbatch.inf file does not take
effect, and a certain frame type is required, modify the Nettrans.inf file to
force the frame type.

To accomplish this, find the following line in the [NWLINK.ndi.reg] section of
the Nettrans.inf file:

   HKR,Ndi\params\Frame_Type,default,,4

The number at the end of the line is the default for the frame type. Because 4 is
the default, it defaults to Auto.

When you use the Msbatch.inf file, you force the frame type for a specific
network adapter or configuration. When enumeration takes place and a new network
adapter is found, the information in the Nettrans.inf file is used.
