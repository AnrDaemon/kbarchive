TITLE   :DIR Command to NetWare Server Using GSNW Results in Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a NetWare server using the Windows NT Gateway Services for
NetWare (GSNW), if you attempt to use the DIR command in a directory on the
NetWare server, you may receive the following error message:

   File not found

If you make a direct connection to the NetWare server (without using GSNW), this
problem does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when a large number of files exist in the directory on the
NetWare server for which the DIR command is being used.


RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, use one of the following methods:

 - Connect to the NetWare server directly, without using GSNW.

 - Divide the directory on the NetWare server into smaller directories with
   fewer files.
