TITLE   :Mouse Cursor Freezes or Fails with Microsoft IntelliMouse
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardwarekbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft IntelliMouse mouse cursor may freeze or the mouse control
functions may begin to fail. You must restart your computer to regain control of
your mouse.

CAUSE
=====

The I8042prt device driver misinterprets a valid data packet from the mouse as a
self-test return code and waits for additional self-test data. Since this same
data packet can be a valid data stream for IntelliMouse, the device driver
becomes unstable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
