TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 RAS Not Releasing Static IP Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 RAS clients fail to be assigned an IP address from the RAS
server's static address pool. However, there appear to be IP addresses, which
should be available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 RAS server assigns static IP addresses from a pool to incoming
clients, and when they hang up, the addresses are not released.

During regular use, it is observed that, on client hang-up, the IP address
assigned to the client is not returned to the IP address pool. This problem is
inconsistent and may happen about once in every 10 to 20 connections. The
address remains in the routing table. Trying to ping the "lost" IP address
results in a "Hardware error" message.

If manually removing the address from the routing table (route delete), it will
still not be reused by RAS. Stopping and starting the Remote Access Service does
not restore the "lost" addresses to the address pool.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.00. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.00. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
