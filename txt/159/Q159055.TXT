TITLE   :NTBACKUP Always Reports Time as PM in Backup.log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use NTBACKUP in Windows NT Server version 4.0 and Windows NT
Workstation version 4.0, and you set the clock to use twenty-four hour time,
there is an incorrect PM setting appended to the operation in the Backup.log
file. Twenty-four hour time does not use or need AM or PM settings and should
not be applied to any events that use this measurement of time.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been fixed in Service Pack 2 for Windows NT Server and
Workstation version 4.0
