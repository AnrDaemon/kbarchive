PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SCSI specification reassign blocks command is set to 0x01 instead of 0x04.
You may not experience specific problems associated with this.


CAUSE
=====

The second sentence of the first paragraph of section 9.2.10 (reassign blocks
command) of the SCSI Specification X3T9.2/375R revision 10K states:

   The defect list length is equal to four times the number of defect
   descriptors and does not include the defect list length header.

Windows NT 3.51 erroneously multiplies this field by 1 instead of 4.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.

A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression tested and
may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
