SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to print to a network printer in Windows 95, the following
error message may be displayed

segment and actual address in which the stack fault occurred.

provider on the computer that the network printer is connected to are unable to
properly communicate with each other. The problem is most likely to occur when
the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks and the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks are both installed on your computer, although the problem is not
network-related.


RESOLUTION

STATUS
======
