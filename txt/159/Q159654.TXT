KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you migrate a Traditional Chinese Microsoft Mail 3.5 postoffice to
Microsoft Exchange Server, some Chinese characters in the resulting public
folder may be damaged.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the Msfs32.dll file that is included with U.S.
Microsoft Exchange Server is located in the Winnt\System32 folder when you
migrate the postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, extract the Msfs32.dll file from the
Traditional Chinese Microsoft Exchange Client CD-ROM, and then copy the file to
your Winnt\System32 folder before you migrate the postoffice. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. Rename the Msfs32.dll file in your Winnt\System32 folder to Msfs32.xxx.

2. Extract the Msfs32.dll file from the Cht\Winnt\I386 folder on the Traditional
   Chinese Microsoft Exchange Client CD-ROM to your Winnt\System32 folder. To do
   so, type a command similar to the following at a command prompt, and then
   press ENTER:

   extract /l c:\winnt\system32 exchng4.cab msfs32.dll
