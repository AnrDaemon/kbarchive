KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server has been modified to use 7-bit Japanese Industry
Standards (JIS, the code set for Japanese characters) in the MIME/JIS
configuration. For more information about this fix, please see the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q169678 XADM: IMS and IS Use Quoted-Printable Encoding For MIME/JIS

However, Quoted-Printable encoding is still used in messages that contain both
double-byte character set (DBCS) and single-byte character set (SBCS)
characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
