TITLE   :XCLN: Profgen.exe Fails to Replace MailBoxName
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create profiles using Profgen.exe with the -U switch or with
UpdateMailboxName=1 in Profgen.ini, the MailboxName= entry in the Default.prf
file is updated with the Current Login ID; however, the profile contains the
MailboxName originally specified in Default.prf instead of the Current Login ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be resolved by obtaining the latest version of Profgen.exe from
the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, version 1.0. You will need to obtain the
updated version of Profgen.exe if the properties of your Profgen.exe file are:

   Size: 80,272 KB
   Date: 5/17/96

The newer version of Profgen.exe has the following properties:

   Size: 80,752 KB
   Date: 8/13/96

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Roving User Profile Generation Program, Profgen.exe, is
an unsupported program that simplifies the creation of Microsoft Exchange
Profiles. It works in conjunction with the Automatic Profile Generator program
(Newprof.exe) to create profiles.

Profgen.exe can be used to overwrite the MailBoxName= entry in the Default.prf
file with the current logged in User ID. This can be done by running Profgen.exe
with the -U switch or changing the UpdateMailboxName= entry in the the [PROFGEN]
section of the Profgen.ini file to a value of 0. If no command line options are
specified, Profgen.exe will utilize the Profgen.ini.

After modifying Default.prf, Profgen.exe copies Default.prf to Profgen.tmp.
Profgen.tmp is then used with Newprof.exe to create the profile.

The older version of Profgen.exe modifies the MailboxName= entry after copying
Default.prf to Profgen.tmp. Thus, the newly created profile will not be updated,
but the Default.prf will.

More information on Profgen.exe can be found in the "Microsoft Exchange Roving
User Profile Generation Program (Profgen.exe)" white paper located on the
Microsoft TechNet compact disc and at
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/tnorder.htm.
