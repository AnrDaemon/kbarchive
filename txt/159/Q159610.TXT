-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a computer listed in the Invcolcl.txt file cannot be located on the network
by the Systems Management Server Windows NT Inventory File Collector Service,
Pollinv.exe, the following will occur:

 - The service will appear to stop responding when trying to locate that
   computer. It will not log anything further in the Invcolcl.log log file.

 - If the service is then restarted manually, or comes to the beginning of its
   next watchdog cycle (the default is 24 hours), then an access violation (AV)
   error will occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the nonexistent computer from the list of
computers to poll in the Invcolcl.txt file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2, the Systems Management Server Resource Kit 1.2, and the Backoffice
Resource Kit version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
