PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) terminates unexpectedly with
an event similar to the following (as viewed in the Application Event Log):

   Event Id: 9405
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Type: Error
   Category: Field Engineering
   Description:
   An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to terminate. Error:
   Exception c0000005 occurred at Address 0x02163E04. (16)

This failure may be coincident with the addition of a new Directory Replication
Connector, or at MTA startup.

CAUSE
=====

The MTA code that generates the text file GWART0.MTA did not use a data
structure large enough to accommodate the routing information obtained through
directory replication.

WORKAROUND
==========

There is no workaround for this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
