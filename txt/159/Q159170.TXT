TITLE   :XADM: Calling HRBackupGetDatabaseNames Returns Invalid Parameter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 3 (SP3), using the
HRBackupGetDatabaseNames call from the Microsoft Exchange Software Developers
Kit (SDK) may stop with the following error message:

   Return Code: 0x57 - invalid parameter

CAUSE
=====

A new version of Edbbcli.dll was included in Service Pack 3 to fix a problem
when using Windows NT4.0 to remotely backup a computer that is running both
Microsoft Exchange Server and Windows NT 3.51.

Producing this fix introduced an error in the conversion of an ASCII string to
uni-code. NTBackup uses uni-code directly and this error causes the call to
HRBackupGetDatabaseNames to be handled incorrectly and return the "invalid
parameter."


WORKAROUND
==========

Replace the SP3 version of Edbbcli.dll in the <winntdir>\System32
directory with the version shipped in Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 2
or Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0a.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below. Edbbcli.dll was updated to properly handle the
ASCII to uni-code conversion.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word

MORE INFORMATION

Cheyenne's Exchange Database Agent software after applying Microsoft Exchange
Server Service Pack 3.
