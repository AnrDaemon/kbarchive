TITLE   :XFOR: Extra Carriage Return in Dir-Sync Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A dir-sync message coming from the Microsoft Exchange Server Directory
Synchronization Agent (DXA) has an extra carriage return (CR) at the end of each
dir-sync transaction. The dir-sync message's attachment may look similar to the
following:

   A Shannon BoydPCM:ABC/NYC/SBOYD

   A Paul Canniff PCM:ABC/NYC/PCANNIFF

   D Stephanie ConroyPCM:ABC/NYC/SCONROY

And so on.

CAUSE
=====

There are three formats for the transactions in dir-sync messages.

 - inattachment: the transactions are sent in a separate attachment.

 - inbody: the transactions are sent in the body of the message.

 - internal: the transactions are sent in MSMail GLB format.

An error in the logic of the DXA causes an extra CR to be placed at the end of
each transaction if the transactions are sent inattachment. The extra CR is not
placed at the end of the transaction if the format of the transactions is either
inbody or internal.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Configure to send and receive dir-sync messages inbody or internal.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
