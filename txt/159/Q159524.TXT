TITLE   :SMS: Color Option Causes Folder Name Display Problems w/PCMMAC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Highlight Color option on a Macintosh is set to 'black-white,' Package
Command Manager for the Macintosh (PCMMAC) will have problems displaying the
folder names in the left pane of the Package Command Manager (PCM) window.

You may observe any of the following problems:

 - When PCMMAC initially loads, the default selection shows only a black bar for
   the folder name.

 - The name of the active folder becomes blank when the next folder is selected
   (this problem may also be seen by clicking on the right pane of the PCM
   window).

 - Hiding and restoring the PCM window causes the blank names to be restored,
   but the active folder remains black.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the highlight color to something other than
'black-white.' This setting can be changed in the Color Control Panel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
