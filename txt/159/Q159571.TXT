======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SQL Server versions 6.0, 6.5 
 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.5 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an ODBC application uses SQLCancel instead of SQLFreeStmt to close an ODBC
cursor after some data has been processed, the ODBC cursor library version 2.5
may generate a memory leak.

A Visual Basic 4.0 application may encounter this problem if the application uses
the Requery method of an RDO Resultset. The ReQuery method internally invokes
SQLCancel instead of SQLFreeStmt and SQL_CLOSE to close the statement handle,
before binding the parameters and results.

CAUSE
=====

An ODBC application should only call SQLCancel when dealing with asynchronous
processing. ODBC applications should always use SQLFreeStmt and SQL_CLOSE rather
than SQLCancel to close the statement handle.

For more information on how to use SQLCancel, please refer to Microsoft ODBC 2.0
Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Visual Basic application can call the Close and OpenRecordset methods instead
of ReQuery. The Close method invokes SQLFreeStmt and SQL_CLOSE to close the
statement handle.
