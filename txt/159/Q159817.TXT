KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbusage kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You receive one of the following error messages when you attempt to insert or
attach a database by using an ODBC driver and MSQuery.

Case 1: When you attempt to insert a database into a Word document, you receive
the following error message:

   Function Sequence Error.

When you click Details, you receive the following error message:

   ODBC Error: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Function sequence error.
   SQL State: S1010
   Return Code: SQL_ERROR

When you click OK, you receive the following error message:

   Word could not replace the selection with the specified database.

Case 2: When you attempt to attach the database from the Mail Merge Helper, you
receive the following error message:

   Word could not merge the main document with the data source because the data
   records were empty or no data records matched your query options.

CAUSE
=====

The MSQuery SQL string exceeds 255 characters. Word truncates the SQL query
string at 255 characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem for both cases mentioned in the "Symptoms" section,
use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Do Not Use MSQuery to Filter the Database
---------------------------------------------------

Click No when you receive the following message while inserting or opening a
database, and then use the Filter or Sort query options:

   Word detected Microsoft Query on your system. Would you like to edit
   <filename> using Microsoft Query?

Method 2: Do Not Use Word to Query the Data Set
-----------------------------------------------

Create the query or recordsets in the database application, save your query
results, and then from Word, insert or attach this data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
