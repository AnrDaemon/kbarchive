======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Paint, the toolbar or color palette may not be visible even
though you have chosen the corresponding command on the View menu. Removing and
reinstalling Paint does not correct the problem.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you move the toolbar or color palette so that it
appears in a separate window, and then either of the following events occurs:

 - You move the toolbar or color palette so that it is hidden behind the Windows
   95 taskbar.

 - You move the toolbar or color palette to the bottom or right edge of the
   screen and then configure Windows 95 to use a lower resolution. When you do
   so, the toolbar or color palette may be located on an area of the desktop
   that is not visible.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:

 - Move the taskbar to a different location. If the toolbar or color palette is
   then visible, move the toolbar or color palette to a different location and
   then move the taskbar back to its original location.

 - Configure Windows 95 to use the highest resolution supported by your display
   adapter and monitor. To configure Windows 95 to use a higher resolution,
   double-click Display in Control Panel, click the Settings tab, and then move
   the Desktop Area slider to the right.

   If the toolbar or color palette is then visible, move the toolbar or color
   palette to a different location and then configure Windows 95 to use the
   original resolution. To prevent the behavior from happening again when you
   return to the original resolution, move the toolbar or color palette to the
   upper left corner of the screen or move it so that it does not appear in a
   separate window. After you return to the original resolution, you can move
   the toolbar or color palette to the location you want.

 - WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
   may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
   problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
   Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

   NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys
   And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
   should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
   before you edit the registry.

   If the toolbar is not visible when you are using Paint, delete the Floating
   value under the following registry key:

   Hkey_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\
   Paint\General-Bar3

   If the color palette is not visible when you are using Paint, delete the
   Floating value under the following registry key:

   Hkey_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\
   Paint\General-Bar4

   Deleting the appropriate registry value causes the toolbar or color palette to
   appear in the Paint window instead of appearing as a separate window. You can
   then move the toolbar or color palette to the location you want.
