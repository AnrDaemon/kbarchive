TITLE   :XCLN: Can't Install SP2 on Windows NT w/out Admin Privileges
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup program for the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, you
may see the following error message can occur:

   You currently don't have permission to install files to your system
   directory. Consult your System Administrator for assistance.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Client Setup.exe checks to see if the user currently logged on has
administrator privileges. This is done because sufficient privileges are needed
to overwrite system files (in this case Mapi32.dll) on Windows NT when using an
NTFS partition. If the currently logged on user does not have administrator
privileges, the message is displayed and Setup cancels.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Have someone with administrator privileges install Exchange Windows NT client
   Service Pack 2 (SP2).
