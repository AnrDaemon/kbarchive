TITLE   :RPC over NetBIOS Programs Can't Call from Server to RAS Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbRPC kbSDKPlatform kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Remote Access Service (RAS) client dials in to a RAS server using NetBEUI as
the protocol. If the RAS server is configured to allow access to the remote
network, RPC applications initiated at the RAS server cannot connect back to the
RAS client. The RAS server may hang up the line, and log Event 20014.

One such application is the Microsoft Exchange Dynamic RAS Connector.

CAUSE
=====

When a network application is run on a RAS server, and it tries to connect to a
RAS client, if access to the entire network is enabled, then the network traffic
is processed by the RAS NetBIOS gateway. RPC applications have a problem
interacting with the RAS NetBIOS gateway over NetBIOS/NetBEUI.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.00 This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: In order to have the RAS server NetBIOS gateway proxy for client NetBIOS
application names, such as those registered by the Microsoft Exchange Server MTA
(Mail Transfer Agent), you must set the following registry parameter to 2.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
\SYSTEM
\CurrentControlSet
\Services
\RemoteAccess
\Parameters
\NetBiosGateway
\RemoteListen

   Value Type: REG_DWORD
   Default: 1 (change to 2)
