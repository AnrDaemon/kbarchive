TITLE   :MS Phone May Use Speaker Even Though Handset Is Off the Hook
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Phone, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to prevent Microsoft Phone version 1.0 from using the speaker
phone to place a call by picking up the handset on your telephone before the
call is placed, Microsoft Phone may still use the speaker phone to place the
call.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the voice modem installed in your computer is unable
to accurately detect the state of the handset. Some voice modems are unable to
determine whether the handset is off the hook when a modem connection has not
been established.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - When you want to use the handset on your telephone instead of the speaker
   phone, pick up the handset after Microsoft Phone places the call instead of
   before.

 - Contact the modem's manufacturer to inquire about a possible firmware upgrade
   that allows you to pick up the handset before Microsoft Phone places the
   call.
