TITLE   :Saving File to Windows NT 3.51 Server Loses Long File Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbnetwork msnets appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you open a file in Microsoft Excel version 5.0c or Microsoft Word version 6.0
using the short file name on a Windows NT 3.51 server, if the file has a long
file name the long file name is lost when you save the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs only when you save a file to a Windows NT 3.51 server.

Microsoft Excel and Word save the file in a temporary file, delete the original
file, and rename the temporary file to the original name. Because Microsoft
Excel 5.0c and Word 6.0 are not aware of the long file names, they use short
names in this process. Therefore, the original long file name is lost after the
delete and rename sequence.
