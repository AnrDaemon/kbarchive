The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can run the MS-DOS or Windows NT External.exe (referred to as "MTA" in this
article from here on) across a WAN to deliver mail from one postoffice to
another. Depending on the speed of the WAN connection, your configuration may or
may not be supported by Microsoft Technical Support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the speed of the WAN is less than 64 KB, there will need to be an MTA at both
ends of the WAN connection and the WANDrives parameter will need to be used.
Please refer to chapter 12 in the "Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide" for
more information on the WANDrives parameter.

If the speed of the WAN is less than 32 KB, there may be intermittent mail
failures, even with an MTA at each end of the connnection. This will be because
of the inherent limitations of the MS Mail shared file architecture. In this
situation, it is recommended that a dial up async connection be used or that the
speed of the WAN connection be increased to 64 KB or greater.
