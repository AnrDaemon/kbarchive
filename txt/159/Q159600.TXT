TITLE   :PerfMon Server-Sessions Errored Out Also Tracks Autodisconnects
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The Explain details for the Server object, Sessions Errored Out counter in
Performance Monitor, reads as follows:

   The number of sessions that have been closed due to unexpected error
   conditions. Indicates how frequently network problems are causing dropped
   sessions on the server.

This explanation fails to mention that this counter also increments when normal
session disconnects occur as a result of the AUTODISCONNECT parameter. The
AUTODISCONNECT value represents the number of minutes that idle sessions have
before being disconnected automatically by a server. The default value is 15
minutes. This counter increments as a result of normal server operation, not as
an indication of network problems. When this counter increments as the result of
network problems, other symptoms occur, which may indicate a problem exists. If
network users connected to the server remain unaffected when this counter
increments, then automatic disconnections and reconnections occur normally.
Therefore, this behavior is considered an expected condition, not an unexpected
error condition as the Explain button currently reads.


STATUS
======


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
