TITLE   :PPT7: Can't Unpack File To Folder With Extended Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbpng

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to unpack a presentation that was packed with the Pack And Go Wizard
to a folder whose name contains extended or international characters, you
receive an error message similar to this:

   Pack and Go Setup was unable to install the presentation. This disk may be
   full, you may not have write permission for '<directory name>', or it
   may already contain a presentation with the same name.

This message occurs if the folder does not exist. If the folder already exists,
you receive this error:

   The directory '<directory name>' does not exist. Would you like to
   create it?

If you click OK, the presentation may install to the correct folder; however.
Pngsetup.exe may also create a corrupt folder on the same drive.

CAUSE
=====

Pngsetup.exe (the file that unpacks a Pack and Go presentation) is a 16-bit
program that can run under Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT. Pngsetup.exe
does not support folder names with extended characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you run Pngsetup.exe, choose a folder whose name does not contain extended
or international characters in which to unpack the presentation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
