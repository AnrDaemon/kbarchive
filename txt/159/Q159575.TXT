SUMMARY
=======

The SendTime sample that is shipped with the Enterprise Edition of Visual C++
version 4.2 needs DCOM to work. Windows NT version 4.0 supports DCOM by default,
but Windows 95 does not. You can acquire the Windows 95 DCOM components off of
the Visual C++ 5.0 CD or by going to the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q165101 HOWTO: Use Win95 as a DCOM Server

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DCOM requirement is specified under the topic "Learning About the SENDTIME
Distributed Application" in Books Online. You need an operating system with DCOM
to execute this sample.

When you use the Visual C++ Enterprise Edition, the sample builds on Windows 95
and Windows NT 3.51. When you execute the sample, you get an error message
stating that the entry point, CoCreateInstanceEx, is either missing or cannot be
found in Ole32.dll.
