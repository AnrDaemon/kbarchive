SUMMARY
=======

There is no way to determine which team(s) a particular squad leader, platoon
leader, or company commander can affect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On page eighteen of the reference manual, the third paragraph states:

   "If an insignia is displayed, the team is commanded by a squad leader
   (or higher). Squad leaders can affect the men on all the teams under
   their command."

The insignia or rank of a particular soldier is displayed in the soldier monitor.
Although this provides a way to determine if a particular team is affected by a
leader other than the team leader, there is no way to determine which leader
affects which team(s).
