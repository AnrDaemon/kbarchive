TITLE   :XFOR: PCMTA Fails to Respond to NetBIOS Notification
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Exchange Server MS Mail Connector MTA configured for NetBIOS
notification will fail to respond to incoming NetBIOS datagrams. These datagrams
are sent from NetBIOS configured MS Mail clients when urgent mail messages are
sent to recipients on external postoffices.

The MS Mail Connector MTA is designed to respond to these datagrams and alter its
normal cycle so that mail is picked up from the sender's postoffice. Currently,
the MS Mail Connector MTA continues to process mail in the normal fashion
according the normal timing schedule.

CAUSE
=====

The MTA fails to receive the datagrams because it is not properly registering to
receive the multicast directed datagrams.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use an MS Mail external postoffice, because it correctly responds to datagrams
sent from clients. This may serve as a temporary solution until you can obtain
the fixed MS Mail Connector MTA.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
