PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbtool smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

With client computers running Windows 95 with Novell's Client32, Chat in the
HelpDesk functions fails on the first attempt when PermissionRequired is set to
Yes. This problem occurs if the server computer is running Systems Management
Server 1.2 Service Pack 1 on Windows NT Server 3.51 Service Pack 5 or Windows NT
Server 4.0.


The Systems Management Server Administrator will lose the Chat dialog boxes, and
the Chat icon will reappear. If you select Chat again, the chat session becomes
available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set Permission Required to No.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
