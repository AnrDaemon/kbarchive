TITLE   :Setpass.exe May Not Change a NetWare Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINNT:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a client that is running both a Microsoft Client Server Message
Block (SMB) and Novell NetWare, NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) redirectors, the
Setpass.exe utility provided with File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW)
will only change the password on the SMB network.

You may see either of the following errors when attempting to change your
Password:

   Error Getting PDC Name

-or-

   Error Changing Password

CAUSE
=====

Setpass.exe checks to see what type of client it is running on, and sets the
corresponding password. It checks for the SMB client first. If both an SMB and
NCP redirector are loaded, Setpass.exe will detect the SMB redirector, and only
change the password on the SMB network.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, run Setpass.exe with the -N switch. Doing this forces
Setpass.exe to change the password on the NCP network. You can also use the -S
switch to force Setpass.exe to change the password on the SMB network.

The following are some examples on the use of Setpass.exe:

   SETPASS -N <-- Changes the password on an NCP network.

   SETPASS -S <-- Changes the password on an SMB network.
