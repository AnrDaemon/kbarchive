TITLE   :User Manager Fails at Startup If Windows 95 Is in the Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Workstation computers running User Manager for Domains from the
Clients\Srvtools\Winnt directory of the Windows NT Server 4.0 CD may receive the
following error at startup:

   The dynamic link library MSNET32.dll could not be found in the specified
   path.

The error is followed by the search path used to locate the apparently missing
DLL.

CAUSE
=====

Msnet32.dll is not a Windows NT 4.0 file. The error occurs when the directory
for Windows 95 or the Windows NT Server Tools for Windows 95 (NEXUS) are in the
environment path.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Type "SET" (without the quotation marks) from the Windows NT command prompt
   to see if Windows 95 or the Windows NT Server tools are in the search path.

2. Check the Environment tab in the Control Panel System and remove conflicting
   paths if any are present.

3. If there are no conflicting paths, remove the offending path from the
   Autoexec.bat and Autoexec.nt files. You can disable parsing of the
   Autoexec.bat file by setting the ParseAutoexec.bat (Reg_sz) entry to 0
   under:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\NTCurrentVersion\Winlogon
