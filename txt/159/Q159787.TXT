TITLE   :System May Hang with Diamond Stealth 3D Video Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the standard VGA driver with a Diamond Stealth 3D display adapter
under Windows NT 4.0, the system may appear to stop responding (hang) when the
video resolution is changed.

CAUSE
=====

The Diamond Stealth 3D video adapter requires a special driver supplied by the
manufacturer or available in the Drvlib directory on the Windows NT 4.0 compact
disc. If the standard VGA driver is used instead of the special driver, the
system may appear to stop responding if the video resolution is changed. This is
not a problem with Microsoft Windows NT. The video adapter requires a special
driver for resolutions above 640 x 480.
