SUMMARY
=======

It is not possible to select the Account Locked Out check box in the User
Properties dialog box in either User Manager or User Manager for Domains.

CAUSE
=====

Account lockouts are controlled through the Account selection from the Policies
menu in User Manager. This allows setting of lockout parameters for the entire
system.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to keep a particular user from logging in, use the Account Disabled
checkbox in the User Properties dialog box instead of Account Locked Out.

The User Properties box is available by double-clicking on the user's name in
User Manager for Domains.
