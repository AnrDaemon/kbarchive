TITLE   :XADM: Single Forward Slash Treated as Delimiter in DDA Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create an X.400 personal address book (PAB) or one-off entry with the
following format using the Microsoft Exchange client

  /c=us/admd=attmail/dda.type=id/dda.value=fax(b)1234561111(/User One)

when you send a message to this address, the message is returned to you. The
non-delivery report (NDR) is similar to the following:

   From: System Administrator
   Sent: Tuesday, November 5, 1996 12:16 PM
   Subject: Undeliverable: test using migrated PAB address

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject:test using migrated PAB address
   Sent:11/5/96 12:16:08 PM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

   'X.400' on 11/5/96 12:16:12 PM
   The message was undelivered because the specified recipient postal address was
   incorrect
   MSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:SITE:SERVER

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Information Store, during its preliminary check of the
address, regards the single forward slash mark (/) as a delimiter and rejects it
as invalid, causing the non-delivery report.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Include a second slash mark (//) in any X.400 personal address book entries
   created using the Microsoft Exchange client that require a forward slash mark
   in the DDA value.
