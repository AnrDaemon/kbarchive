TITLE   :"Net print" Command May Print One Print Job as Two
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER::2.2c,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A print job sent by a LAN Manager 2.2c client to a Windows NT print queue may be
cut into two.

CAUSE
=====

A Network Monitor trace shows the "net print" command issues a "close spool
file" with the print job's File ID. This results in a portion of the job that
has already been spooled being printed then the rest of the job starts as a new
print job.

RESOLUTION
==========

To check print queue status, use Print Manager instead of "net print" on LAN
Manager client computers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LAN Manager 2.2c.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the client sends a print job and during the job spooling process, if you
check the print queue status using the "net print" command from an MS- DOS
command prompt, you will see multiple entries for one LAN Manager print job in
the print queue. You must be using Print Manager on a computer running Windows
NT to see these multiple entries.
