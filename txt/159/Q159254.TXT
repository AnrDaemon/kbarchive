======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows Sockets programs that use the IPX protocol in Windows 95 may not work
correctly. The program may indicate an "out of memory" error message.

One such program is Attachmate Extra Personal Client, which may not finish Setup
successfully or generate error messages when it lists servers. After creating a
socket, the program's Windows Sockets Bind() call fails with WSAENOBUFS(10055).

CAUSE
=====

WSIPX calls IFSMGR to allocate memory from IFSMGR's heap. If IFSMGR is out of
heap space and the allocation request is for less than one page (4 KB), IFSMGR
does not grow the heap because it assumes this is an interrupt time allocation.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95, and later
versions of this file:

    WSIPX.VXD  version 4.0.953  dated 11/4/96  14,545 bytes

A version of this file that also resolves this problem is included in the Windows
Sockets 2.0 Update for Windows 95. For information about obtaining this update,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q182108 Availability of Windows Sockets 2.0 for Windows 95



The updated WSIPX resolves this problem by calling IFSMGR, when needed, to
explicitly grow the heap.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. An update
to address this problem is now available, but is not fully regression tested and
should be applied only to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for
additional information about the availability of this update.

This issue is resolved in Microsoft Windows 98.
