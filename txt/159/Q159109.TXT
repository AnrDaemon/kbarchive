TITLE   :ExitWindowsEx Does Not Work With NEC Power Switch Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NEC has a power switch service that calls ExitWindowsEx to shut down and power
off computers. This service worked both before and after logging on to Windows
NT 3.51, but fails before logging on to Windows NT 4.0

                                        NT4.0    NT 3.51
After Logon:                            WORKS    WORKS
After Logon when workstation is locked: FAILS    WORKS
Before Logon:                           FAILS    WORKS


Steps to Reproduce This Problem
-------------------------------

1. Log on to the system.

2. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL.

3. Click Lock Workstation.

4. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL (to get the lock dialog box).

5. Press the power switch.

   This causes a power switch interrupt. The NEC power switch driver catches the
   interrupt and calls the power switch service. NEC power switch service calls
   ExitWindowsEx.

6. The machine does not shut down. The system is generally unusable.

CAUSE
=====

The lock workstation routine does not process the
WLX_SAS,WLX_SAS_TYPE_USER_LOGOFF message.
