TITLE   :BUG: FileCopy Does Not Reset Err if Floppy is Write-Protected
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:4.00 | 4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnokeywordkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Err object is not reset after you try to copy a file to a write- protected
floppy disk and the FileCopy command fails with a "Permission Denied" error.
This makes it impossible to copy the file again, even after you remove the
write-protection on the floppy disk.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Kill command is not affected in this way and can be carried out before the
FileCopy command. This enables the Kill command to detect the "Permission
Denied" error first and allows you to remove the write- protection on the floppy
disk before you carry out the FileCopy command. Do the following:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim source As String
      Dim target As String

         On Error GoTo err_handler

         source = "c:\test.txt"

         Open source For Output As #1
         Write #1, "This is a test."
         Close #1

         target = "a:\test.txt"

         If Dir(target) <> "" Then Kill target
         FileCopy source, target

      Exit Sub
      err_handler:

         If Err.Number = 70 Then
             MsgBox "Permission denied. Please remove write-protection."
             Resume
         ElseIf Err.Number = 71 Then
             MsgBox "Disk not ready. Please insert a disk."
             Resume
         End If

      End Sub

STATUS
======

================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a CommandButton, Command1, on Form1.

3. Place the following code in the Command1_Click event:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim source As String
      Dim target As String

         On Error GoTo err_handler

         source = "c:\test.txt"

         Open source For Output As #1
         Write #1, "This is a test."
         Close #1

         target = "a:\test.txt"

         FileCopy source, target

      Exit Sub
      err_handler:

         If Err.Number = 70 Then
             MsgBox "Permission denied. Please remove write-protection."
             Resume
         ElseIf Err.Number = 71 Then
             MsgBox "Disk not ready. Please insert a disk."
             Resume
         End If

      End Sub

4. Run the project by pressing the F5 key.

5. Insert a formatted disk in the floppy, and then click Command1. Text.txt is
   copied to the floppy disk.

6. Write-protect the disk and click Command1. An error message appears to remove
   the write-protection.

7. Remove write-protection and click Command1. Note that the same error message
   appears.
