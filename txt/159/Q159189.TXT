PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform Directory Synchronization between Microsoft Exchange Server and
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the following error(s) may appear in the event
viewer application log:

   Event ID: 13
   Source: X400Proxy
   Type: Warning
   Category: None
   Description: X400 address failure. An illegal type name was specified at
   character position 41 of 'X400:O=ABB;ou1=CHNET;G=URS ;
   F/S=MUELLER;p=ABB;a=400NET;c=CH;'.

   Event ID: 247
   Source: MSExchangeDX
   Type: Error
   Category: MS Mail 3.2
   Description: The e-mail address of the following transaction is not a valid
   format. See previous events logged by the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant
   component for details. The transaction is A MUELLER URS / F (CHNET)
   X400:/C=CH/A=400NET/P=ABB/O=ABB/OU=CHNET/G=URS / F/S=MUELLER. (Thread 0) The
   custom recipient (CR) has not been created on the Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization Agent (DXA) does not properly
handle incoming X.400 addresses that contained a forward slash (or solidus) as
part of a DDA Value. When the DXA encounters a forward slash as part of a DDA
value it reports an error and aborts the transaction. The X.400 custom recipient
is not created in Microsoft Exchange Server .

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix referenced below. The updated Microsoft Exchange DXA will now
allow the forward slash as part of an X.400 DDA value and create the custom
recipient in the Microsoft Exchange Directory. A forward slash (or solidus) is a
valid character in a DDA value as defined by the CCITT (see the More Information
section below).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word

MORE INFORMATION
================

string. The 1988 Blue Book defines the list of printable strings as follows:

   PrintableString char-set is as follows (per Blue Book X.208, Table 5):

   Capital lettersA, .. Z
   Small lettersa, .. z

   Right paren )
   Plus sign+
   Comma,
   Hyphen-
   Full stop.
   Solidus/
