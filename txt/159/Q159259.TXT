-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Spike's World, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To download the games (or transfer the game files from our computer to yours)
from Spike's World, do the following:

1. Click the highlighted game title and you'll go to a special file information
   page that explains the process, talks about the game, and includes a screen
   shot.

2. Downloading and installing from here is almost automatic. For those of you
   who've never done this before, you don't need to be on MSN to play the game.

3. The download process transfers a virus-free set of files from our computer to
   yours over the modem line.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Find the game where it was installed (the installation location is on the file
info page) and start playing.
