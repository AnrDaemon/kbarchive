SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft TN3270/TN3270E server does not provide support for response time
monitor (RTM) performance data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

RTM is used by the local node to maintain statistics on host response times.
This is the time it takes for the host to respond after a 3270 user presses
ENTER or the AID key to send data to the host. These statistics can then be sent
to the host for analysis.
