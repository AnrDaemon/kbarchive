TITLE   :FP97: Graphics File Overwritten in FrontPage Editor
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbgraphic kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In FrontPage Editor when you are prompted to save a graphics file, if you click
"Yes To All," images that were inserted in earlier editing sessions may be
replaced (overwritten).

CAUSE
=====

In FrontPage Editor, when you paste a graphics file from the clipboard,
FrontPage automatically suggests a name for the file. This name consists of a
shortened version of the page name with a number appended to it. If you use this
suggested name, you may overwrite a file in your document that has that same
name. (These suggested names are numbered sequentially for each session of
FrontPage; however, the numbering sequence is reset each time you exit and
restart FrontPage Editor.)

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, use either of the following methods:

Method 1: Avoid using the suggested file name
---------------------------------------------

When you save a pasted image to your web, create a unique file name for the image
(avoid using the suggested name).

Method 2: Avoid clicking "Yes to All"
-------------------------------------

Do not click "Yes To All" when FrontPage prompts you to save images to a
FrontPage web.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
