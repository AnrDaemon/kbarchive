KEYWORDS:kbualink97 kbdta kbmergekbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error message when you attempt to merge using a comma
separated value (CSV) or a tab separated value (TSV) data source exported from
Microsoft Outlook 97 for Windows.

   Record <n> contained too few data fields.

CAUSE
=====

When you export the data from Microsoft Outlook, some of the fields are not
exported. For example, all of the header fields are exported, but empty data
fields are dropped, resulting in fewer fields for some data records than are
present in the header record.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Export File from Outlook as CSV or TSV
------------------------------------------------

When you export the file from Outlook into either CSV or TSV format, follow these
steps:

1. On the File menu, click Import and Export.

2. Select Export To A File and click Next.

3. Select the folder you want to export from. For example, select the Contacts
   folder. Click Next.

4. In the Create A File Of Type list, select either Comma Separated Values
   (Windows) or Tab Separated Values (Windows), and then click Next.

5. Type a name for the new file in the Save Exported Files As box, and click
   Next.

6. Click Map Custom Fields, select the default map, and then click OK.

7. Click Finish.

Method 2: Attach the CSV File Using ODBC
