SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a Visual Basic application on Windows 95 and you click the
ControlBox at the upper-left corner of a MDIChild form and then press the right
arrow key, you receive the following error:

   VB caused a general protection fault in module USER.EXE at 0007:00005b71

This problem does not occur on Windows NT or if the MDIChild form has a menu.


WORKAROUND
==========

You need to add a menu on the MDIChild form to work around this problem.

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Change MDIChild property of Form1 to "True."

3. Insert a MDIForm.

4. Bring the MDIChild form, Form1, to the foreground.

5. Select Tools/Menu Editor.

6. Fill in the Caption field or leave it blank.

7. Fill in the Name field with a name, for example, MnuHidden. Leave the other
   fields unchanged. "Visible" must be checked. Otherwise, a GPF will occur.

8. Click OK, and run the program. Press the RIGHT ARROW key to switch back and
   forth between the system menus of the parent and child forms.
