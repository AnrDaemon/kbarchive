TITLE   :FP97: WWW Links to Current Web Lose "http://" Prefix
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In FrontPage Editor, when you use the World Wide Web tab of the Edit Hyperlink
dialog box to create a link, FrontPage analyzes this link. If the link points to
the web in which the file is saved, the link is converted from a "World Wide
Web" style link to a "current web" style link. That is, the "http://" is removed
from the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the link, and the link is stored
relative to its location in the current web.

CAUSE
=====

FrontPage performs this conversion on all hyperlinks in the current web. It does
this in order to make the web more portable. Once the shortened link is stored,
it will function within that web no matter where the web is moved.

WORKAROUND
==========

To create an absolute link to a file in the current web
-------------------------------------------------------

In the Edit Hyperlink dialog box, click the Current FrontPage Web tab, and, in
the Page box, type the full URL to the page.

To convert a link from a "current web" link to a "World Wide Web" link
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Select the link in FrontPage Editor, click HyperLink Properties on the Edit menu,
click the Current FrontPage Web tab, and then type the full URL in the Page
box.

To modify an absolute link to a page in the current web
-------------------------------------------------------

In the Edit Hyperlink dialog box, make sure that the Page box on the Current Web
tab contains the full URL before you click OK or Apply.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
FrontPage 98 for Window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example
-------

If you save a page called "myfile.htm" in a web called "test" on a server called
"www.myweb.net," the full URL to that page would be the following:

   http://www.myweb.net/test/myfile.htm

If you link to that file from another file in the test web by typing the
following in the URL box on the World Wide Web tab (of the Edit Hyperlink dialog
box),

   http://www.myweb.net/test/myfile.htm

the link will be analyzed and will be converted automatically to this:

   myfile.htm.
