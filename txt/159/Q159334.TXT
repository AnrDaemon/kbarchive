======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view or close the header or footer in a long document, Word repaginates
the document.

This behavior varies depending on the view you are using (page layout, outline,
and so on). In addition, this problem is more apparent when you are working on
the last few pages of your document.

CAUSE
=====

Word repaginates the document in order to determine the document's layout
properties (that is, the properties that determine what the document will look
like on the screen and when it is printed).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, work with the long document in normal view. To
switch to normal view, click Normal on the View menu.
