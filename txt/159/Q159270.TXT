SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how the merge process works in Visual SourceSafe. The
merge process requires three files: an original, and two modified versions of
the original. During the merge process, Visual SourceSafe makes two comparisons:
one between the original file and the first modified version, and another
between the original file and the second modified version. If a change is made
in only one file, the change is inserted into the merged file. If there are
changes in both files in the same location, then a conflict exists. The user
must resolve a conflict manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first file is a snapshot of the file at the point it was branched. This file
is maintained by Visual SourceSafe. The second and third files are the current
versions of the original file that are located in the two branches that you want
to merge, for example:

Branch1     Branch2
-------     -------

 A           A
 B           B
 C           D
 D           E
 E

Visual SourceSafe determines whether "C" was added to Branch1 or deleted from
Branch2 by looking at the first file and determining whether a deletion or
addition occurred.

To understand how the merge process works, assume that the file looked like the
following when it was branched:

Original
--------

A
B
C
D
E

If you merge Branch1 into Branch2, the result is as follows:

Branch1     Branch2
-------     -------
 A           A
 B           B
 C           D
 D           E
 E

During the merge, Visual SourceSafe moves any changes in Branch1 into Branch2. No
changes were made in Branch1. Therefore, both files remain unchanged.

If you merge Branch2 into Branch1, the result is as follows:

Branch1      Branch2
-------      -------
 A            A
 B            B
 D            D
 E            E

During the merge, Visual SourceSafe moves any changes in Branch2 into Branch1.
"C" was deleted from Branch2. Therefore, the change is reflected in Branch1.

NOTE: Visual SourceSafe assumes incremental changes were made to both of the
changed files. When you merge files that are entirely different, you might get
unexpected results.
