======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 1.2 SP1, 1.2 SP2, 1.2 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Client computers running Windows for Workgroups or Windows 95 may receive a
"Please insert diskette in drive X:" message (where X is the drive letter) at 17
percent of the hardware inventory. The message appears after you have applied
Systems Management Server Service Pack 1, 2, or 3.

CAUSE
=====

This is a software regression in the Systems Management Server inventory
component Getdisk.exe.

Getdisk.exe was modified to resolve an issue with inventory collection on MS-DOS
clients with removable cartridge drives installed, such as the Iomega Zip drive.
This modification affected Getdisk.exe code to handle MS-DOS clients with one
floppy disk drive that also impersonate drive B.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the original Systems Management Server 1.2
version of Getdisk.exe. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Retrieve Getdisk.ex_ from the Systems Management Server 1.2 compact disc and
   rename the file to Getdisk.exe (it is not compressed).

2. Copy Getdisk.exe to the Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin directory
   on the computer running Systems Management Server. Getdisk.exe will be
   replicated to your logon servers from this directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2 Service Packs 1, 2 and 3.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
