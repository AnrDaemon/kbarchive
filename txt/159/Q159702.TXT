PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbtoolkbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to migrate user accounts and data from Novell NetWare 3.1x
servers to Windows NT 3.5, 3.51, or 4.0 servers using the Migration Tool for
Netware (Nwconv.exe), the Migration Tool for NetWare may stop responding with an
exception error 0xc0000005 in Nwconv.exe and generate a Drwtsn32.log file.

CAUSE
=====

During migration, the Migration Tool for NetWare builds a Printer Operators
member list. It enumerates all the print servers on the NetWare server and then
builds the user list of who is in the Printer Operator group associated with the
respective print server. The Migration Tool for NetWare sets a buffer size to
hold a print server name less than or equal to 20 characters, including the null
character. NetWare allows less than or equal to 47 characters for the print
server name. Unexpected results may occur when you read a string into the buffer
of a smaller size. In this case, the result is an exception error in Nwconv.exe.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename all the print servers to be less than or equal to 19 characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0.
