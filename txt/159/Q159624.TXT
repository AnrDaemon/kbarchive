SYMPTOMS

When you use the Sysdiff.exe tool, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

   Incorrect arguments. Consult the Windows NT OEM Preinstall Kit documentation

   Unable to load Sysdiff.inf C:\RESKET\Sysdiff.inf. This file is required in

CAUSE

This behavior can occur if one of the following conditions exists:

 - You run the Sysdiff.exe tool included with the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.
   The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit does not include the Sysdiff.inf file, which
   is required for the Sysdiff.exe tool to work properly.

 - You run the Sysdiff.exe command without required switches.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one or more of the following methods:

 - Use the Sysdiff.exe tool located in the Support\Deptools\<platform>
   folder on your Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

 - Copy the Sysdiff.inf file from your Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the folder on
   your hard disk from which you run the Sysdiff.exe tool.

 - Add required switches to the Sysdiff.exe command line.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The prototype form of the Sysdiff.exe command line is as follows:

SYSDIFF.EXE [/snap | /diff | /apply | /dump | /inf]
