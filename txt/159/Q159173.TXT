TITLE   :XCLN: Scanpst.exe Fails w/ Divide By Zero During Step 7 (of 8)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Scanpst.exe, the application terminates with a Divide by Zero
failure.

CAUSE
=====

Scanpst.exe was dividing a number by the result of a function call. In a rare
case, the function call returned zero (which is normal) and the division
operation failed.

WORKAROUND
==========

If Scanpst.exe was started as a result of normal administration, the failure of
Scanpst.exe may not be indicative of any problem in the PST file. Until a
corrected Scanpst.exe is available, continue to use the PST file if possible.

If Scanpst.exe was started due to suspected file corruption, this failure may
prevent Scanpst.exe from correcting the PST file and placing it in a coherent
state. It may be necessary to create a new PST file (saving the current PST file
until a corrected Scanpst.exe is available).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange client
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
