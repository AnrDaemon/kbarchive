=======

This article describes the ports required to chat or connect to game rooms or
lobbies on Zone.com through a firewall, proxy server, Network Address
Translation (NAT), or Internet Connection Sharing (ICS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify that these ports are open or to open these ports, please contact your
network administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).

If you are the administrator of the network, please consult the documentation
provided with your networking software to determine the steps to open these
ports.

Zone.com requires that the following TCP ports be open to sign in, chat, or
connect to game rooms or lobbies:

 - 80

If your network requires that you open these ports based on IP address, you can
determine the class C address range used by the Zone by opening a command prompt
window and running the following command:

   "ping zone.msn.com" (without the quotation marks)
