The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to configure a service to start using something other than the
system account in the Control Panel Services utility, you receive the following
error:

   Cannot set the startup parameters for the <service> service.
   Error 1057 occurred: the account name in invalid or does not exist.

CAUSE
=====

A password must be specified for the account in the "Log on As" dialog box under
This Account.

A set of asterisks are placed in the Password and Confirm Password boxes
automatically when a user account is chosen. Those asterisks do not necessarily
represent the correct password for the chosen account and an entry must be typed
there. If no password is specified, this error occurs, however, Windows NT will
accept the wrong password.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that the proper password is typed in for the Password and Confirm
Password boxes for the user account chosen.
