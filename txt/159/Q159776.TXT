======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Test for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a new test case to a Visual Test project and the project is under
source-code control, Developer Studio may cause one of the following errors:

   MSDEV.EXE - Application Error

   MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module MSVCBLD.PKG at <memory
   location>.

   The instruction at <memory location> referenced memory at "<memory
   location>". The memory could not be "read".

   MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module SSSCC.DLL at <memory
   location>.

   MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at <memory
   location>.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must remove the project from source-code control before adding a new test
case.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual SourceSafe version
5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Under File, New, select Project Workspace (MFC AppWizard EXE). Accept all
   defaults.

2. Under Tools, select Source Control, then select Add To Source Control (keep
   all files checked out).

3. Select the TestView tab (the one with the red check).

4. Right-click the project name and select New.

5. Give the item a name and leave the type as "Test Case."

6. Click OK. Developer Studio will probably generate a fatal application error.
