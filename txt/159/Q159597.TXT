SYMPTOMS
========

While you run the Windows Messaging Setup Wizard, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

   Windows Messaging Setup Wizard
   The path specified for the file C:\Mail\Mailbox.pst is not valid.

   -or-

   Path does not exist. Please verify the correct path was given.

   path and filename of the personal address book you want to use,or choose
   Browse to select a location.

NOTE: The path specified in the preceding error messages is given as an example;
the path may vary depending on your specific path.

CAUSE
=====

You typed in a new path for the personal folder file (PST file) or the personal
address book (PAB file), and one or more folders in the path you specified does
not exist. The Windows Messaging Setup Wizard will only create new folders for
you when you are using Browse.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you must either specify a path that contains an
existing folder or create the folder with Browse before continuing with the
Windows Messaging Setup Wizard.

NOTE: Do not confuse the term "folder" (referring to the term currently used to
represent directories on your hard disk drive) with "personal folder file" (the
file containing your Windows Messaging folders, where mail messages are stored).
