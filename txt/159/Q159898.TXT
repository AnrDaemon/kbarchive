PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Games
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbdisplay kbtlckbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Monster Truck Madness, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Hellbender for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Hellbender or Monster Truck Madness with a Diamond Stealth 3D 2000
video card, you may receive a message that there is either no 3D hardware
support or no support for a specific 3D function when the "Use Hardware
Accelerator" option is turned on in Dxsetup.exe.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use hardware acceleration in the games listed at the top of this article, the
display colors in Windows must be set to 16-bit (64K) high color. To change the
color setting in Windows, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. In the Color Palette or Colors box, click 16-bit high color or 64K color.

   NOTE: This may reduce your desktop area to a lower resolution.

5. Click OK.

6. Close, and then restart the game.

When you start the game, you may receive the following message:

   Your display is currently set to more than 256 colors. This will cause a
   dramatic frame rate slowdown unless you are using a 3D hardware accelerator.
   Please click the help button for instructions on how to change the display to
   256 colors.

Because you are using a 3D hardware accelerator, click the Don't Warn Me Again
check box and ignore the message.
