======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Windows NT and Windows 95 System Policy Editors (Poledit.exe)
interchangeably to create policy files for and on different operating systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT System Policy Editor can run on both Windows NT version 4.0 and
Windows 95, but cannot run on previous versions of Windows NT. The Windows 95
System Policy Editor runs on only Windows 95. However, you must run System
Policy Editor on the operating system for which you intend to create policy
files.

For example, if User1 uses Windows 95 and User2 uses Windows NT Workstation, run
System Policy Editor on Windows 95 to create User1's system policy file, and
then run System Policy editor on Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server to
create User2's system policy file.

Although Windows NT Server version 4.0 provides .adm files for both the Windows
NT and Windows 95 platforms, the files should be loaded only on the appropriate
operating system you are creating policy files for. For example, when creating
system policy files on Windows NT, load Winnt.adm, and when creating system
policy files on Windows 95, load Windows.adm. Common.adm can be used with both
operating systems.

Note: Windows NT Workstation does not include System Policy Editor. To run System
Policy Editor under Windows NT Workstation, install Poledit.exe from the Windows
NT Workstation Resource Kit.
