TITLE   :BUG: Setup Wizard Cannot Locate Files on Non-English Mac OS
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Visual FoxPro for Macintosh Setup Wizard, the following
message appears:

   One or more of the source distribution files defined in <path to FoxPro
   folder>:Distribution Sources:DKSYSTEM.DBF cannot be located (BROWSE FOR
   !FOUND to see which files are missing). Run the Visual FoxPro Professional
   Setup to install the files, then run the Setup Wizard again.

Usually the Setup Wizard cannot find the ODBC Setup PPC Control Panel file.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup Wizard cannot locate some files because the names of the folders
within the System folder are on a non-English Macintosh operating system.

WORKAROUND
==========

This workaround explains how to locate the Control Panel "ODBC Setup PPC," but
you can apply it to any files affected by this problem.

1. Copy the file "ODBC Setup PPC" in your Control Panels folder to the Visual
   FoxPro:Distribution Sources:System:Control Panels folder.

2. Type the following commands in the FoxPro Command window:

         USE SYS(2004)+"Distribution Sources:DKSYSTEM.DBF"
         BROWSE FOR !FOUND

3. Change the "Source" field for ODBC Setup PPC to read:

         System\Control Panels\Odbc Setup PPC

4. Change the "Sourcedir" field for ODBC Setup PPC to read:

         SYSTEM

5. Run Setup Wizard again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this problem in the products listed above and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you build a set of disks for a PPC application, the Setup Wizard pulls
files from the "System Folder:Control Panels" and "System Folder:Extensions"
folders. It looks for all files that it might need for the distribution disks,
even if you do not need them for your application. The options you select in the
remaining steps of the Setup Wizard determine whether these files actually are
placed on your distribution disks.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

You can duplicate this behavior by moving the ODBC Setup PPC Control Panel from
your Macintosh System Folder:Control Panels folder to your desktop, and then
running the Setup Wizard.
