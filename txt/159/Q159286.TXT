TITLE   :XCON: Messages Sent w/AppleSingle File Attachments Get Stuck
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

There are two symptoms caused by the same problem; the symptom you see depends
on how the message is sent from the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client.

Messages sent with an AppleSingle file attachment and no other text get stuck in
the IMC Outbound Delivery Queue. The sender does not receive a non- delivery
receipt (NDR).

Messages sent with an AppleSingle file attachment without a resource fork, such
as a text file created with the Teach Text application, generate the following
error message:

   Event ID: 4081
   Source: MSExchangeIMC
   Type: Error
   Category: SMTP Interface
   Description: Message could not be processed

CAUSE
=====

The Internet Mail Connector (IMC) omits one carriage return/line feed sequence
(CRLF).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
