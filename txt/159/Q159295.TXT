TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange Dir-Sync Failing with Event ID 134
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 3, directory
synchronization (dir-sync) between Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Mail
fails. After you turn up diagnostic logging on the Microsoft Exchange directory
synchronization agent (DXA), the following event ID appears in the application
event log:

   Event ID: 134
   Type: Error
   Source: MSExchangeDX
   Category: Event Handler
   Description:
   Error MH_RC_SESSION_BUSY returned by the MTA. (Thread 812).

CAUSE
=====

Copying the Microsoft Mail Administrator mailbox on outgoing (from Microsoft
Exchange Server) dir-sync messages (whether the computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server is a dir-sync server or requestor) and then deleting these
messages from both the Inbox and Deleted Items folder without reading them
causes a non-read notification (NRN) to be returned to the Message Transfer
Agent (MTA). The MTA fails during message conversion (MDBEF -> P2) and the
message is incorrectly handled.


WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this problem, do the following:

 - Don't copy the dir-sync administrator on dir-sync messages.

 - Don't delete the dir-sync messages.

 - Open the messages before deleting them.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix referenced below. The MTA code was fixed to properly handle the
message conversion.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
