TITLE   :Access Violation in Services.exe Clearing Event Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an application opens the event log file, and then someone tries to clear the
event log, either interactively or by using an application, while the
application still has the event log file open, Services.exe may quit with an
access violation.

After Services.exe quits, RPC will no longer be available. After this occurs,
%SystemRoot%\Drwtsn32.log will be created or updated. Often, NET USE sessions
provided by the server remain active and new sessions can be established. The
following messages may be returned to client requests involving the RPC
services:

   Error 1723: The RPC server is too busy to complete this operation.

-or-

   Error 1722: The RPC server is unavailable.

-or-

   Error 1721: Not enough resources are available to complete this operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Be sure the application closes the event log file before clearing the event
log.

======
