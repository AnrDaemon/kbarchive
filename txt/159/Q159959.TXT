TITLE   :Connection Fails Over IPX with Duplicate SPX Connection ID
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork osr2 win95 kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Windows Sockets to provide stream-type connections over IPX,
or when you are running another program that uses the SPX protocol over IPX, a
connection to a remote node may intermittently fail to be established.

Using Windows Sockets, error 10054 (WSAECONNRESET) may be returned.

CAUSE
=====

Under certain circumstances, it may be possible for the same SPX Connection ID
to be assigned to more than one active SPX connection.

This is a problem with the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol (NWLINK) included with
Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SPX Connection ID uniquely identifies each active SPX connection on a given
node running the IPX/SPX protocol. SPX keeps track of the status of each
connection by its Connection ID. If duplicate Connection IDs are assigned, SPX
cannot correctly track the status of the connection and cannot respond correctly
to received packets.

This symptom, although rare, is more likely to occur when a program is creating
many SPX connections very rapidly.
