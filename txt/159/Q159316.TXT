TITLE   :FPNW Event ID 2024 Generated When Using JetAdmin
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) logs many Event ID 2024s, after which
no NetWare-compatible clients can access the FPNW server.

   Event ID 2024, Source FPNWSrv:

   The description for Event ID (2024) in Source (FPNWSrv) could not be found. It
   contains the following insertion string(s): \Device\FPNWSrv,
   <volumename>.

-or-

   The client at address below was not logged in and attempted to open
   <volumename>.

where <volumename> is a NetWare-compatible volume defined on the FPNW
server.


CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused when a computer running Windows 95, Windows NT
Workstation, or Windows NT Server is also running JetAdmin to monitor the print
queue on the network. The user who logged on to this station is attached to
FPNW, but has not logged on.

JetAdmin program periodically checks for a status file on the SYS volume
(SYS:\LOGIN\HP_PRINT\JETSET.INI). If the client is not logged in to FPNW, NT
will log the event when the client checks for the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that the user is logged on to the FPNW server or try to disable the HP
software from checking for the status file.


NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. SDI (Simple Device Installation) is
now used to install network printers. For more information on this, see:

HP recommends a new software admin package (TCP/IP / IPX/SPX based). For further
