-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

You may receive the following error message when starting the Microsoft Exchange
client after the Preview Pane has been installed from the Microsoft Exchange
Server Resource Kit.

   The Preview Pane Extension (Tripane.dll) is registered more than once in your
   Registry. You should resolve this problem.

This error occurs when starting the Microsoft Exchange client after choosing to
Exit (not Exit and Logoff). Clicking the OK button allows the client to continue
starting up successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
