SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information on how to change the BackColor property of a
shape object in Visual FoxPro to the same color as the form's active title bar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example creates a form that contains a shape. Code in the Click
event of the command button changes the BackColor property of the shape from its
default color to the color of the form's title bar.

1. Create a form

2. Place a shape object on the form. The name of this shape should be Shape1.

3. Add a command button to the form and place the following code in the Click
   event of the button:

      DECLARE INTEGER GetSysColor in User32.dll Integer
      Thisform.Shape1.BackColor=GetSysColor(2)
      ThisForm.Refresh

4. Run the form and press the command button. The backcolor of the shape changes
   to the same color as the forms title bar.

The integer "2" in the GetSysColor() function points to the value of
COLOR_ACTIVECAPTION from the Winuser.h file. The GetSysColor function is case
sensitive; therefore, code must be entered exactly as shown above. The Winuser.h
file is not a Visual FoxPro file. For more information on this file, consult
Windows SDK literature. Information on the GetSysColor() function is available
in the Win32 API Quick Reference help file that ships with Visual FoxPro 3.0 and
3.0b Professional versions.
