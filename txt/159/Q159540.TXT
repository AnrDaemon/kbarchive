SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the HelpDesk functionality for Systems Management
Server, Chat may work normally, but none of the other HelpDesk icons function.
If you exit the HelpDesk and choose any other icon (except for Diagnostics), and
then come back to the HelpDesk, the client will not be found. This problem
occurs if all of the following conditions are true:

 - Systems Management Server is installed onto a computer running Windows NT
   Server 3.51 Service Pack 4 or Service Pack 5.

 - You are using Novell's NetWare 4.1x.

 - The client computer is running Windows 95 with Novell's Client32 loaded.

CAUSE
=====


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. Windows NT Server 3.51 Service Pack 5 or
Windows NT Server 4.0 is also required. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
