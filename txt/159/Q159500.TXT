TITLE   :Using DLC and IPX Protocols May Corrupt Incoming Packets
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbinterop kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use DLC and NWLINK protocols on Windows NT Server version 3.51,
incoming DLC packets may become corrupted. The problem was observed on a
multiprocessor IBM 720 computer with an IBM PCI ETHERNET adapter running Windows
NT Server version 3.51 Service Pack 4, SNA Server and SMS 1.1.

CAUSE
=====

In this case, SMS was generating local traffic (sending and receiving frames to
itself) using UNC name over NWlink protocol. NWLink depends on the NDIS Wrapper
or the NDIS MAC driver to provide loopback functionality. Consequently, frames
are sent out on the wire and then received back in. Occasionally, under stress,
incoming DLC frames were getting corrupted by the loopback nwlink data frames.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, install another protocol (TCP/IP or NetBEUI) using
the Control Panel Network tool and make sure that NWLink is not the first
protocol to bind to the Workstation service.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
