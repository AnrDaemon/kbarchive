TITLE   :SMS Does Not Identify Pentium Pro (P6) Processor Speeds
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbhw kbother kbInventory smsinv kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On computers running MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows systems, the Systems Management
Server Inventory Agent does not detect Intel Pentium Processors (P5) with a
speed of 125 MHz or higher. Nor does it detect Intel Pentium Pro (P6) processors
of any speed; the Inventory Agent reports these processors as P5-150.

CAUSE
=====

The processor normalization code that determines the processor speed does not
have the ability to identify the Pentium Processors (P5) with a speed of 125 MHz
or higher, or any Pentium Pro (P6) processors. These processors were released
after the Systems Management Server inventory code was written. (Computers
running Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server report their inventory based
on the current registry configuration, and are not affected by this problem.)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should
be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.



MORE INFORMATION
----------------

The following P5 and P6 processors are reported as P5-150 in the Systems
Management Server database:

   P5-133
   P5-150
   P5-200
   P6-180
   P6-200
