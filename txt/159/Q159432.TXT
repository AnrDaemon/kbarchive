TITLE   :FP97: Replaced Text Inherits Previous Font Characteristics
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Replace command (on the Tools menu of FrontPage Explorer or the
Edit menu of FrontPage Editor), the font characteristics of the replaced
characters may not be the same as the font characteristics of the characters
that were replaced.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Replace command, FrontPage formats the new text (the text you
typed in the Replace With box) with the characteristics of character immediately
preceding this new text.

The only exception to this behavior is if the preceding character is a carriage
return.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

Method 1: Changing fonts on the first character of the line
-----------------------------------------------------------

Structure font changes in the document such that they occur as the first
characters on the line

Method 2: Changing fonts in the space prior to the characters changed
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure the font changes such that the font switch is applied to the character
immediately preceding the characters which you want to appear in the new font
(even if this character is a space character).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Font characteristics include every setting on the Font tab of the Font dialog
box. To view the Font dialog box, click Font on the Format menu in FrontPage
Explorer.
