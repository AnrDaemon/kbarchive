The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply page numbering to include chapter numbering, you get the
following message:

   There is no chapter numbering to include in the caption or page number. To
   apply chapter numbers use the Bullets and Numbering command on the Format
   menu and select a multilevel list style that is linked to the Heading styles.

The word "multilevel" in the preceding message should be "outline numbered."

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, outline numbering replaces heading numbering.
This message is displayed when you apply page numbering and include chapter
numbering, but it does not affect functionality.

======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
