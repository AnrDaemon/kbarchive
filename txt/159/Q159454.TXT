RESOLUTION
==========

The following criteria can be used to determine if this is a Sev A situation.

Question 1
----------

   Has this server worked previously?

   This is a server that has been up and running and is no longer functioning.
   This is not a test server or an MSDN incident.

Question 2
----------

   Will your business be adversely affected due to this server not working?

   Will there be loss of customers, business, revenue due to this server not
   functioning?

If this computer, with its current configuration and operating system (OS), has

productivity and/or this issue cannot be opened and deferred for callback in the
morning, this could be considered appropriate and handled according to Sev A
guidelines.
