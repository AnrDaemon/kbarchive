TITLE   :SMP Full Duplex Adapter Configuration May Cause a Blue Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbnetwork kbusage kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT system with two network adapters installed may cause a blue screen
when one card is set to SMP Full Duplex and the second card is set to half
duplex.

CAUSE
=====

When the system is stressed by multiple clients, the NDIS layer will go into a
continuous reset mode, which causes all connections in that segment to drop off
and result in the blue screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
