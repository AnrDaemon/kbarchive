SUMMARY
=======

In level 20 of Chip's Challenge, Chip must collect 15 computer chips and make
his way through bugs, tanks, and pink balls to get to the Exit Square.

However, even if Chip doesn't pick up one computer chip, he may still exit this
level. This is because there is no Cosmic Chip Socket to place the computer
chips into.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this level, titled Tossed Salad, Chip has 400 seconds to pick up 15 computer
chips and complete the maze.

In levels that have computer chips to collect, Chip is required to pick up all
the computer chips to pass through the Cosmic Chip Socket before he can go
through the Exit Square.

Unfortunately, in this level, there is no Cosmic Chip Socket, so Chip may exit
the maze without picking up a single chip.
