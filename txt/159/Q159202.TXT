TITLE   :SMS: Deleted User Groups Are Not Removed from the SMS Database
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork kbPGC kbSCMan smspgc smssiteconfigman

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a global group is deleted from a domain, or a user group is deleted from a
NetWare server, it will not be removed from the SMS database after Site Config
Manager enumerates the user groups again. Therefore, deleted user groups will
still appear in the list of groups available to be assigned to SMS program
groups.

CAUSE
=====

Site Config Manager does not keep a history of the groups it found previously,
so it cannot set a pragma:delete for groups that no longer exist when creating
the new user group MIF.

WORKAROUND
==========


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
