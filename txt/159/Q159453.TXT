TITLE   :SNA Server 3.0 5250 Applet Numeric Pad Function Keys Don't Work

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using the SNA Server 3.0 5250 applet, function keys located on the numeric
keypad (such as PgUp, PgDn and Enter) are not mapped to 5250 functions for Page
Up, Page Down, and Enter. The standard cursor control keys for PageUp and
PageDown (located on the keypad positioned between the Backspace and NumLock
keys) and the standard Enter key do work.

The SNA Server 3.0 5250 applet does support limited keyboard remapping by
following the instructions in the <Snaroot>\System\5250.kbd file. This
keyboard mapping support is not available in SNA Server 2.x versions of the 5250
applet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The <Snaroot>\System\5250.kbd file can be edited to support limited
keyboard remapping, for the standard IBM 101 keyboard layout. For example, here
are instructions to add support for the Enter, PgUp and PgDn keys located on the
numeric keypad:

1. Save the original copy of <Snaroot>\System\5250.kbd to 5250.old.

2. Add the following lines to the 5250.kbd file:

   NumPgUp : PAGE_UP
   NumPgDn : PAGE_DOWN
   NumEnter: ENTER

   NOTE: 5250.kbd will already include default entries for the 5250 PAGE_UP,
   PAGE_DOWN, and ENTER functions, mapped to the PageUp, PageDown, and Enter
   keys respectively.

3. Copy the 5250.kbd file to Keyboard.map, and place Keyboard.map in the same
   directory where the Win5250.exe program resides:

    - for Windows 3.x clients, the default is <sna.win>

    - for Windows 95 clients, the default is <sna95>\system

    - for Windows NT clients, the default is <sna>\system

4. Restart the 5250 applet.

5. To verify that the new keyboard mapping is in effect, go to the Keypad option
   on the menu bar and verify that Enter is mapped to NumEnter. If Enter is
   still mapped to Enter, it may be necessary to delete and re-create shortcuts
   to the 5250 applet.
