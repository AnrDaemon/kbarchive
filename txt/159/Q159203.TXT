KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you do an unattended setup with the following section:

      DetectAdapters = ""
      InstallProtocols = SelectedProtocolsList
      JoinWorkGroup = WORKGROUP

      [SelectedProtocolsList]

      TC = TCPIPParameters

      [TCPIPParameters]

      DHCP = NO
      IPAddress = 126.0.10.132
      Subnet = 255.0.0.0

You get a dialog box with the following message:

   The IPAddress key has an invalid IP address. Please correct the problem after
   the property sheet is displayed.

The property sheet will then be displayed with the IP address entered. Click OK,
and the IP address is now accepted. This message only occurs when a zero is the
second or third octet.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been fixed in the Tcpcfg.dll file contained in Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 2.0 and later service packs.

To work around this issue:

1. Rename the Tcpcfg.dl_ file to Tcpcfg.org on the distribution server.

2. Copy the Tcpcfg.dll file from the latest service pack onto the distribution
   server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
