-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the ?Restoring
Registry Key? Help topic in Regedit.exe or the ?Restoring a Registry Key?
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the unattended setup feature in Windows NT 4.0 and install the
NWLINK/IPX protocol, the !AUTONETIPXFRAMETYPE = variable is ignored and,
instead, defaults to autodetect. !AUTONETIPXFRAMETYPE can have the following
values:

      0 = Ethernet II
      1 = Ethernet_802.3
      2 = 802.2
      3 = SNAP
      4 = ArcNet
      ff = Autodetect (default)

The following is a section of an Unattended.txt answer file and shows how this
value would appear in the file:

      [Network]
      DetectAdapters = ""
      JoinWorkgroup = OPK-GRP
      InstallProtocols = InstallProtocolsSection
      InstallServices = InstallServicesSection

      [InstallProtocolsSection]
      NWLNKIPX = NwlinkParams

      [NwlinkParams]
      !AUTONETIPXFRAMETYPE = 0  ;For ethernet II

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the ?Changing Keys and
Values? Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the ?Add and Delete
Information in the Registry? and ?Edit Registry Data? Help topic in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To workaround this problem, complete the following steps:

1. On any computer running Windows NT 4.0 that has the same network card and
   NWLINK/IPX protocol installed, use the Regedit.exe command to export the
   following key:

   HKey_Local_machine\system\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \NwlnkIpx\NetConfig\%Netcard%X

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

   Where X = the number of the netcard installed.

2. Save the key out as any file name (for example Frame.reg).

3. In your I386 share create a directory called $oem$.

4. Use a text editor to create a Cmdlines.txt file with the following commands:

   .\regedit /s .\Frame.reg

5. Place a copy of Frame.reg and Regedit.exe in the $oem$ directory.

6. In your unattended answer file, make sure the OemPreinstall = yes is set in
   the [Unattend] section.

7. Run unattended setup.

STATUS
