SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft System Information (Msinfo32.exe) is a basic tool for gathering system
configuration information. This tool is intended primarily to help engineers
determine information that could indicate problems with the system. Msinfo32.exe
has many more features than the standard Windows NT Diagnostics (Winmsd.exe)
included with Windows NT. Msinfo is distributed in the Microsoft Office
distribution. The Office 7.0, Office 97, and Office 2000 versions work on all
versions of Windows NT through version 4.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Although there are many features available in this tool outlined in the Help
file, one of the most helpful is the ability to list all DLL's and all of their
properties, including whether they are currently loaded. This tool will list all
of the same information for the executables including a special entry for 16-bit
modules. Another commonly used feature is used to review the OLE registration
entries in both the Registry and Win.ini file.
