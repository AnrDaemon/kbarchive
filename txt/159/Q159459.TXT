TITLE   :NWCONV Does Not Transfer Queue Operator Group
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration Tool for NetWare (Nwconv.exe) to migrate Novell
servers to Windows NT, the Queue Operator group is not automatically transferred
to Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to the "Services for NetWare Networks" manual, "The Migration Tool
creates a new user group, called Queue Operators, and adds NetWare Print Queue
Operators to that group." However, this group is not being created after
migration is done.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0.
