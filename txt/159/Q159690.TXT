TITLE   :PRB: Problem Adding Objects Created in VBA to SourceSafe
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are developing a database application that is under Source Code Control
(SCC) using Microsoft Visual SourceSafe integration, and you create a database
object programmatically using Visual Basic for Applications code, you are not
prompted to add the new object to SCC control. When you try to add the new
object manually, you receive a message that there are no objects to add to
Visual SourceSafe.

CAUSE
=====

When you create the new object programmatically, Microsoft Access 97 fails to
notify the SCC integration that a new object exists. This causes a situation
where you cannot add the new object to SCC control until you close and reopen
the database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Close and reopen the database after you create new objects programmatically
under Source Code Control (SCC). This allows the new objects to be added to SCC
correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To demonstrate the issue and how it affects a form that you create
programmatically, follow these steps.

NOTE: The steps in this example require you to install Microsoft Visual
SourceSafe.

1. Create a new database.

2. Create a module and type the following procedure to create a new form with a
   class module:

         Function ClickEventProcForm()
            Dim frm As Form, ctl As Control, mdl As Module
            Dim lngReturn As Long
            On Error GoTo Error_ClickEventProcForm
            Set frm = CreateForm
            Set ctl = CreateControl(frm.Name, acCommandButton, , , , 1000, _
               1000)
            ctl.Caption = "Click here"
            Set mdl = frm.Module
            lngReturn = mdl.CreateEventProc("Click", ctl.Name)
            mdl.InsertLines lngReturn + 1, vbTab & "MsgBox ""Way cool!"""
            DoCmd.Close acForm, frm.Name, acSaveYes
            ClickEventProcForm = True
         Exit_ClickEventProcForm:
            Exit Function
         Error_ClickEventProcForm:
            MsgBox Err & " :" & Err.Description
            ClickEventProcForm = False
            Resume Exit_ClickEventProcForm
         End Function

3. Add the database to SourceSafe Source Code Control.

4. To test this function, type the following line in the Debug window, and then
   press ENTER.

         ?ClickEventProcForm()

5. On the Tools menu, point to SourceSafe and then click Add Objects to
   SourceSafe. Note that you receive a message that there are no objects to add
   to the VSS database.

6. Close the database, and then reopen it.

7. On the Tools menu, point to SourceSafe and then click Add Objects to
   SourceSafe. Note that you can add Form1 to Source Code Control.
