The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Disk Administrator is used to create the various software fault
tolerant and non-fault tolerant solutions provided with both Windows NT Server
and Workstation.

You can create stripe sets without parity and volume sets on a computer running
Windows NT Workstation.

You can also create stripe sets with parity, stripe sets without parity, volume
sets, and mirroring on a computer running Windows NT Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Windows NT it is not possible to mirror any existing software fault
tolerant solutions.

Although you cannot mirror an existing software volume set or stripe set to
another volume using the Windows NT software mirroring solution, you can use a
hardware solution. To mirror Microsoft software fault tolerant and non-fault
tolerant solutions, you must use a supported hardware RAID controller.

In addition, you can use software to mirror a hardware RAID set or a hardware
mirrored drive using Windows NT Disk Administrator.
