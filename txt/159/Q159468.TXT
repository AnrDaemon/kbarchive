PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbvfp kbvfp500aFIX kbvfp500bugkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error occurs running Setup from disks created with the Setup
Wizard:

   Setup Error 915
   Object 1
   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup program.

CAUSE
=====

This message results from a Wzsetup.ini file created by the Setup Wizard in
Visual FoxPro 3.x where the drive letter on the default destination directory
(in step 5 of the new Setup Wizard) was not removed or a UNC path is used.

WORKAROUND
==========

Perform one or both of the following steps:

1. Remove all copies of Wzsetup.ini on your hard drive. (The default locations
   are in your Application folder and in the Visual FoxPro folder.)

2. Tab through the text box specifying the Default Destination folder in step 5
   of the Setup Wizard. By tabbing through the field, the Setup Wizard
   automatically removes the drive letter.

NOTE: It is a good idea to perform the first step (above) in all cases because of
other problems that may occur using an old version of the Wzsetup.ini files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a. There is also an update to the Setup Wizard available in the Microsoft
Software Library.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the Setup Wizard.

2. Open the Wzsetup.ini file in the Application folder with NotePad. Change the
   path in the line "UserDefaultDirectory" to include a drive letter, for
   example, "C:\Source."

3. Run the Setup Wizard again and accept all the default.

4. Run Setup from the disk images created. The error described occurs at the
   point when you receive the message "Searching for installed components."
