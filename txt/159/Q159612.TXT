SUMMARY
=======

You can use Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications to create a dialog box that
prompts a user for a password. Using the PasswordChar property, you can display
"placeholder" characters, such as asterisks, that appear when a user types the
password.

You can use the PasswordChar property of the TextBox control to protect sensitive
information, such as passwords or security codes. The value of PasswordChar is
the character that appears in a control instead of the actual characters that
the user types. If you do not specify a character, the control displays the
characters that the user types.

In the following example, the user form contains a TextBox control that uses the
PasswordChar property to display asterisks instead of the password that the user
types.

Creating the User Form
----------------------

Create the form using the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor.

2. In the Visual Basic project window, click Normal.

   The form will be available to all documents.

3. On the Insert menu, click UserForm.

4. Click the TextBox control on the Toolbox toolbar and then click the form.

   The TextBox control appears in the default size. Drag a sizing handle to
   resize the control or drag the control to move it to a new location.

5. Select the TextBox control and press F4.

   The Properties window appears.

6. In the Properties window, type an "*" (without the quotation marks) for the
   value of the PasswordChar property.

7. Click the CommandButton control on the Toolbox toolbar and then click the
   form.

   The CommandButton control appears in the default size. Drag a sizing handle to
   resize the control or drag the control to move it to a new location.

   Repeat this step to add a second CommandButton control.

8. Select the first CommandButton control and then click Code on the View menu.

9. In the Code window, type "MsgBox TextBox1.Text" (without the quotation
   marks), so that your code looks like this:

   Private Sub CommandButton1_Click ()
      ' When you click this button on the form,
      ' the contents of the text
      ' box appear in a message box.
      MsgBox TextBox1.Text
   End sub

10. On the View menu, click Object to return to the form.

11. Select the second command button control and then click Code on the View
   menu.

12. In the Code window, type "End" (without the quotation marks), so that your
   code looks like this:

   Private Sub CommandButton2_Click ()
      ' When this button is clicked, the form is closed
      ' and the program ends.
      End
   End sub

13. On the File menu, click Save Normal.

Displaying the User Form
------------------------

To display the form, switch to Word, and then do the following:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

2. In the Macro Name box, type "FillInForm" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click Create.

3. In the Code window, type "UserForm1.Show" (without the quotation marks), so
   that your code looks like this:

   Sub FillInForm()
   'This macro displays the user form.
      UserForm1.Show
   End Sub

4. Save and close the macro.

5. Close the Visual Basic Editor.

6. You can now run the macro from Word to display the form.
