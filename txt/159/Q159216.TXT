The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the administrative steps necessary to allow the Korean
Microsoft Exchange client to create one-off addresses such as addresses for
Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, Internet, and X.400.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a user attempts to create a one-off address for an X.400 address in the
Korean Microsoft Exchange client, he or she may not be able to do so because
"X.400 Address" is not listed in the "New Entry" dialog box. The user may see
only "Other Address" and "Personal Distribution List" in the listbox.

In order for the Korean Microsoft Exchange client to display complete set of
address types in "New Entry" dialog box, the Microsoft Exchange Server
administrator needs to install the Korean template on the computer running
Microsoft Exchange Server. To install the Korean template:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, on the Tools menu,
   click Directory Import.

2. Click Import File.

3. Select \\Kor\Tpl\Template.csv in the Korean Microsoft Exchange client compact
   disc.

4. Click Import button.
