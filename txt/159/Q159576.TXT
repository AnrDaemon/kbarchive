TITLE   :FIX: Cannot Open Stored Procedure from Call Stack Context
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbEEdition kbSQL kbVC kbVC500fix kbSQLProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you debug a stored procedure and you close the associated source code
window, you cannot reopen it from the call stack context.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Open a SQL Server stored procedure and start debugging it.

2. When the debugger stops at the first executable statement, close the Source
   Code window for the procedure.

3. Go to the call stack and double-click the procedure name to bring up the
   source code window.

A 'Find Source' dialog box might appear and request the stored procedure's path.
When you cancel this dialog box, the debugger opens a disassembly window at an
arbitrary address.


RESOLUTION
==========

Select the View/Project Workspace menu to open the Project Workspace window.
Open the stored procedure from the data pane in the Project Workspace window. If
you double-click the procedure name in the call stack, the debugger points (with
a green arrow) to the correct statement in the procedure where the debugger is
stopped. Now you can continue debugging.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual C++ version 5.0.
