TITLE   :STOP 0x0000000A May Occur on Multiprocessor Systems
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

During the normal operation of a multiprocessor system, it is possible that that
Windows NT may produce a STOP 0x0000000A error.

On your computer running Windows NT Server, the following stop error message is
displayed:

   STOP 0x0000000A (0xFE5AB000, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x8013D41A)

Note: The first parameter may vary, but the last three should always be the same
on a multiprocessor system.

CAUSE
=====

When the system is performing a fast call interlock operation in the nonpaged
data segment on a multiprocessor system, it is possible that Windows NT will
stop with a STOP 0x0000000A error as the result. This error happens during the
removal of an entry from the front of a singly linked list. It is possible that
a second processor will change the link list head while the other processor is
using it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
