======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 takes approximately 20 seconds to display
folders and files in Network Neighborhood when CSNW is installed. This may also
occur if the NWLink IPX/SPX interface is disabled while the RAS interface is
enabled. If you enable NWLink IPX/SPX on the NIC interface or disable CSNW, the
time decreases to 1 to 2 seconds.


CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the Client Services for NetWare redirector (Nwrdr.sys).
