KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), you may notice multiple security
IDs (SIDs) being displayed in addition to .default and the SID for the currently
logged on user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design in Windows NT 4.0 and occurs when services are
started in the context of a user account other than System or the currently
logged on user. The change in Windows NT 4.0 gives service accounts access to
the Hkey_Current_User portion of the registry.

Additional query words: registry sids user account
