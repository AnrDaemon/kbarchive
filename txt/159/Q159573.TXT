2.0 New Features Added In This Update

2.1 Allowing PPP clients to connect without authentication
----------------------------------------------------------

Setting this registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rasman\PPP\ForceEncryptedPassword

to (DWORD) 3 allows the server to accept incoming PPP clients without
authentication.

2.2 Using MS-CHAP with Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authentication
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to enable MS-CHAP with RADIUS authentication, you must add a registry
value of:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rasman\PPP\CHAP\OfferMSCHAP

and set it to (DWORD) 1. Once this is enabled every incoming PPP connection will
be offered MS-CHAP, and MS-CHAP will be used to authenticate each PPP user
against the RADIUS server that your RAS server is using.
