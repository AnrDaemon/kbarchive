KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to change the string value of the sysContact, sysName, or
sysLocation object on a Windows 95-based computer using an SNMP manager (such as
Hewlett-Packard OpenView), you may receive the following error message:

   SNMP error - sysContact read only (OV3122)

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 SNMP agent allows only read-only access for the sysContact,
sysName, and sysLocation objects.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

Use Remote Registry Editor to set the values listed below for the sysContact,
sysName and sysLocation fields. The sysName object is not exposed by System
Policy Editor (Poledit.exe).
