======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Clip Gallery for Windows 95, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Publisher 97 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you don't have the file called Url.dll in your C:\Windows\System folder, you
can't connect to the Design Gallery Live Web site from Microsoft Clip Gallery
3.0. When you click the Connect to Internet button in Clip Gallery, you see this
expected message:

   If you have access to the World Wide Web, click OK to browse additional clips
   from a special Web page. Clips you select from there are automatically added
   to the Clip Gallery.

When you click OK, the mouse pointer changes to an hourglass for a brief time and
then becomes a pointer again. Nothing else happens.

In addition, if you open the "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft
Shared\Artgalry" folder and double-click the WW_Clip file, you receive this
message:

   RunDll
   Error Loading URL.DLL: The system cannot find the file specified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following products install Url.dll:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95

 - Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows 95,

 - Microsoft Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95

In addition, if you have Windows NT Workstation, version 4.0, this file is
automatically installed.

If you don't have any of the above products, and use a different Web browser, you
may not have this file. In this case, you can't use the button in Clip Gallery
to connect to the Design Gallery Live Web page.

You can, however, connect to this site using other methods. For example, if you
have Microsoft Publisher 97, you can connect to this site using the following
steps. These steps assume that you have a properly configured Web browser and
Internet access.

1. In Publisher 97, click Microsoft Publisher Web Site on the Help menu.

2. Click one of the links to the Design Gallery Live Web site.
