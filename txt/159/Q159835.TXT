TITLE   :XFOR: Exchange IMC Sends Unwanted Notifications
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector (IMC) may send
notifications of non-delivery reports (NDRs) to the postmaster even if the
particular notification is not selected.

If all notifications except for "Message conversion failed" are selected,
notifications for this particular NDR will still be sent to the postmaster.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Set up an "Inbox Assistant" rule to automatically delete the notifications
   for "Message conversion failed" NDRs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
