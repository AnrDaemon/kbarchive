TITLE   :Cannot Disable TCP/IP Hostname Option in Lexmark MarkVision
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you disable the TCP/IP Hostname column option in the Lexmark MarkVision
program, a small column heading labeled "T..." is still visible on the heading
bar. If you move the bar to show more of the column, the TCP/IP Hostname option
is enabled again.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue with the List control. This occurs in any program in which
you try to disable the last column of an object. This is not a fault in
MarkVision.

RESOLUTION
