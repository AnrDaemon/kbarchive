TITLE   :P6 BIOS Must Configure Devices Behind PCI-to-PCI Bridge
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Devices behind a PCI-to-PCI bridge on a P6-based computer will be disabled. The
devices appear in Device Manager with either an exclamation point in a yellow
circle or a red "X," indicating a problem with the device.

CAUSE
=====

OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) does not support the configuration of devices
behind PCI-to-PCI bridges on P6-based computers. The BIOS in P6-based computers
is required to configure the resources for devices behind the bridge.

MORE INFORMATION
================

OSR2 can configure devices behind PCI-to-PCI bridges in protected mode on
Pentium- or 80486-compatible x86 processor-based computers (processors prior to
the P6). Therefore, it is possible to access devices behind the PCI-to-PCI
bridge without BIOS support for resource configuration. Accessing the devices in
real mode is not possible without the support of the BIOS.

NOTE: The retail release of Windows 95 (version 950) does not support the
configuration of devices behind PCI-to-PCI bridges, requiring the BIOS to
configure all devices behind PCI-to-PCI bridges.
