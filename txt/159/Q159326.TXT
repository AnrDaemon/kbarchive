======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows Explorer to create a new document based on a Word 97
document that contains macros, the macros do not appear in the macro name list,
even though they are still stored in the document. (To locate the macro name
list, on the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.)

NOTE: If you have macro virus protection turned on and you click the Disable
Macros button in the warning dialog box, your macros are disabled and they will
not appear in the macro name list.

CAUSE
=====

The table that contains the list of macros is not copied to the new document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To view the list of macros, use either of the following methods:

Method 1: Create a copy of the document using Word
--------------------------------------------------

Create a copy of the document using Word instead of Windows Explorer.

1. Start Word.

2. Open the original document.

3. On the File menu, click Save As.

4. Select the folder you want to save the file in, type a file name for the new
   document, and then click OK.

Method 2: Create a new macro in the new document to rebuild macro table
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you used Explorer to create the document, create a macro in the new document.
This will rebuild the macro table that contains the list of macros stored in the
document.

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

2. In the Macro Name box, type a name, such as "Test" (without the quotation
   marks), and then click Create.

   If you are prompted to replace an existing macro, click No and type a new
   name.

3. On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.

   You do not need to type any commands into the macro.
