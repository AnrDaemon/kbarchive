TITLE   :SMS: Quick Viewer Hotkey Causes Keyboard Problems on Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbtshoot smsremtshoot kbRemoteProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the hotkey sequence 'Left SHIFT+ESC' is used to quit the Quick Windows Viewer
when you remotely control a client computer running Windows NT, the client
computer will act as if the SHIFT key is depressed. The following types of
symptoms may be seen on the client:

 - Typing at a command prompt displays uppercase letters.

 - Clicking on desktop icons on a client computer running Windows NT 4.0 causes
   multiple icons to be highlighted.

 - The Exit command on an application's File menu does not function.

 - The Logoff command on Program Manager's File menu does not function.

 - Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL does not bring up the Windows NT Security dialog box.

Depressing the SHIFT key once on the client computer's keyboard returns the
client to normal.

CAUSE
=====

Although the key sequence Left SHIFT+ESC was only meant for the Quick Windows
Viewer on the Administrator computer, it is also put into the keyboard buffer on
the client computer running Windows NT. This causes the symptoms listed above.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use the 'Left SHIFT+ESC' hotkey sequence; instead, use the Close command
on the Control menu of the Quick Windows Viewer to quit the Viewer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
