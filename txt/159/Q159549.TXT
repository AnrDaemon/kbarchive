SYMPTOMS
========

A table with unequal-size cells is displayed incorrectly in your Web browser.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create a table in which the first row contains the
maximum number of columns in the table. Starting with the second row of the
table, merge the cells to create the unequal-size cells. In the HTML source,
hide the first row by removing the &nbsp; codes from the cells in the first
row.

NOTE: The &nbsp; code inserts a nonbreaking space in the table cell, which
causes empty cells to be displayed in your Web browser.

If you use Word to modify the HTML document, Word adds the &nbsp; codes to
your document. In this case, you need to re-edit the HTML source and remove the
&nbsp; codes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.
