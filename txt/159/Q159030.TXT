-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the steps necessary to troubleshoot problems you may
encounter when playing a head-to-head game of Close Combat on the Macintosh.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you encounter problems when trying to play a head-to-head game, try the
following:

1. If you have Close Combat 1.0, upgrade to 1.0a. To determine the version of
   Close Combat that you have, click About Close Combat on the Apple menu. The
   version is displayed towards the bottom of the right corner.

   To upgrade to Close Combat version 1.0a, download the update from the Close
   Combat World Wide Web site. This site is located on the Microsoft games page
   at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/games

2. If you are using Open Transport 1.1 or MacTCP, upgrade to Open Transport
   1.1.2. Open Transport 1.1.2 provides many corrections including the ability
   for Open Transport to be installed on the 52xx, 53xx, 62xx, and 63xx series
   of Macintoshes. The release of Open Transport 1.1.2 eliminates the need for
   the old MacTCP network technology.

   The Open Transport 1.1.2 update can be found on Apple's web site at:

   http://www.apple.com

   Apple recommends using Open Transport on System 7.5.3 or later. If you do not
   have System 7.5.3 and have a previous version of 7.5, the update to 7.5.3 can
   also be found on Apple's web site.

3. If you are using either MacPPP or FreePPP to establish your Internet
   connection, set the Flow Control to CTS only and set the idle timeout to none
   in the appropriate Control Panel.

4. Because both Open Transport and Close Combat are native to the Power
   Macintosh, they require large amounts of RAM. To decrease the amount of
   memory that these programs require, turn on Virtual Memory. To turn on
   Virtual Memory, do the following:

   a. On the Apple menu, click Control Panels, and then click Memory.

   b. Turn Virtual Memory on and set the amount of disk space used for Virtual
      Memory to the lowest setting allowed.

   NOTE: To provide optimal performance when running your computer with Virtual
   Memory turned on, it is recommended that you upgrade to System 7.5.5. Earlier
   versions of the System software may cause performance degradation if Virtual
   Memory is turned on. These problems were corrected with System 7.5.5. This
   update is also available on Apple's web site.
