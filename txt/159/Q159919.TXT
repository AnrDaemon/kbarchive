TITLE   :XADM: Public Folder Hierarchy Replicates Through Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server Public Folder hierarchy, as you can see in the
Exchange Server Administrator program, is always replicated to other servers in
the organization, even if public folder replication is disabled.

Unlike other directory information, the hierarchy is always replicated through
the exchange of messages handled by the message transfer agent (MTA). This is
also true when replicating within the same site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is not possible to completely prevent public folder replication messages from
going through the MTA queues. The hierarchy is always replicated, even if you
select Never as the public folder replication schedule.
