TITLE   :Memory Corruption on a Windows NT Alpha Platform
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This problem is specific to the Alpha processor platform only. When an
application makes a function call that resolves to the Windows NT call of
ZwMapViewOfSection, and the call is made two or more times in a row (before
calling ZwUnMapViewOfSection), an assertion will sometimes occur (depending on
the size of the mapped region and the physical address passed in). If the
assertion is ignored, some of the PTEs are overwritten.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
