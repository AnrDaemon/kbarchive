SYMPTOMS

A File Transfer in the HelpDesk functions fails with a client computer running
Windows 95 and Novell's Client32. The administrator will see the following error
message on the Systems Management Server Administrator window:

   Unable to communicate with File Transfer slave.

To work around this problem, set Permission Required to No. The Systems
Management Server administrator can also try again. Eventually, this connection
will be made, and File Transfer can continue.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
