TITLE   :Windows NT Muldiv() Function Returns Incorrect Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Muldiv(0,0,-1) returns -1 when it should be 0. The MulDiv function multiplies
two 32-bit values and then divides the 64-bit result by a third 32-bit value.
The return value is rounded up or down to the nearest integer.

   int MulDiv(
       int nNumber,        // 32-bit signed multiplicand
       int nNumerator,     // 32-bit signed multiplier
       int nDenominator    // 32-bit signed divisor

Parameters
----------

nNumber: Specifies the multiplicand.

nNumerator: Specifies the multiplie

nDenominator: Specifies the number by which the result of the multiplication
(nNumber * nNumerator) is to be divided.

Return Values
-------------

If the function succeeds, the return value is the result of the multiplication
and division. If either an overflow occurred or nDenominator was 0, the return
value is -1.

CAUSE
=====

The multiplier is positive, the multiplicand is positive, the divisor is
negative. The result is negative when actually, the result was positive (0).
