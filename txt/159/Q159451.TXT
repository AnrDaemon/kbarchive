TITLE   :INFO: Installing LPR Ports with Windows NT 4.0 Unattended Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbOPK kbSBK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Although there is an option in the Unattended Setup to install TCP/IP printing,
there is no option available to actually install the LPR port. To install the
LPR port in an unattended method, the OEMPreinstall features of unattend must be
used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install LPR ports on a system, the user must be a member of the administrator
group. An advantage of installing LPR ports during an unattended setup is that
the administrator is not required to log on to each workstation to install the
port. A disadvantage of this procedure is that each different LPR port
configuration required for the workstations will need a separate installation
point on the network. Each installation point requires about 80 MB of disk
space.

To install an LPR port (or ports), perform the following steps:

1. Install Microsoft TCP/IP Printing on a Windows NT Workstation or Server
   through Control Panel, Network, Services.

2. After restarting the computer, install the LPR ports with the correct IP
   addresses and desired names through Control Panel, Printer, File, Server
   Properties.

3. Open Regedit.exe (not Regedt32.exe) and go to the

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/Print/Monitors/ 
   LPR Ports/Ports

   subkey. Under Ports, select the IP address and name of the printer you just
   installed. Click Registry/Export Registry File from the menu. Save it as
   Lpr.reg. Do this with each LPR port you have installed, making sure to give
   each .reg file a unique name. Close REGEDIT.

4. Go to the network installation point for Windows NT. Create a subdirectory
   under i386 labeled $oem$. Copy Regedit.exe and the .reg files created in step
   3 to this directory.

5. Create a text file in the $oem$ directory using Edit.com called Cmdlines.txt.
   Add these lines, including quotation marks:

   [Command] ".\regedit /s .\lpr.reg"

   Add an additional line for each port you are installing with the appropriate
   .reg file name.

6. Modify the Unattend.txt file using Edit.com to do an OEMPreinstall and
   automatically install TCP/IP protocol and TCP/IP printing.

7. Run setup from the i386 directory with the following command line:

   winnt /b /s:<sourcefiledir> /u:<unattend file name>

   This procedure will install the LPR ports created in Step 2.
