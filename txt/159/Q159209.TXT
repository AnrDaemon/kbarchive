TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Delivers Only the Mail in the Queue at Dial-Up
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Mail Connector only delivers mail that was in the queue when the
dial-up took place and then begins queuing up mail even though a connection
still exists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. A dial-up connection was never meant to be used as a
persistent connection. Should you require this functionality, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for an alternative method of dial-up
connectivity:
