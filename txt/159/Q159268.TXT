SUMMARY
=======

The Setup Wizard in Visual FoxPro 3.0b Traditional Chinese version (TC version)
or Simplified Chinese version (SC version) supports file names longer than eight
characters on 32-bit platforms. However, it does not support Chinese Windows 3.1
TC version or Windows 3.2 SC version since Windows 3.1 does not support long
file names. Using the Setup Wizard in Visual FoxPro 3.0b, the application cannot
be installed on a Windows 3.1/3.2 platform. If the application needs to be
installed on a Windows 3.1/3.2 platform, perform the following steps:

1. Copy the following three files from the ADD_IN folder on your CD to the
   following path:

      Wzsetup.app => \Vfp\Wizards
      Compress.dbf => \Vfp\Distrib.src
      Acmset16.exe => \Vfp\Distrib.src\Setup\Setup16

2. Completely remove the \Vfp\Distrib folder.

3. If the distribution disks have been created, completely remove the
   \Compress\Diskimage or \Netsetup folder and delete the Dkcontrl.dbf,
   Dkcontrl.cdx, and Wzsetup.ini files from the distribution tree folder
   (Application folder).

4. Run the Setup Wizard to re-generate the distribution files under the \Distrib
   folder.
