TITLE   :SMS: Setup Only Allows 22 Characters for Service Account
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup smssetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify the Service Account in Systems Management Server Setup, there
is not enough room to define a full <domain>\<username> if the
combined account information exceeds 22 characters.

When the Systems Management Server Service Account resides in a trusted domain,
it is necessary to define both the domain name and user name.

The maximum length of a domain name is 15 characters, and the maximum length of a
user name is 20 characters. Adding a character for the backslash ("\"), the
field should allow a total of 36 characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, shorten the user name used for the Systems
Management Server service account.

If a specific account must be used, install Systems Management Server with an
account that is short enough to fit within the 22 character limit. After Systems
Management Server is installed, do the following:

1. Run Setup again.

2. Click Operations, then click SMS Service Account.

3. Configure Systems Management Server to use the desired account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
