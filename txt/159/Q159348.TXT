KEYWORDS:kbhw osr2 win95 kbHardwarekbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Zoomed Video (ZV) PC Card with Windows 95, the card is not
recognized correctly.

In Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2 (OSR2), ZV PC Card devices
are recognized, but are not configured. The driver is loaded, but is never asked
to start. Device Manager indicates that the device has a problem with a Code 7.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 and OSR2 do not include support for Zoomed Video.

Most of the support to enable a ZV PC Card was added to OSR2, but was not enabled
when OSR2 was shipped. As a result, the logical configurations for these devices
get filtered out and the device cannot be started.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
