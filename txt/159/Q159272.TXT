KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Remote Console Server service from the Windows NT Resource Kit,
you may notice that Windows NT is unable to start any new process after you run
the service for a period of time. For example, Windows NT is unable to launch
any new applications or the command shell from the server console.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, stop the Remote Console Server service to free all used
handles and allow new processes to start.

Note: The Remote Console Server has been updated to version 1.0b. This version
resolves the memory leak issue. The file is available on our FTP server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
