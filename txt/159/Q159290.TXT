TITLE   :XFOR: Data Truncated in SMTP Protocol Log
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you look at the SMTP protocol log for the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail
Connector (IMC), you may see that the data portion of a conversation is
truncated.

CAUSE
=====

The function calls being used to output the data to the log file have a buffer
limited to 1024 bytes and first lines were not terminated with a new line
parameter. For example, the function calls \*wvpsprintf() and wsprintf() have a
buffer of only 1024 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix referenced below. Function calls supporting larger buffer sizes
are now used to output the data to the protocol log and first lines are now
terminated with new lines. The function calls \* vsprintf() and sprint() are now
used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
