SUMMARY
=======

This article provides basic information regarding Citrix WinFrame and how it
affects Microsoft Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Q: What is Citrix WinFrame Server?

A: WinFrame is a multi-user Windows application server based on Windows NT Server
3.51. It supports enterprise application deployment using a thin client
architecture. Citrix WinFrame technology allows the clients to run processes on
a remote server while only passing keystrokes, mouse movement, and video over a
connection, usually ISDN or dial-up. This greatly reduces overhead for the
client and allows older, slower systems much greater performance gains.

Q: What are the minimum system requirements to install Exchange Server on a
server running Citrix WinFrame?

A: The minimum software requirements are:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0

 - WinFrame Version 1.6 with Service Pack 4 or higher.

The minimum hardware requirements are:

 - 100MHz Pentium

 - 32 MB of RAM

NOTE: In most e-mail and groupware enterprising networks, it is not recommended
that you run Exchange Server on a Citrix WinFrame server due to poor performance
caused by the additional overhead.
