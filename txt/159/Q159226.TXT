SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Word does not recognize Ami Pro style sheet files (.sty) as Ami Pro
documents. For example, when you attempt to convert a style sheet and select the
Ami Pro 3.0 converter in the Convert File dialog box, default (boilerplate) text
contained in the style sheet is not converted and Word opens a blank document.

CAUSE
=====

Ami Pro uses style sheet files to create new documents, similar to how Microsoft
Word uses templates. Unlike Microsoft Word templates, however, the Ami Pro style
sheet files are text-only files which contain instructions in a format similar
to an .ini file. Because these files are not formatted as Ami Pro documents, the
Ami Pro 3.0 converter opens a blank document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To use the style sheet in Word, first create a document in Ami Pro based on the
style sheet, save it as an Ami Pro document (.sam) and then open this document
in Word.
