TITLE   :CardBus PCMCIA Controller Disabled After Second Boot
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After the second boot with a CardBus PCMCIA controller installed in your
computer, Device Manager may display a red "X" for the two PCMCIA sockets
(meaning they are disabled).

CAUSE
=====

CardBus controllers are dynamically enumerated during the first boot after
installation even though they are installed disabled. On the second boot,
Windows 95 recognizes that the device is disabled and reports this in Device
Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable the PCMCIA controller. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click System.

2. Click the PCMCIA controller, and then click Properties.

3. In the Device Usage box, click the "(Current)" check box to select it.

4. Click OK.

5. Click Close. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

When Windows 95 restarts, the PCMCIA Wizard runs to help you configure the PCMCIA
controller.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CardBus controllers are PCI devices that are dynamically enumerated by the PCI
enumerator. The drivers load during Setup, ignoring the Disable bit in the
registry. During the second boot, Windows Configuration Manager recognizes the
registry entry indicating that the device is disabled, displays a red "X" in
Device Manager, and does not start the controller. CardBus controllers must be
explicitly enabled to invoke the PCMCIA Wizard on the second boot.
