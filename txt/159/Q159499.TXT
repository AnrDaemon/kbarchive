TITLE   :XCLN: Using Microsoft Mail Forms with Exchange
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Electronic Forms created in Microsoft Mail version 3.x can be used from within
the Microsoft Exchange client, but cannot be opened or modified by the Microsoft
Exchange Electronic Forms Designer nor "migrated" to a native Microsoft Exchange
Electronic Form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order for Microsoft Mail Electronic Forms to be accessible from the Microsoft
Exchange client, there must be an Msmail.ini and a Shared.ini file (created by
the Microsoft Mail client) on the client computer with the proper pointers to
the locations of the Microsoft Mail forms.

In order to access Microsoft Mail forms from a Microsoft Exchange client computer
that did not have the Microsoft Mail client installed prior to upgrading, an
Msmail.ini and a Shared.ini file must be copied from a known working computer
and/or the existing .ini files must be manually modified with the proper
pointers.

If the Msmail.ini and Shared.ini have the proper entries, you can access the
Microsoft Mail forms by clicking "Compose/ ......" You cannot access the forms
by clicking New Form on the Compose menu, nor will a menu selection appear under
the Compose option (as do Exchange Forms installed in a Public Folder).
