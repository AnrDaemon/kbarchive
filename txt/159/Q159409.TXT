SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a distribution set with the Setup Wizard and run the setup
program on the target machine, Visual Basic 4.0 does not generate any icons or
groups for the application.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by an invalid character in the application title. For example,
you use parentheses in the title.

WORKAROUND
==========

Remove any non-alpha-numeric characters from the application title and save the
project file. Then create the setup distribution set with the Setup Wizard
again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you compile an application (the "make EXE" menu option), you can use the
"Options" dialog box to type in an application title. Although Visual Basic 4.0
allows you to place certain non-alpha-numeric characters in the title, this
causes the setup program to fail when it creates icons.

When you Save the project, the title is written to the .vbp file in the line
starting with "TITLE=". The Setup Wizard uses this line to set the App Title
that is then used as the default Group and Icon name. The setup program creates
only one group and one icon for the main executable by default. In Windows 95
and Windows 98, the group is not created according to Windows 95 and Windows 98
standards.
