The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 4.0 on a 2.167GB IDE hard disk drive in a Compaq LTE
5000 laptop and choose to convert the file system to NTFS format, Windows NT
will do the conversion but will stop responding after the conversion is
complete. Windows NT will no longer start after the drive is converted to the
NTFS format. The crash will result in a STOP 0x0000007F
UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP error.

The same error occurs if you install Windows NT to a FAT partition and later
convert to NTFS format using the Windows NT convert command.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Compaq LTE 5000 series laptops require an updated hardware abstraction layer
(HAL) to be able to recognize a Compaq 2.167GB hard disk drive that is formatted
as NTFS. The HAL is available for download from Compaq.


To install the updated HAL on the Compaq LTE 5000, perform the following steps:

1. Install Windows NT as normal, but do not to convert to NTFS format.

2. When the Windows NT installation is complete, go to the %SystemRoot%\System32
   directory and rename Hal.dll to Hal.old

3. Copy the updated Hal.dll provided by Compaq into %SystemRoot%\System32
   directory.

4. Restart Windows NT

5. Convert the files system to NTFS using the following command:

   CONVERT C: /FS:NTFS /V
