TITLE   :Cannot Access Server Using NetBIOS Name or IP Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use an IP address to establish a session with a server, and then use the
server's NetBIOS name to attempt to access the server, you receive the following
error message:

   Access is denied.

For example, if you use the following command to establish a session with a
server:

net use \\<###.###.###.###>\ipc$ /u:<domain name>\<user name>

where <###.###.###.###> is the server's IP address, and then attempt to
access the server using its NetBIOS name, you receive the error message.

NOTE: This problem also occurs if you establish a session with a server using the
server's NetBIOS name and then attempt to access the server using its IP
address.

CAUSE
=====

The redirector does not recognize that the IP address and the NetBIOS name
denote the same computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use either the IP address or the NetBIOS name to establish a session with and
access the server.
