PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbIntlDev

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under 16-bit Middle East Windows (Arabic and Hebrew Windows 3.1), if an
application uses the Arabic or Hebrew SDK to create listboxes that are aligned
to the right(using the WS_EX_BIDI_SCROLL style), setting the horizontal listbox
extent causes repaint problems when a listbox is scrolled (fragments of strings
are scattered throughout the listbox when it is scrolled).

RESOLUTION
==========

The same executable can be run on Middle East Windows 95 versions (Arabic
Windows 95, Hebrew Windows 95) without this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

32-bit Middle East applications do not have this problem.
