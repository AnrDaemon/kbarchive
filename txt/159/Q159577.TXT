SYMPTOMS
========

When you shut down or restart a computer with an attached shared printer, you
may not be notified if a print job in the queue is being printed.

RESOLUTION
==========

When a computer with an attached shared printer is restarted, you are prompted
to continue, cancel, or pause printing. If you choose to continue printing, the
print job that was interrupted is printed again from the beginning.

After the print jobs have been restarted, any subsequent attempt to restart or
shut down Windows 95 results in the following message:

   You have print jobs that have not completed and may be lost if you
   shut down Windows. To shut down, click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
