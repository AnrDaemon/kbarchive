The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are logged in to Microsoft Mail and the Display Flashing Menu Bar Icon
notification is turned on, choosing another mail server that has no new messages
waiting does not turn off the flashing icon.

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is more than one way to log out of a Mail account. Logging out by
selecting another server from the Chooser does not disable the flashing icon
notification. However, logging out from the Mail desk accessory (DA) by choosing
Close Mailbox & Sign Out (Close & Sign Out in Mail version 3.00) from
the Mail menu will disable the flashing icon notification.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
