======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to copy a file from a Windows NT computer to a Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 computer, the following error message appears in Windows for
Workgroups:

   Access Denied.
   Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem normally occurs during large file copies (approx. 200K or greater).
A portion of the file is transferred over the RAS connection before the Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client either terminates the session with the server or
stops responding to the server. In addition, the following factors can lead to
the symptom mentioned above:

 - Outdated network files on the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client.

 - Problems with the phone line, phone cable or serial cable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one or all of the following:

 - Install the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 update files from the \CLIENTS\WFW
   directory on the Windows NT Server compact disc.

 - Reduce the modem speed. In Windows for Workgroups 3.11, modify the RAS
   PhoneBook entry. Click Modem and reduce the Initial Bps value.

 - Make sure you are using the correct serial cabling, as documented in the RAS
   Online Help file.

 - Make sure you are not using a 9-to-25-pin converter.

 - Contact your local telephone company to verify the quality of your phone
   line.

 - Some network adapters and/or drivers do not function properly in a switched
   network environment. A common symptom of these cards is not being able to
   ping over 100 bytes. Replace these adapters.
