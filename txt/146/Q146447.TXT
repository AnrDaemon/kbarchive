======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running in debug mode using a dynamically loaded dynamic link library (DLL)
such as an OLE control with a long file name or an .exe file with a long file
name, you may find that it doesn't break at set break points. You may be able to
set break points both before starting and while it is running, but the debugger
will not break on them.

When starting the debug session, you may see the following message from the
Microsoft Developer Studio:

   

   One or more breakpoints cannot be set and have been disabled.
   Execution will stop at the beginning of the program.

If you receive this message and then attempt to set a break point in your code,
you will not be able to do so and the Developer Studio will beep. If this
message does not appear, you will be able to set break points, but they will be
ignored.

This does not occur in Windows 95

CAUSE
=====

The name of the DLL has more than eight characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use DLL names of 8 characters or less.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.2.
