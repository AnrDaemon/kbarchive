The properties and methods exposed on the voice command and voice text OLE
Automation objects do not provide properties or methods that you can use to
select specific engine modes. When an OLE Automation object's Register
method is called, it will select the current default for the site chosen.

This isn't a significant limitation because applications should allow the
Voice-Navigation application installed on a system to select the default
voices. However, this means Visual Basic and Visual Basic for Applications
(VBA) cannot be used to write a Voice-Navigation application.

A similar limitation applies to the voice command and voice text OLE COM
objects, however this can be overcome if the engine mode's GUID is known.
The low level CLSID_SREnumerator and CLSID_TTSEnumerator objects must be
used to find or enumerate a list of the modes installed on a given system.

For voice command applications, a selected mode GUID can be passed in the
gModeID member of the VCSITEINFO structure referenced by the pSiteInfo
parameter of the IVoiceCmd::Register() function. A selected mode GUID can
also be passed as the gVoice parameter of the IVCmdAttributes::SRModeSet()
function. For voice text applications, a selected mode GUID can be passed
in the gModeID member of the VTSITEINFO structure referenced by the
pSiteInfo parameter of the IVoiceTxt::Register() function. A selected mode
GUID can also be passed as the gVoice parameter of the
IVTxtAttributes::TTSModeSet() function.
