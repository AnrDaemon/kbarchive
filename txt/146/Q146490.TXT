TITLE   :Unable to Install New Fonts from the Windows 95 Fonts Folder
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you dual boot between Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 and attempt to add fonts,
the Fonts directories for both WINDOWS and %SystemRoot% are not available in the
Folders list of Add Fonts.

NOTE: Both Fonts directories are viewable using Windows 95 Explorer and Windows
NT Explorer.

CAUSE
=====

When you click Install New Font from the File menu of the Control Panel Fonts
tool, the Add Fonts dialog box appears. This dialog box uses the FileOpen
function of the previous version of Windows NT. Directories with Hidden and
System directory attributes are not listed. By default, the Fonts directories of
WINDOWS and %SystemRoot% have the System directory attribute.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to import Windows 95 fonts from the WINDOWS directory:

1. Create a network share for the Windows\Fonts directory using Windows NT
   Explorer (For example, FONTS).

2. In the Control Panel Fonts tool, click Install New Font from the File menu.

3. Click Network, and type the UNC network path name (For example, \\<My
   Computer>\FONTS).

4. After the font names are retrieved, select the one or multiple fonts you want
   to import and click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WINDOWS directory may have a Read-only attribute in addition to the default
System attribute. The following table lists the different types of folders the
Fonts directory becomes if specific directory attributes are added or removed:

   System   Read-only   Type of Folder
   ------   ---------   --------------
     No         No      Normal Shell folder
    Yes         No      Font folder
     No        Yes      Font folder
    Yes        Yes      Font folder

The Font folder directories are not viewable in the Add Fonts dialog box. If a
directory is a normal shell folder, the fonts are viewable. However, the removal
of the System directory attribute is not recommended.

In addition, if Desktop.ini is removed from the Fonts directory, or the CLSID
line in Desktop.ini is changed, the symptom mentioned above occurs.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
