The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Outlook 98 
 - Microsoft Outlook 97 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If an Exchange Server message is not successfully sent and generates a
non-delivery report (NDR), when you change the intended recipients in the To or
Cc boxes of the message and then resend it, only the recipients that were on the
message that was originally sent are displayed in the resulting resent message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of this behavior:

 - You send a message to an invalid recipient, noone@microsoft.com, and you
   receive an NDR because the intended recipient does not exist.

 - You open the NDR message and click Send Again on the Action menu. You delete
   the original recipient noone@microsoft.com from the To box, replace the
   original recipient with the valid recipient someone@microsoft.com, and then
   click Send.

 - The user someone@microsoft.com receives the message, but noone@microsoft.com
   is displayed in the To box.

This behavior is by design. If you resend an NDR, you only submit the message to
the new recipient; you do not modify the original message header.
