SUMMARY
=======

The following describes how you can set up an image map on an HTML page:

1. Create a DEFAULT.HTM file in the default WWWROOT directory.

2. Find or create a GIF image to be used as the image map.

3. Create the image map file (in CERN format) in the WWWROOT directory.
   Generally, the map file has the same file name as the GIF file. For example,
   create an image map file called MYIMAGEMAP.MAP for MYIMAGEMAP.GIF.

4. Create a link in your DEFAULT.HTM file referencing the image map, as
   follows:

         <A HREF="myimagemap.map"<>IMG SRC="myimagemap.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
           ismap border=0 ALT="Test Image Map"></A>
    

The example code above displays the GIF image on the web page. When a user clicks
a mapped area of the image, the designated link is activated. An image map
editor, such as Map THIS!, can be used to create the "hot spots" on the image
map. Advanced HTML tags can be used to modify the placement of the image on the
page.

For more information, see the documentation of the image map editor.
