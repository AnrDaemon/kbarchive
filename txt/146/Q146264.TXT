TITLE   :XFOR: Clarification of the IMC Maximum Message Size
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Administrator of Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 can configure the
maximum size of a message for transport through the Internet Mail Connector
(IMC) in the General Properties page. The message size an IMC can transfer is
the maximum message size, plus 1,023 bytes. This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if you set the maximum message size to 50KB and the actual message
exceeds it by 2,000 bytes, the following Non-Delivery message appears:

   The content length of the message is too long for the recipient to take
   delivery.

   <Server name> 3903 Message exceeds size limit, choose Maximum to
   restrict the message size and set the value to 50K.

The IMC can transfer a message that is 50 KB plus 1,023 bytes in size.

The maximum message size configuration is useful when you do not want users to
send messages with large attachments, which may affect performance. The maximum
size value ranges from 1 to 2,097,151 KB. This setting applies to both inbound
and outbound messages. If the IMC is used as a site connector, do not restrict
the message size. This allows system messages used for directory replication and
information store updates to pass through the IMC.
