TITLE   :PC NTMMTA: Error 2140 When You Try to Start Instance
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start an instance of the Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT
(NT MMTA), you may get an error 2140. When you stop any MMTA instance from the
Services Manager and Control Panel, the MMTA will not successfully release the
dynamic drives or the home PO, and eventually it exhausts the free list of
drives. A complete reboot of the server is required to make drives available to
the service.

In the above situation, you will usually see the following message:

   Drive is either local, used, or greater than LASTDRIVE. Initializing data
   structures. Could not connect to drive.

CAUSE
=====

The dynamic drive mappings are not being freed when the MMTA service is stopped
because the API call fails on dynamic drives. The drive mapping for the home PO
is also not released.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.5 of the Microsoft
Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT. This problem is fixed in version 3.5.27 of
the NTMMTA.

Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the
availability of this fix.
