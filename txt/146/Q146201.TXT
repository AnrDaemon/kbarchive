KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send a fax from a cellular phone using Microsoft Exchange and a
Motorola Power 14.4 PCMCIA modem, your fax may not be sent.

CAUSE
=====

The default initialization string sent to the modem by Microsoft Exchange
initializes the modem for non-cellular calls only, regardless of the status of
the Use Cellular Protocol option in Modems properties.


RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

The following registry key contains the initialization strings for installed
modems, where <xxxx> is the modem ID number. To determine which ID is the
correct modem, see the DriverDesc key.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Modem\ 
   <xxxx>\Init

Use the following value to use the modem with a cellular phone:

   "2"="AT&F1&D2&C1\\V1S0=0E0V1<cr>"

To return the initialization string to normal (land use), change the key to:

   "2"="AT&F&D2&C1\\V1S0=0E0V1<cr>"

NOTE: You can reset these values to their default values by removing the modem in
Device Manager and then reinstalling it.
