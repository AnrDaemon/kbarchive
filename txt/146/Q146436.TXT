TITLE   :XCLN: Offline Address Book Files Not Removed w/ Remove All
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose the Remove All option while you are running the Microsoft
Exchange client Setup program, the off-line address book (.OAB) files are not
removed.

CAUSE
=====

The .OAB files are stored in the same directory as the off-line store file for
local replication. The default location is the directory of computer's operating
system. This location can be changed by editing the your profile. Therefor, for
the Setup program to remove the .OAB files, it would have to go through each
user's profile looking of the path to the .OAB files.

WORKAROUND
==========

These files can be manually removed by globally searching for *.OAB files and
deleting all instances found.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Windows
client. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
