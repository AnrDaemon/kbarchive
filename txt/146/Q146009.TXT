SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Backup to perform a complete backup using the "Full
System Backup.set" file set, and then perform a compare operation on the
resulting backup set, you may receive the following error message:

   Errors occurred during this operation. Do you want to view them now?

If you click Yes, the Error.log file is opened in Notepad, and lines that contain
the following text are displayed:

   C:\<windows>\HKLMBACK ... Microsoft Backup cannot find this file. If
   this is a network file, the network may not be available. Or, the file Backup
   is looking for may have been deleted or moved.

   C:\<windows>\HKUBACK ... Microsoft Backup cannot find this file. If this
   is a network file, the network may not be available. Or, the file Backup is
   looking for may have been deleted or moved.

   C:\Program Files\Accessories\Full System Backup.Set...Error: The file
   comparison failed. Files in the backup set and in the source are different.

   C:\Program Files\Accessories\LOG\ERROR.LOG...Error: The file comparison
   failed. Files in the backup set and in the source are different.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you perform the compare operation after you close the
"Full System Backup.set" file set. If you have configured Backup to
automatically compare files after each backup operation is performed, the
problem does not occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the errors listed above are the only errors contained in the Error.log file,
the backup and compare operations were successful. The presence of the errors
listed above does not indicate a problem with the backup set.

To prevent this problem from occurring when you use the "Full System Backup.set"
file set, configure Backup to automatically compare files after each backup
operation. To do so, follow these steps:

1. In Backup, click Options on the Settings menu.

2. Click the Backup tab.

3. Click the "Verify backup data by automatically comparing files after backup
   is finished" check box to select it.

4. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the "Full System Backup.set" file set to perform a complete backup,
Backup creates two temporary files called Hklmback and Hkuback in the Windows
folder. These files contain information that Backup uses to rebuild the registry
when you perform a restore operation using the resulting backup set.

The Hklmback and Hkuback files are included in the backup set, and are removed
from the Windows folder when you close the "Full System Backup.set" file set
after the backup operation is finished. When you perform a compare operation on
the resulting backup set, the errors listed above are generated when Backup is
unable to find these temporary files in the Windows folder.
