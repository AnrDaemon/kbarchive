PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp kbvfp300bBUG kbvfp500fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual FoxPro controls saved as a class from the top of a PageFrame's page
appear to be missing from the class when it is modified with the Class Designer.
The problem is that the controls in the class are not viewable due to the fact
that the Top Property is Negative; sometimes the Left property is also Negative.

WORKAROUND
==========

Open the Class, go to the properties sheet, and select the control from the
Object list. Set the Top and Left properties to a positive number (such as 5) to
move the controls down to the viewable area of the Class Designer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.
