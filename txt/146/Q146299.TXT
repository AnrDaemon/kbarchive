TITLE   :XFOR: SMTP Address Space Appears as a Semicolon
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Address Space on the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) is
set to TYPE:SMTP and the ADDRESS value is left blank then on the Site
Addressing-Routing property page the SMTP address appears as a semi- colon (;)
in the VALUE column.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is just a display problem and does not effect the working of the Microsoft
Exchange IMC and the Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent (MTA). The blank
address space on the IMC means that any address of type SMTP should be sent to
the IMC from the MTA.

Microsoft suggests to get better performance from the IMC/MA, the value of "*"
should be used instead of leaving it blank.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
