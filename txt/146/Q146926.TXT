-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95, it brings up the
logon dialog box for an Internet provider. This logon dialog is typically for
either The Microsoft Network (MSN) or CompuServe (WINCIM), but it can be for any
provider that takes advantage of the Windows 95 AutoDial feature.

RESOLUTION
==========

When software for the Internet provided is installed, it automatically
configures the computer to automatically dial whenever a TCP/IP Winsock call is
attempted.

To change this behavior:

 - Run the Control Panel/Internet application and then uncheck the "Connect to
   the Internet as needed" checkbox. If you are using a version of Internet
   Explorer prior to version 3.0x, then the checkbox will be labeled "Use
   AutoDial".

   -or-

 - Alternate click "The Internet" icon on the desktop and select Properties.
   Then click the Connection tab and uncheck the "Connect to the Internet as
   needed" box. If you are using a version of Internet Explorer prior to version
   3.0x, then the checkbox will be labeled "Use AutoDial".
