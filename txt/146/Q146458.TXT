Taskbar, you will get the following error message:

   You cannot drag an item onto a button on the Taskbar. However, if you do this

   drag the item into the window.

However, the window will not open.

If you drag the message to the Desktop first, you can drag and drop the message
on the message window on the Taskbar.
