======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you view two time zones in Schedule+, the secondary time zone displays its
time incorrectly. This will occur if the secondary time zone is not set to
adjust for Daylight Savings Time and the primary time zone is set to adjust for
Daylight Savings Time.

The time for the secondary time zone will be displayed one hour ahead of what it
should when you view a multiple-day view during the days in that view after
Daylight Savings Time is in effect. Once beyond the days in that view, the time
displays correctly.

This same problem occurs when time changes back to standard time. The time will
display one hour behind what it should be when looking at a multiple- day view,
and will display correctly when you get past the last day in that view.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 7.0 of Microsoft
Schedule+. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
