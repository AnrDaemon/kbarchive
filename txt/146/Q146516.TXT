TITLE   :XCLN: Richedit Max Chars Allowed Does Not Recognize Zero
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the Maximum Characters Allowed setting in the Format tab of the
Rich Entry Field to 0, user input will not be limited to none. What actually
happens is that you can enter as many characters as you want in that Rich Entry
Field. The Maximum Characters Allowed setting does not seem to effect data entry
when it has a value of zero. If the value of the maximum allowed characters is
set to anything other than zero, it works correctly.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
4.0 Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT clients. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To have the Rich Entry Field visible but not accept any user input, follow the
steps below:

1. Go to the General tab of the Rich Entry Field.

2. Check the 'Field is: Locked' option on that tab.

3. Regenerate and reinstall the form.

4. The Rich Entry will now be visible, but will not allow any user input.

Additional query words: Rich entry limit zero
