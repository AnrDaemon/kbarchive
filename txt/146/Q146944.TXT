The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a DNS server defined on the Exchange NT server and have the
Internet Mail Connector (IMC) configured to "Use DNS," outgoing messages will
not be delivered if the DNS is unavailable.

If the DNS server identified is unavailable, the IMC will NOT look to the Host
file for another available DNS. It will place the outgoing message in the
Imcdata\out directory for future delivery.


Additional query words: winnt dns imc
