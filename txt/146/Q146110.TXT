PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remove a network connection in File Manager, the following
error message appears:

   There are no network connections to disconnect.

If you type the command "NET USE <drive>: /D" (without quotes) at the MS-
DOS Command Prompt, the following error message appears:

   The network connection could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you connect to a network share on the same computer using
AT.EXE and the Windows NT Scheduler service. For example, if you type the
following at MyComputer and attempt to remove the share (MyShare) in File
Manager or the MS-DOS Command Prompt, the above error messages appear:

   AT 12:00 /interactive "net use d: \\MyComputer\MyShare"


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, type the following at the MS-DOS Command Prompt (using
the names in the example above):

AT 12:15 /interactive "net use d: \\MyComputer\MyShare /d"

NOTE: The AT scheduler keeps its own network connection list.

In some cases, you must stop and restart the Workstation service to clear the
ghosted connections.
