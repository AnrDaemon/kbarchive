TITLE   :Import Project with Same Name as Existing Project Merges Tasks
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you import data into Schedule+ version 7.0, the tasks associated with a
project that currently exists in the schedule will be merged with those
associated with the project. If the imported task has the same name as an
existing task, the information in the task being imported will overwrite the
existing task information.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

The ObjectID's for the individual objects are not exported to the .SCH file
during the export process. This eliminates duplication of ObjectID conflicts
between the two user's appointment books. The New ObjectID's for the Projects or
Tasks will be assigned when the user's appointment book is imported.

In the case where a duplicate Project or Tasks name is found in the destination
appointment book, the imported Project or Tasks will assume the ObjectID of the
existing Project; therefore, it adds the Same_Name_Project/Tasks from the
exported file as part of the existing Project in the appointment book.
