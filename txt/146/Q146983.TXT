The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Apply option in Control Panel Mail and Fax is unavailable (dimmed) even
though you have made changes to the Mail and Fax services. In addition, the
Cancel option in Control Panel Mail and Fax accepts the changes you have made.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The changes to Mail and Fax services are completed immediately. Therefore, the
Apply and Cancel options are not required. Control Panel Mail and Fax uses the
same dialog box as the other Control Panel services, which has the default OK,
Cancel and Apply options. The Cancel option closes Control Panel Mail and Fax.
