SUMMARY
=======

Fields may disappear when they are pasted on a Tab field in the Microsoft
Exchange Forms Designer.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If the selected field is not a container, the pasted control is placed onto the
canvas. This occurs when pasting the following fields: Entry, Listbox, Checkbox,
and Labels. The pasted fields are behind the Tab Field; to view them move the
Tab Field.

This is by design.
