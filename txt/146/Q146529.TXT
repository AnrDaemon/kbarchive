SYMPTOMS
========

When you check spelling and grammar in a document that is accessed over a
network, you may experience heavy network traffic.

CAUSE
=====

You are accessing the file from a Novell 3.12 server within a token ring
environment and you have the Check Grammar As You Type option on. This option is
requesting multiple reads of the document data.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2).


To temporarily work around this problem, you can reduce the amount of network
traffic by turning off the "Check grammar as you type" option. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Spelling & Grammar
   tab.

2. Under Grammar, click to clear "Check grammar as you type" check box.

3. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97
Service Release 2 (SR-2).
