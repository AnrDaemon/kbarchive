TITLE   :XCON: MTA May Stop If Site Connector Is Removed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) might stop unexpectedly if a
message is queued for a Site Connector immediately after the Site Connector is
removed.

CAUSE
=====

The MTA is trying to send out over a connector that no longer exists. It
recovers by attempting to find an alternative route. In this case, the MTA is
erroneously expecting to have information about the deleted Site Connector.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
