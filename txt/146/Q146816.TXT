SUMMARY
=======

You can test Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) ODBC SQL Server
connectivity with several Microsoft SQL Server utilities. This article discusses
the following:

 - Testing Network Named Pipes

 - Testing ODBC Connectivity to SQL Server

 - Graphical SQL Query Tool

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an IIS application has problems connecting to a SQL Server, there may be a
problem with the network or the SQL Server. The following utilities can help
isolate network problems.

Testing Network Named Pipes
---------------------------

There are two utilities included with SQL Server designed to help test network
named pipes. The MAKEPIPE.EXE utility is installed during the setup of SQL
Server. The READPIPE.EXE utility is installed during setup of both DOS and OS/2
workstations.

Both utilities test the integrity of the network named pipe services. To use
these service, please see the SQL Server Help files or the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q68941 : INF: Procedure for Testing Named Pipes

   Q110905 : INF: Readpipe Return Codes

Testing ODBC Connectivity To SQL Server
---------------------------------------

The SQL Server \SQL60\BINN directory contains a 32-bit utility called
ODBCPING.EXE. You can use this utility to troubleshoot connectivity to SQL
Server through Microsoft ODBC SQL Server drivers. For more information on
ODBCPING and other ODBC diagnostic tips, please see the "Connecting to a Data
Source" section in the ODBC SQL Server 6.0 Driver Help file or the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q138541 : INF: ODBCPING.EXE to Verify ODBC Connectivity to SQL Server

   Q140895 : INF: Diagnostic Tips for the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver

Graphical SQL Query Tool
------------------------

You can test the SQL server with the graphical utility called ISQLW.EXE, which is
included with Microsoft SQL Server version 6.0. Please run SQLW.HLP in the \BINN
sub-directory of SQL Server for more information.
