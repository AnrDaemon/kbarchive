SUMMARY
=======

The Find By Symptom feature creates a list of diseases derived from your answers
to questions regarding symptoms.

The list order depends on the main symptom you select.

NOTE: This feature is designed to help you find information relevant to questions
you answer about childhood symptoms. Please keep in mind that any information
you find is in no way comprehensive.

Also, this feature is not intended to be used to diagnose medical conditions or
replace the advice of a health care professional.

Always contact your professional health care provider for medical advice.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you select a main symptom, in most cases Find By Symptom immediately
presents an alphabetized list of articles. These articles are not listed in
order of relevance.

If the main symptom selected has a higher priority, Find By Symptom asks
additional questions to help narrow down the number of relevant articles. When
you answer all of the questions, Find By Symptom presents articles found.

The order of categories and the length of the bars next to them help indicate how
relevant the articles are to your answers.
