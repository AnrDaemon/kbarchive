TITLE   :XCLN: Shutdown Does Not Ask User to Exit Exchange Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you shut down Windows 95 with the Microsoft Exchange client running and
mail in the Outbox, there is no dialog box asking you to exit Microsoft
Exchange.

CAUSE
=====

Typically, when you perform an Exit and Log Off from Microsoft Exchange while
there is mail in the Outbox, the Microsoft Exchange client will display the
following message:

   There is still mail in your Outbox; exit anyway? Yes/No

However, when you choose to shut down Windows 95 with mail in the Outbox, the
Microsoft Exchange client will not display this dialog. This is due to a
deadlocking condition with Windows 95 and Microsoft Exchange. Because of this,
the Microsoft Exchange client cannot prompt the user during shutdown.

This is by design.
