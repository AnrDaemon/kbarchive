 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to export data from Schedule+, the Other Systems option may not be
available.

CAUSE
=====

The option is unavailable because the user that installed Schedule+ is not the
currently logged in user. The Schedule+ information for this menu is written to
the Microsoft Windows NT Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and this information
is different for each user that uses the Windows NT computer.

Additional query words: 7.00 schedule plus gray grey grayed out
