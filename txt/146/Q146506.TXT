OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbdta kbconversion

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you use the Save As command to save a Rich Text
Format (RTF) document with a different file name or in a different file format,
the original document cannot be opened in another program until the file with
the new name or format is closed.

For example, if you save a document called Test.rtf as Test2.rtf, Word closes
Test.rtf. However, if you try to open Test.rtf in another program, such as
WordPad, the following error message will appear:

   The document Test.rtf is in use by another application and cannot be
   accessed.

CAUSE
=====

Word 97 does not release the temporary file lock on RTF files when you save the
document as a new file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2).


STATUS
======
