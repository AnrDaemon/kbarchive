SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0 for Windows, when an existing Schedule+ user
creates a new Schedule+ local file(SCD) and this file is then synchronized
against an existing server schedule, the Default Access Permission will be reset
to NONE. It is necessary to manually reset the Default Access Permission on the
schedule. Access permissions set for individual users will be retained.

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: 7.00
