TITLE   :Mtg Req: Decline and Don't Send Response - Attendee Icon Wrong
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,7.0; Win95:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When User1 sends a meeting request to User2, and User2 declines the meeting but
doesn't send a response (just closes the response without sending it), User1
still shows User2's icon as being the closed envelope with the question mark and
not the red X.

The icons in the Attendees list for User2 still has the envelope with the
question mark, showing that they have been sent a request.

CAUSE
=====

We changed the design from silent response to no response if the user declines
to send a response. Customers complained about Microsoft Exchange sending
messages that they said NO to sending.
