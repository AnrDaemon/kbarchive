TITLE   :XCLN: Some Inbox Rules will not Fire on Bcc'd Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows or Macintosh, when a rule is defined
that activates on mail sent directly to an individual, mail that the individual
receives by being on the Bcc line will not activate the rule. This also applies
when the "Sent directly to me" and/or "Copied (Cc) to me" boxes are checked.
This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example:

John Doe has a Inbox Assistant rule which looks like:

   CONDITION
   TO: John Doe; Sent directly to me; Copied (Cc) to me
   ACTIONS
   MOVE TO: My Mail

Case #1: If John receives a message that was sent directly to him or he received
it by being on the Cc line, the message will be moved.

Case #2: If John receives a message by being on the Bcc line, the message will
not be moved.
