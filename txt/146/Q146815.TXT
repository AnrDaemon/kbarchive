TITLE   :Using Internet Information Server with Windows NT Authentication
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.00 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting to a Windows NT Internet Information Server (IIS), you receive
one of the following error messages:

   From Windows NT Internet Explorer 1.5:

   Authentication is required for this document. The server did not specify a
   supported authentication method.

   From Windows 95 Internet Explorer 2.0:

   Error: Access is Denied.

CAUSE
=====

Your Internet browser software does not support the Windows NT
Challenge/Response password authentication and this option is enabled on the
computer running IIS.

NOTE: This is not the default authentication method for IIS.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are 2 methods to resolve this issue:

1. Upgrade your client software to a version that supports Windows NT
   Challenge/Response password authentication. IIS ships with a version of
   Internet Explorer for Windows 95 that supports this method of authentication.

2. Change the password authentication on the IIS computer to either Allow
   Anonymous or Basic (clear text).
