TITLE   :XCLN: Hidden Groups in Attendees List Not Invited to Meeting
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a meeting request from the Planner tab in Microsoft Schedule+ while
an individual or resource is not visible in the Attendee list, the individual or
resource is not invited to the meeting.

For example, when you click the minus sign next to Required, the list of required
attendees is hidden and the check mark is removed from the check box. If you
click Request Meeting at this point, none of the attendees within the Required
group will be invited to your meeting.

This problem does not occur if, for example, you hide the group of attendees, and
then you click to select the check box next to the group.

To show or hide a group, click the plus (+) or minus (-) signs next to Required,
Optional, or Resource in the Attendees list on the Planner tab. To show or hide
an individual, click to select or clear the check box next to the name of the
individual.

CAUSE
=====

When you hide a group (Required, Optional or Resource), Schedule+ hides all of
the individuals or resources in that group and clears the check box next to the
group. The individuals or resources are not added to your meeting request.

RESOLUTION
==========

To invite all of the attendees,

 - Show the Attendees list before you click Request Meeting.

   -or-

 - Click to select the check box next to the group (Required, Optional, or
   Resource) while the list is collapsed.

If you do not want to invite one or more individuals, click to clear the check
box next to the name of the attendee you do not want to invite before you click
Request Meeting.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
