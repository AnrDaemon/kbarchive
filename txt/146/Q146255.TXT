PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Exchange Windows clients to address a message to a hidden
recipient, the Check Names tool will not resolve the name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The same behavior will occur when you try to send a message. The Microsoft
Exchange Client will return the Check Names dialog box indicating Microsoft
Exchange does not recognize the recipient's name. It will prompt you to create a
new address or pick another user.

You can send mail to the hidden recipient by either using the hidden recipient's
X.400 address to create a custom recipient or placing the hidden recipient's
Microsoft Exchange address in the Personal Address Book before hiding the
recipient.
