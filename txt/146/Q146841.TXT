The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you send mail to a user on a different postoffice (PO), there may be a lot
of extra mail traffic. This extra traffic does not appear when the recipient is
on the same PO as the sender.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this extra traffic, check the Use Local Copy and Use External Delivery
Agent boxes on the MS Mail configuration page of Remote Configuration or LAN
Configuration, depending on the connection type chosen. You will also need to
download the address book. If the address book is absent, the Microsoft Exchange
client will try to use the address book on the Microsoft Exchange Server even if
the Use Local Copy box is checked.
