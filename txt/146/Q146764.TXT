IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server administrators can limit the users who are allowed to log on to
the information store. This can be useful when you need to perform maintenance
or upgrades to the Exchange Server computer and if you need to keep users from
logging on to Exchange.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To limit the users who are allowed to log on to the information store you need
to edit the registry.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To limit allowed users:

1. Stop the Information Store service on the Exchange Server computer.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

   Value Name: Logon Only As
   Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ

5. Click OK. In the Data box, type the distinguished names of the users that you
   want to allow to log on to the information store on separate lines, and then
   click OK. For example:

   /o=microsoft/ou=apps-wga/cn=recipients/cn=user1
   /o=microsoft/ou=apps-wga/cn=recipients/cn=user2

Service, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   to the Information Store

6. Click OK.

7. Quit Registry Editor.

8. Restart the Information Store service.

This procedure allows only those users entered in the registry parameter to log
on to the information store. Users who are not specified in the registry
parameter receive the following error message when they try to connect to the
information store:

   The set of folders could be opened. The attempt to log on to the Microsoft
   Exchange Server has failed.

NOTES:

 - Leaving the registry parameter blank prevents all users from logging on to
   the information store.

 - To allow all users to again log on to the information store, you must remove
   the registry key. To remove the registry key:

   1. Stop the Information Store service on the Exchange Server computer.

   2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

   3. Locate the Logon Only As value under the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

   4. Click the Logon Only As value in the right pane.

   5. On the Edit menu, click Delete.

   6. Quit Registry Editor.

   7. Restart the Information Store Service.
