TITLE   :XCON: Content Not Supported NDR When Using X.400 Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a mail message over an X.400 connection to a Microsoft Exchange
recipient, it might result in the following Non-Delivery Report (NDR):

   The message contains a content type that is not supported.

This can happen regardless of whether it was sent with an attachment or using
Rich-Text Format (RTF).

The following error will be generated in the Application Log of the Microsoft
Exchange Server:

   MSExchangeMTA Event ID 210
   An internal MTA error occurred. Content conversion for message
   C=US;A=ADMD;P=PRMD;L=servername

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is caused by duplication of information on the X.400 address. For
example:

   c=US;p=Microsoft;o=Mail;g=Exchange;s=User;ou=Seattle;cn=Test;s=User

Notice that there are two s= fields. Regardless of whether or not they contain
identical information, it is an illegal address.

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) does not filter the address
itself, but rather passes it down to the content converter to build an O/R
address. This is the point at which it fails and is the reason for the content
type not supported NDR message.
