The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to use Visual FoxPro and ODBC to access data
that resides in ASCII text files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For Visual FoxPro 3.0b, the ODBC drivers for Windows 95, Windows NT, and Windows
3.1x are included with the product. For Visual FoxPro 3.0, ODBC drivers for
Windows NT and Windows 3.1x are included. The ODBC drivers for Visual FoxPro 3.0
and Windows 95 are available as an Application Note titled "Microsoft ODBC
Drivers for 32-Bit Programs" (GE1263).

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

This example demonstrates how to connect to a text file by using ODBC from Visual
FoxPro.

1. Create a comma-delimited text file for use as the data source for the ODBC
   driver by typing each of the following commands in the Command window:

      SET DEFAULT TO home()+"samples\data"
      USE customer
      COPY TO customer.csv DELIMITED  && Creates comma-delimited Customer file
      USE

2. Set up a Text File data source. In Windows 3.1x, do this through the ODBC
   Administrator in the Visual FoxPro program group or by using the ODBC icon in
   the Windows Control Panel. In Windows 95, do this through the 32 ODBC
   Administrator located in the ODBC program group or the Control Panel. In
   Windows NT, do this through the 32 ODBC Administrator in the Visual FoxPro
   program group or the ODBC icon in Control Panel.

3. Use the following steps to set up a Data Source for the Visual FoxPro table
   saved as a comma-delimited file in Step 1:

   a. Open the ODBC or 32 Bit ODBC Administrator icon.

   b. From the Add list, select Microsoft Text Driver, and click OK. The ODBC
      Text Setup dialog box will appear.

   c. Type FoxPro Text Test in the Data Source Name, and then click the Select
      Directory button.

   d. Select the Vfp\Samples\Data directory, and click OK.

   e. Click the Options button, and then click the Define Format button.

   f. In the Define Text Format dialog box, select the Customer.csv file.

   g. Click the Guess button to create a Data Type, Name, and Width for each
      column of the selected file. Select each column, starting with F1, from
      the list. For each item in the list with a Data Type of Char, change the
      Width from 255 to the correct column width (if known). If the correct
      column width is not known, set each to 254 (the value used for the
      purposes of this example). Either way, as each column width is set, click
      Modify. The column width for each Char column must be set to a value less
      than 255 to enable the column to appear in Visual FoxPro as Character
      rather than Memo data.

   h. When you finish, click OK in the Define Text Format dialog box, and then
      click OK in the OCBC Text Setup dialog box. Then click Close in the Data
      Sources dialog.

4. Place the following code in a program (.prg) file that you will run to allow
   connection to the "FoxPro Text Test" data source.

      * Start of Program to connect to "FoxPro Text Test" Data Source

      LOCAL lcSource, lnConHand, lnSQLRes

      * Set initial variable values
      STORE 0 TO lnConHand, lnSQLRes
      lcSource = "FoxPro Text test"  && Text Data Source Name from ODBC Dialog

      * Connect to Text Data Source
      WAIT Window "Attempting connection ..." NOWAIT
      lnConHand = SQLCONNECT(lcSource)
      IF lnConHand > 0
         WAIT Window ;
          "Connected to Text File Driver - Handle:" ;
          + STR(lnConHand,2,0) TIMEOUT 2
      ELSE
         WAIT Window ;
           "Unable to connect to Text File ..." TIMEOUT 2
      ENDIF

      * Bring data into cursor called CustText
      IF lnConHand>0
         lnSQLRes=SQLEXEC(lnConHand, "SELECT * FROM Customer.csv","CustText")
         BROWSE NOWAIT
         lnSQLRes=SQLDISCONNECT(lnConHand) && Remove to leave connection open
      ENDIF

      * End of program

Notes
-----

When a directory is selected in the ODBC Text Setup dialog box, column
information is saved in a file in that directory called Schema.ini. There is a
section in this file for each file in the specified directory that matches the
extensions in the File Extensions list (visible when the Options button is
clicked). The Schema.ini section for the Customer.csv file used in the previous
example appears as follows:

      [customer.csv]
      ColNameHeader=False
      Format=CSVDelimited
      MaxScanRows=25
      CharacterSet=OEM
      Col1=F1 Char Width 254
      Col2=F2 Char Width 254
      Col3=F3 Char Width 254
      Col4=F4 Char Width 254
      Col5=F5 Char Width 254
      Col6=F6 Char Width 254
      Col7=F7 Char Width 254
      Col8=F8 Char Width 254
      Col9=F9 Char Width 254
      Col10=F10 Char Width 254
      Col11=F11 Char Width 254
      Col12=F12 Float

The correct column names and field lengths and from the Customer table (obtained
with a LIST STRUCTURE command) can be used to modify the Schema.ini file as
follows to allow correct column names and widths to appear in Visual FoxPro.
These modifications can also be made through the Define Text Format dialog box.

      [customer.csv]
      ColNameHeader=False
      Format=CSVDelimited
      MaxScanRows=25
      CharacterSet=OEM
      Col1=CUST_ID Char Width 6
      Col2=COMPANY Char Width 40
      Col3=CONTACT Char Width 30
      Col4=TITLE Char Width 30
      Col5=ADDRESS Char Width 60
      Col6=CITY Char Width 15
      Col7=REGION Char Width 15
      Col8=POSTALCODE Char Width 10
      Col9=COUNTRY Char Width 15
      Col10=PHONE Char Width 24
      Col11=FAX Char Width 24
      Col12=MAXORDAMT Float

The Text File driver supports the SQL SELECT and INSERT commands only, not DELETE
or UPDATE. This prevents deleting or modifying existing records.

The maximum width of a column of Character data can be set in Visual FoxPro in
the Remote Data tab of the Options dialog box. The setting in the "Use Memo for
Fields >=:" spinner determines this maximum width. The default value (also
the absolute maximum) for this setting is 255. If this maximum width setting is
exceeded, the data is brought in as Memo data instead of Character data.
