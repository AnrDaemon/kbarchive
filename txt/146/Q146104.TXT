SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to setup directory synchronization (dirsync) so that
individual Microsoft Mail postoffice address lists will be available in the
Microsoft Exchange Address Book.

When you use directory synchronization between Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft
Mail, when viewing the Address Book in the Microsoft Exchange client, all the
Microsoft Mail users appear in a single container in addition to the Global
Address List. Users migrated from Microsoft Mail to Microsoft Exchange may be
used to look for users on a per-postoffice basis.

The following procedure will only work if Microsoft Exchange is defined as the
directory synchronization server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assume you want the following list of Microsoft Mail postoffices to be
displayed:

   MICROSOFT MAIL
      NETWORK1
         PO1
         PO2
      NETWORK2
         PO1
         PO2

To have the above hierarchy populated with the names from the corresponding
postoffices and appear in the Exchange Address Book, follow the steps below:

1. Create containers with the above hierarchy, that is, create a container named
   MICROSOFT MAIL.

2. Create two sub-containers of this container, named NETWORK1 and NETWORK2.

3. Create sub-containers of these containers for the postoffice names listed
   above.

4. When you define the remote dirsync requestors for each Microsoft Mail
   postoffice, in the Import Container property page, select the container
   created in step 1 for that postoffice. For example, if you are defining a
   remote requestor for postoffice NETWORK1/PO1, select the container PO1 that
   is a sub-container of the container NETWORK1.

5. Configure the remaining Remote Requestor settings as you would normally do.

After directory synchronization is successfully completed, Microsoft Mail custom
recipients should be created on the Exchange side for each Microsoft Mail user.
Also, these custom recipients should be created in the container corresponding
to the Microsoft Mail postoffice.
