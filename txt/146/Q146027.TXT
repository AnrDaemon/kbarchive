SUMMARY
=======

When selecting and changing fonts while in the Microsoft Exchange client,
message data may seem to disappear in a very narrow set of circumstances.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a user highlights information and then selects the Footlight MT Light font
having first bold-faced the data, the last character of the data seem to
disappear.

This is a problem with the way that this font is reporting its particular metrics
back to Microsoft Windows. If the user chooses another font, then the data
reappears even if new text has been added.

This is only a problem when the text has first been bold-faced. In the instance
where the font choice is merely changed, the problem does not occur.
