TITLE   :XCLN: Delayed Action Message Rules Don't Work With Remote
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows, Inbox Assistant rules can be used
to perform operations on incoming messages. However, when you are not logged on
to the Microsoft Exchange Server, the rules will not be completed until you sign
in to your mailbox. These are called Delayed Action Messages (DAM).

When you work offline and use remote mail, rules will be ignored.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
