TITLE   :XCLN: Importing 3.x Folders Textizes Meeting Requests
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0; Win95:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you import an MMF that was exported from MSMail 3.x and contains Microsoft
Schedule+ meeting requests, the meeting requests do not appear as a form like
they did in MSMail 3.x. When the Schedule+ appointments are imported, they
become textized and no longer are displayed as a form. The meeting request shows
up in the Microsoft Exchange client with the From, Sent, To, and Subject lines
along with any text that was in the meeting request.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This only happens during the import of an MSMail MMF file. If the MMF file is
migrated to a PST file, the meeting requests are transferred correctly. During
the process of importing the MMF file, the Schedule+ meeting request message
type is set to IPM.Note so that when you view the meeting request in the
Microsoft Exchange client, it appears as a plain text message.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
