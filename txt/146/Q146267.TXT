TITLE   :XCLN: Selecting Sort for Case Sensitivity Inconsistent
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Electronic Forms Designer 4.0 for Microsoft Exchange, inconsistant
behavior can be displayed when similar words with different cases are used.

For example, if the words

   APPLE
   Apple
   apple
   APPLE

are added to the listbox in the Initial Value page for the listbox properties,
selecting Sort might produce the following:

   apple
   APPLE
   Apple
   APPLE

However, selecting Sort again might produce

   Apple
   APPLE
   APPLE
   apple

and so on with each subsequent Sort.

Typically, Microsoft Visual Basic List and Combo boxes ignore case sensitivity
when the sorted property is used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange Forms Designer. We are researching the problem and will post new
information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
