TITLE   :XCON: Administrator Cannot Adjust the Filenames of Attachments
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Attachments sent without a filename (OLE attachments, text, and so forth) are
given a predefined filename by Microsoft Exchange that is not configurable
through the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

Extra text body parts are called X400.txt and Binary body parts are called
Att.dat.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Microsoft Mail 3.x X.400 Gateway, the mail administrator could specify
the filename and extension for mail attachments that had no previously specified
filename. This was done so that these types of messages could spawn external
programs to view the data being sent.

For example, you could specify that all binary body parts have the extension .b14
and then create an association for .b14 to open Microsoft Word.

Microsoft Exchange does not allow for modification of the filename and extensions
of unnamed attachments. Microsoft Exchange is hard-coded to use the filenames
and extensions listed above.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0, of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: binary extensions text body parts
