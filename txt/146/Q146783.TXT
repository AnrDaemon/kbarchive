TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Resolves Domain Names using MX Record Lookup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) resolves domain names for
delivery using an MX record lookup (including the domain search list).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To be consistent with how Sendmail works and consistent with how Sendmail
administrators configure their DNS servers, the IMC should do a CNAME record
lookup (using the domain search list) to canonicalize the domain name and then
search the MX record space with the canonicalized name (without using the domain
search list).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: CNAME IMC RESOLVER DNS Internet
