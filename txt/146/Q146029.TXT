SUMMARY
=======

There is no status indicator to indicate file progress or time with Exchange
client attachments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no status indicator to show progress when an attachment is attached,
saved, or sent. There is no way to see how the attachment is progressing or how
much time is needed to perform a file operation. This is by design.
