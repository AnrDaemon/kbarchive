TITLE   :Sch+ 1.0 User Unable to Read Meeting Details of Sch+ 7.0 User
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,7.0

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Schedule+ version 1.0 and want to add an attendee who uses
Schedule+ version 7.0, you can view the Free/Busy times of the Schedule+ 7.0
user, but you cannot view meeting details.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ 7.0 keeps meeting information in a schedule file that has a format
unknown to Schedule+ 1.0. Schedule+ 1.0 uses files with an extension of CAL, and
Schedule+ 7.0 information is kept in files with extension of SCH. These files
are in different formats.

This does not prevent the exchange of Free/Busy times, just meeting details.


Additional query words: 1.00 7.00
