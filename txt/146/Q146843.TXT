TITLE   :XCLN: Caption Fields Created in EFD Are Truncated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When caption fields are created in Exchange Forms Designer in a high resolution
environment and then viewed in a low resolution, the captions may be truncated.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. The problem is that the font maps differently depending on
resolution, availability, and so on. Label fields should not be created without
allowing for this to occur. This same problem exists in VB as well.
