SUMMARY
=======

The Command Button control has a Picture property that can be assigned a bitmap
(a graphic file with a .bmp extension), which allows the bitmap to be displayed
on the face of the command button. This article shows by example how the Picture
property can be changed at run time to change the bitmap displayed on the
button.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

The following example demonstrates how to change the Picture property of a
command button at run time.

1. Create a new form.

2. In the Form Designer, right-click the form, and select Data Environment.
   Right-click within the Data Environment window, and select Add. Select Other
   in the "Add Table or View" dialog box, and select the Customer table from the
   Testdata database located in the \Vfp\Samples\Data directory.

3. Add a command button (Command1) to the form. Remove Command1 from the Caption
   property by highlighting the Caption property in the Property Sheet and
   pressing the DELETE key. Set the command button's Height property to 50 and
   Width property to 50.

4. Place the following code in the command button's Init event code:

      THIS.Picture = 'C:\VFP\SAMPLES\CONTROLS\GRAPHICS\Arw08dn.bmp'

5. Place the following code in the command button's Click event:

      IF THIS.parent.List1.Height = 23
           THIS.parent.List1.Height = 170
           THIS.Picture = HOME() + 'SAMPLES\CONTROLS\GRAPHICS\Arw08up.bmp'
      ELSE
           THIS.parent.List1.Height = 23
           THIS.Picture = HOME() + 'SAMPLES\CONTROLS\GRAPHICS\Arw08dn.bmp'
      ENDIF

6. Place a list box on the form. Set its Height property to 23, its
   RowSourceType property to 2-Alias, and its RowSource property to
   Customer.Contact.

7. Save and run the form.

8. Press the command button to toggle the Height of the list box and toggle the
   bitmap that displays on the command button.
