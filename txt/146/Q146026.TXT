TITLE   :XCLN: Apply Button in Services Dialog Box Is Inactive
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add or remove services in the Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 Client
property page window, the Apply button is unavailable (gray).

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The standard property page has the OK, Cancel, Apply, and
Help buttons. In this case, the Apply button is not applicable and is disabled.

NOTE: The Help button is not present on every property page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The removal of a service is a destructive operation that can not be undone.
There is no Apply/Cancel metaphor so the Apply button is disabled.
