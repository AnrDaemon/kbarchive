SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the method that the Internet Mail Service uses to obtain
the IP address of the recipient's server when the Internet Mail Service is
configured to deliver messages using DNS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Internet Mail Service is configured to deliver messages using DNS, it
uses the following method to obtain the IP address of the recipient's server:

1. The Internet Mail Service queries the appropriate DNS server for mail
   exchanger (MX) records.

2. If the Internet Mail Service is unable to obtain the IP address by querying
   the DNS server, it requests the following information from the Windows NT
   server:

    - Address (A) records

    - Alias (CNAME) records

    - WINS servers

    - LMHOSTS file

For information about problems that can arise when you attempt to establish
TCP/IP connections using DNS, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
