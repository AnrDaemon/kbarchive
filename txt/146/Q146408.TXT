======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you dial a Microsoft Windows NT-based computer using Chat (Winchat.exe) in
Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups, you are prompted for a domain name and
password.

CAUSE
=====

When you dial a Windows NT-based computer using Chat in Windows 95 or Windows
for Workgroups, domain validation is required.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Windows for Workgroups, if you cache your domain password you are not
prompted for a password when you dial a Windows NT-based computer. In Windows
95, you must always enter your domain password when you use Chat to dial a
Windows NT-based computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although you can cache your domain password when you log on to Windows 95 or
Windows for Workgroups, Chat does not look for the cached password in Windows
95.
