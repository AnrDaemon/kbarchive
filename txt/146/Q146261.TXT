TITLE   :XCLN: Labels Can Be Truncated When Resolution Changes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Label fields used in Electronic Forms generated by the Microsoft Exchange Forms
Designer may become truncated when the screen resolution is changed or a
different video driver is used.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that the font maps differently depending on screen resolution,
font availability, and font type. In addition, different display devices can
have different resolutions (twips per pixel ratios). These differences can cause
form and control sizes and locations to look different from the way they looked
than when they were created. When using tight label fields text truncation or
chopping may occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

The simple resolution is to allow for greater flexibility during the form design
phase.

 - Design form under the lowest resolution (640x480) since fonts scale up better
   than down.

 - Create labels on the form that allow for the text to increase in size and not
   exceed the labels set size.

 - Choose Windows' standard fonts or fonts that are installed on the client's
   workstation(s). TrueType fonts allow for greater flexability and scalability.
