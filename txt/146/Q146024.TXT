SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange clients allow you to enter an alias on the To: line
instead of the complete address of a user. The Microsoft Exchange client will
attempt to resolve the alias to the full address. If there are multiple matching
entries, it will display them and allow you to select the correct address. This
feature is call Ambiguous Name Resolution (ANR).

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways to enter alias names on the To: line. The correct one to
choose depends on how broadly you want the Microsoft Exchange client to search
the address book.

 - With just the ALIAS (TO: ALIAS) - If you choose this option, the client will
   search the entire selected address book for any Surnames, DisplayNames,
   Aliases, Offices, or EmailAddresses that match the alias entered. This will
   include partial matches. If multiple addresses are located, the Microsoft
   Exchange client will display the CHECK NAMES window and allow the user to
   select the correct address.

   Example: If 'ADAMS' is entered on the To: line, the Microsoft Exchange client
   will search the locations listed above and list all items that match ADAMS
   along with partial matches like ADAMSON.

 - With an equal sign (=) preceding the ALIAS (TO: =ALIAS) - If you choose this
   option, the Microsoft Exchange client will search the entire selected address
   book for any Surnames, DisplayNames, Aliases, Offices, or EmailAddresses that
   match the alias entered. This will not include partial matches. If multiple
   addresses are located, the Microsoft Exchange client will display the CHECK
   NAMES window and allow the user to select the correct address.

   Example: If '=ADAMS' is entered on the To: line, the Microsoft Exchange client
   will search the locations listed above and list all items that match ADAMS
   but NOT partial names like ADAMSON.
