======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how you can use OLE Messaging as an alternative to
using a MAPI Session and MAPI Messages .ocx controls to send mail. This
functionality relies on MAPI OLE Automation support at the operating system
level but doesn't require that an .ocx file be added to a form. The MAPI .ocx
files currently available use Simple MAPI as opposed to MAPI 1.0, so they are
superseded by this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OLE Messaging Library is installed with the MAPI Software Development Kit
(SDK). When the OLE Messaging Library is available, the following flag is set in
the Win.ini file:

      [Mail]
      OLEMessaging=1

And it can be found in the registry. Under Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 you will
find it in:

   HKEY_Local_Machine\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem.

Sample Code Showing How to Get This to Work
-------------------------------------------

      *==== Beginning of OLE Messaging Program.

      SESSION=CREATEOBJECT('mapi.session') && Create the MAPI object.
      SESSION.LOGON                        && Logon to mail; With exchange it
                                           && will prompt for a profile.

      NEW=SESSION.OUTBOX.MESSAGES.ADD             && Create a new message.
      NEW.SUBJECT = "Test Mail with OLE Messaging"   && Add a message subject.
      NEW.TEXT="Mail System Test"+CHR(13)+"using OLE!" && Actual message text.

      SENDTO=NEW.RECIPIENTS.ADD    && Add a recipient object
      SENDTO.NAME="myemailaddr"    && Email address to mail message to
      SENDTO.TYPE=1                && 1= "TO:"; 2="CC:"; 3="BCC:"
      SENDTO.RESOLVE               && Looks up address in addressbook.

      NEW.UPDATE       && Required to save changes to a message object.
      NEW.SEND(1,0,0)  && Parameter 1 = save copy in "Sent Mail" folder.
      SESSION.LOGOFF   && Release the MAPI object.

      *====End of OLE Messaging Program.
