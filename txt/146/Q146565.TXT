SYMPTOMS
========

When you use multiple indented IF statements in your .HTX file, the following
error message appears:

   Error performing operation. The template file contains an endif without a
   matching if tag.

The following is a sample code:

      if ...
         if ...
            if ...
            .
            else
            .
            endif
         else
          .
         endif
      else
       .
      endif


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not use IF statements with ELSE for indented IF
statements. The following is a sample code:

   if ...
   if ...
   if ...
   .
   endif
   endif
   else
   .
   endif

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
