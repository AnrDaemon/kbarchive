TITLE   :XADM: Outstanding Delivery Receipts not Sent to New Location
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you move a mailbox from one Microsoft Exchange Server in a Microsoft Exchange
Site to another Server in the same Site, outstanding messages requesting
delivery receipts sent from that mailbox will not return the receipts to the new
mailbox when the messages are delivered.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The delivery receipt will be returned to the mailbox on the original Server and
will not be forwarded to the new location. This only occurs with delivery
receipts, not read receipts. Any subsequent messages requesting delivery
receipts sent after the mailbox is moved will work as expected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange Server. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
