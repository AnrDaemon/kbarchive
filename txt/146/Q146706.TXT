TITLE   :XCLN: Setup Doesn't Remove Icons in Non-Default Group
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The removal option of the Microsoft Exchange client Setup program for Windows NT
will not remove program icons if the Microsoft Exchange client was installed in
a non-default program group. The Windows 3.x and Windows 95 versions of the
Microsoft Exchange client Setup program will do this correctly, however, even
though they will remove the icons, they will not remove the empty program
group.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 is different than the other two because Windows 95 has an Add/Remove
Programs applet in the Control Panel. This will allow you to remove the
Microsoft Exchange icon from the Programs menu.

Another problem that will occur is that if the icons are moved from the original
(default) program group to another, Setup will run correctly, but the icons will
not be removed from the new group. In addition, if the original (empty) group is
left in program manager, it will not be removed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange Windows
clients. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
