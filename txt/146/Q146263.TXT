SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) creates a file and copies
failed messages to the file. The file has an ATT, TXT, or DAT extension. The
file extension assignment is done in the following manner:

 - If an inbound conversion fails, the raw message is copied to a file with the
   TXT file extension. For example, the file name can be Att00xxx.txt.

 - MIME messages. If a parameter is not found in the headers that can be used as
   an attachment name, IMC creates a file with the ATT file extension (either
   from the MIME Type configuration or Content-Type header information). If the
   MIME Content-Type is configured in the property page, the file with the ATT
   file extension is used. If the Content-Type is not configured, the file with
   the DAT file extension is used.

 - If no file name information is detected for non-MIME messages (in
   X-MS-Attachment header or Begin header) and the bodypart is a UUENCODED
   bodypart, IMC creates a file with the DAT file extension.
