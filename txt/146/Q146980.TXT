TITLE   :XCLN: Wrong Personal Folders Service Highlighted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you add an additional Personal Folders service to your profile, the
original Personal Folders service is the one that is highlighted. This might
cause some confusion if you need to delete the newly created service. This is by
MAPI design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you choose to cancel the operation, you will still have two services with the
same name. You might assume that the one highlighted is the newly added service,
but the first service of that type is highlighted.
