TITLE   :Perfmon Lists \ On Instance List For Network Segment Counters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 3 and add the Network Segment
object for a domain controller in Performance Monitor (PERFMON.EXE), only a "\"
(without quotes) appears on the Instance list for any counter. For example, a
"\device\bh_EPRO1" (without quotes) should appear on the Instance list if you
have the Network Monitor Agent and the Intel Etherexpress PRO network adapter
driver installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, replace PERFMON.EXE with the one on the Windows NT 3.51
compact disc. You must expand PERMON.EX_ to PERFMON.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 Service
Pack 3. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
