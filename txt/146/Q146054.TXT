TITLE   :STOP 0xC0000263 When Upgrading to WinNT 3.51 On Compaq Computers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a Compaq computer with Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and restart
the computer, the following STOP error message appears:

   STOP: 0xC0000263 {Driver Entry Point Not Found}
   The \SystemRoot\system32\drivers\Sysmgmt.sys device driver could not locate
   the entry point HalCPQShareInt13 in driver hal.dll.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the Compaq Insight Management Agent is not disabled
before you perform the upgrade.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Restart your computer with another installation of Windows NT 3.51 or another
   operating system. The Compaq Insight Management Agent file SMSMGMT.SYS is
   located in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers directory. If this directory is
   in the NTFS partition, you must use another installation of Windows NT.

2. Rename SYSMGMT.SYS to another file name.

3. Restart the upgraded version of Windows NT. The Insight Management Agent
   fails to load and an error message appears.

4. Load the Compaq Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) with the entry point for
   SYSMGMT.SYS from the latest Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD), or enable
   the the Insight Management Agent by renaming the agent file back to
   SYSMGMT.SYS. The Compaq SSD loads a newer version of the SYSMGMT.SYS.
