TITLE   :XCLN: Not Create a Rule w/ Reply Template If Signed & Sealed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a reply template with the Inbox Assistant included with the
Microsoft Exchange client, you may get the following errors when you close the
Inbox Assistant:

   Changes to the rule could not be saved. The client was unable to successfully
   complete all of the requested operations.

   Changes to the rule could not be saved. The client operation failed.

At this point you can only remove the rule or not use the reply template.

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur when the global security settings of message encryption
and digital signature are turned on for the client.

The Inbox Assistant cannot use a reply template when encryption and/or digital
signatures are turned on as the default client settings. This does not prevent a
user from setting message security preferences in the Compose New Message
dialog.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this error, turn off the default settings:

1. From the Tools menu choose Options.

2. Choose Security and take the check marks out of both "Encrypt message
   contents and attachments" and "Add digital signature to message".

If message security is then desired:

1. From the Compose New Message dialog, click on File, then Properties, then
   Security

2. Place check marks in the desired selections.

This will enable message security for the individual outbound message, however,
it will not reset the global default for the client.

Turning off the default security settings will in no way affect the receiving of
secure message in the Inbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange, version 4.0
Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95 clients. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
