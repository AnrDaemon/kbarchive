KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbnetwork win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51-based computer from a
Windows 95-based computer, your user profile may not be loaded. Instead, a
default user profile may be loaded. Also, when you quit Windows 95, the default
user profile you are using may overwrite your existing user profile in the home
directory on the Windows NT-based computer. Or, you may receive the following
error message:

   An error occurred while copying the file <xxxxx.xxx>. Profile Error 9.

   Some of your profile settings may not be available.

<xxxxx.xxx> usually refers to a .lnk file.

CAUSE
=====

If a user profile is located in a compressed folder on a Windows NT-based
computer, it is not read by Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========


To work around this problem, do not store user profiles in compressed folders on
Windows NT-based computers. If necessary, uncompress the folder used to store
user profiles and re-create the user profiles.

STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although Windows 95 does not read user profiles stored in compressed folders on
Windows NT-based computers, it can overwrite them. When you quit Windows 95, the
current user profile is written to the home directory on the Windows NT-based
computer. If a default user profile is loaded with you log on to Windows 95, the
default profile overwrites your existing user profile when you quit Windows 95.

Uncompressing the folder allows Windows 95 to read user profiles in the folder,
but does not restore user profiles that have been overwritten.
