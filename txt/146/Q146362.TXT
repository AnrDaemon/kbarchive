======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Schedule+ owner has defined a delegate who is in a different time
zone than the owner. When the delegate opens the owner[ASCII 146]s schedule, the
schedule will appear in the time zone of the delegate. When the delegate creates
an appointment and invites users who are in different time zones, the meeting
request will appear in the time zone of the owner.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The meeting wizard will use the time zone of the individual creating the meeting
request. In the event that users are spread across time zones, the meeting
wizard will use the organizer[ASCII 146]s time zone and when the user accepts
(books) the meeting, it will be reflected in their time zone.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 7.0 of Microsoft
Schedule+. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
