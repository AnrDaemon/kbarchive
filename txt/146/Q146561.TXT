TITLE   :XCLN: Controls Disappear From Forms Designer Window
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you drag a control quickly down past the bottom of the Microsoft Exchange
Forms Designer window, the control is scrolled up past the top of the viewable
area of the form and appears to be deleted.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. It occurs because the form has an auto scrolling
feature and even happens if the scroll bars are off. The auto scrolling feature
scrolls the control up out of the viewing area, thus causing the control to
disappear.

WORKAROUND
==========

Increase the size of the canvas so that it's large enough to see the hidden
control or add another control and drag it off the form window in the opposite
direction until the first control is visible again.
