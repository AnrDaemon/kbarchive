TITLE   :XCLN: Win95 Registry Entries for MSMail Function Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail 3.x extensions to the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 Client
cannot be added to the Windows 95 registry under:

   CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail

because Windows 95 registry does not support them. When Windows 95 is installed,
these entries are not created and if these extensions are added to the registry,
they will not function correctly.

STATUS
======

This is by design. Windows 95 will only support registry extensions for the
Microsoft Exchange Clients installed on Windows 95. Windows NT will allow these
registry extensions for both Microsoft Mail 3.x, Windows NT Mail, and the
Microsoft Exchange Windows NT Client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 Client will read the Microsoft Mail 3.x INI
file for the extension information. To get Microsoft Mail 3.x extensions to work
in the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 Client, add them to MSMAIL.INI or
MSMAIL32.INI, not the registry. You should use WritePrivateProfileString() when
adding Microsoft Mail 3.x extension entries for Windows NT, Windows 3.x, and
Windows 95 clients to the MSMAIL(32).INI. The registry settings work in Windows
NT because of Windows NT's IniFileMapping feature, which will read MSMAIL32.INI
to a registry entry.
