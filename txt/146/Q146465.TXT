TITLE   :Err Msg: Setup Cannot Run In a 386 Enhanced Mode Windows...
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95; winnt:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Windows NT 3.51 on a Windows 95 computer with the
"WINNT /B/W" (without quotes) command, the following error message appears:

   Setup cannot run in a 386 Enhanced Mode Windows MS-DOS Command Prompt.
   Exit Windows and run Setup again.
   Setup cannot continue. Press ENTER to exit.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if there is no space between the /B and /W switches for
WINNT.EXE.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, type the following at the command line:

   WINNT /B /W

MORE INFORMATION
================

The /W switch allows WINNT.EXE to run in Windows 95. You can use this switch
with other WINNT.EXE switches. For example, if you want to create boot floppy
disks for CD-ROM or floppy-based Windows NT installation, you can type the
following at the command line:

   WINNT /OX /W

"WINNT /W" allows you to install Windows NT from within Windows, bypassing the
drive locking and enhanced driver issues involved with a Microsoft Windows
install. Again, this bypasses many of the Windows NT install safety features and
is not recommended.

When you type "WINNT /?" (without the quotation marks) at the command line, the
/W switch is not listed. For more information on the /W switch, please see
SETUP.TXT on the Windows NT Server or Workstation 3.51 compact disc.

For more information, regarding the /w switch and Windows NT 4.0 please refer to
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
