TITLE   :PRB: History in Explorer Differs from History File w/ Keywords
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSSafe400 kbSSafe500 kbSSafe600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the History keyword is used, the file's history is reflected in the
document. However, this listing may be different from the listing displayed in
the Explorer. The history prior to the point when keyword expansion was
implemented will not be reflected in the document.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Demonstrate Behavior
-----------------------------

1. Create a new project, and add a file that has a .txt extension. Check the
   file out, make some modifications, and check the file in. Do this several
   times to establish some history entries.

2. Enable keyword expansion. In the Srcsafe.ini file, ensure that the following
   entry exists:

   Keyword_Masks = *.txt

3. Restart SourceSafe, check the file out, and add the History keyword to the
   file ($History: $). Check the file out, make some modifications and check the
   file in. Do this several times, and then compare the history entries in the
   file to the entries in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer. Only the entries made
   after Keyword expansion went into effect will appear in the file.
