KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When UserA tries to delete an item from a folder in UserB's mailbox in which
Delete permissions have been enabled, UserA will receive the following error
message:

   An item could not be deleted. You do not have permission to create a message
   in this folder.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

UserB must give UserA Create Items permission on the Deleted Items folder in
addition to the Delete Items permission on the desired folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

UserB must log into the client and select his/her Deleted Items folder. Click
Properties on the File menu, and select Permissions. Enable the Create Items
permission for UserA.
