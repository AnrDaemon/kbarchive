TITLE   :PRB: Setup Wizard Fails on Files with no Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup Wizard in Visual FoxPro, the Setup Wizard may display the
following error message:

   An invalid output handle error occurred in LcbCompressFile().

After you click OK, the Setup Wizard terminates.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when a file included in the distribution tree has no
name. A file with just an extension and no name (for example, .txt) is
considered to be a valid file under all the supported operating systems.
However, the Setup Wizard is not designed to handle files of this type.

NOTE: This has also been reported to occur when a file in the distribution tree
has a long file name.

WORKAROUND
==========

Make certain that all the files in the distribution tree have a name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a file named .txt

2. Run the Setup Wizard, and specify the distribution tree to be the directory
   that contains the .txt file.

3. Continue through the rest of the steps in the Setup Wizard, and click Finish.
   The error message will occur. After you click the OK button, the Setup Wizard
   terminates.
