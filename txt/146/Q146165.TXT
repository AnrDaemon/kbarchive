TITLE   :XFOR: No Error When IMC Starts and Configured for DNS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) is configured to use a Domain Name Service
(DNS) and there is no resolver, the IMC starts without logging an error in the
event log.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the DNS is not available, there are other ways to resolve the address:

 - The Internet Mail Connector will use the DNS.

 - If there is no DNS, the Internet Mail Connector will read the local Hosts
   file.

 - If the local Hosts file does not contain the address, the Internet Mail
   Connector uses the WINS service to resolve the address. If WINS doesn't
   return an answer to the query, a non-delivery report (NDR) will be sent back
   to the sender of the message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DNS is the method by which an e-mail address is resolved to the TCP/IP address
of a host that can relay the message to the correct user.

REFERENCES
==========

Refer to the "Delivering Messages Using DNS" procedure in Chapter 11 of the
Microsoft Exchange "Administrator's Guide."

1. On the Site menu, click Configuration. Click Connections, then open the
   Internet Mail Connector.

2. Select the Connections tab.

3. Under Message Delivery, select "Use DNS to route all outbound messages using
   domain name service queries." This also includes queries using a hosts file
   or WINS.

   The hosts file is located in the Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc directory.

Additional query words: resolve
