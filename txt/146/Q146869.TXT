TITLE   :ALT+F6 Key Combination Does Not Work in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95 4.00
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience any of the following symptoms:

 - You cannot use the ALT+F6 key combination to switch between a program's
   non-document windows, although other programs seem to have this
   functionality.

 - You cannot assign the ALT+F6 key combination to a macro in programs that
   allow a keyboard shortcut to be assigned to a macro.

 - The F16 key on your Wang keyboard does not work.

CAUSE
=====

The ALT+F6 key combination is reserved for use by Windows 95. Programs that try
to control this key combination are unable to use it.

On keyboards with 16 function keys (such as the Wang keyboard), keys F13-F16 are
mapped to other key combinations. The F16 key is mapped to the ALT+F6 key
combination.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the mouse to switch between windows in your program, or assign another key
combination to the macro in your program.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Reserved key combinations (ALT+TAB, CTRL+ESC, ALT+ESC, and ALT+F6) are captured
by Windows 95. These key combinations are captured by Windows 95 to prevent
programs from interfering with task switching, thereby improving overall system
reliability.
