TITLE   :XCLN: Cannot Delete a Network Connection After Inserting File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot delete a network connection that has a reference to a file that has
been inserted into a message in the Exchange client. When you try to delete the
network connection from a DOS prompt you will receive this error: " There are
open files on the connection. Close all files and quit all programs related to
the connection before you try to delete". There is more help available by typing
NET HELPMSG 2404." If you try to disconnect the drive from file manager, you get
this error: "There are currently files open on <drive>: connected to
\\server\share. If you do not close the files before disconnecting from the
network device, data may be lost. Do you want to disconnect the device anyway?"
and you are given an option to disconnect the drive.


CAUSE
=====

This is caused by the Microsoft Exchange client keeping a open reference to the
last opened drive or directory. For example, if another message is created
referencing a file on a different share, the mapped drive letter referencing the
share in the first message can be now be deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Exit and Log Off from of the Exchange client. You can then remove the mapped
drive through either the File Manager or the MS-DOS prompt using the net use
<drive> /d.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
clients. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
