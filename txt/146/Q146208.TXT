PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select Help while creating a new FAX recipient using the Microsoft
Exchange client for Windows NT or the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95,
you will receive the following error message:

   The topic does not exist. Contact your application vendor for an updated Help
   file. [129]

   OK

When you select Help while creating a new FAX recipient using the Microsoft
Exchange client for Windows 3.x, you will receive the following error message
twice:

   Help topic does not exist.

   OK

A Fax help screen will appear in the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x
but the information in the help file does not match the actual fax template. The
fax template fields are:

   Display Name
   Location
   Company
   Fax Number

and the help file in the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x displays the
following:

   Display Name
   Fax Address
   TO/CC/BCC
   << Previous
   >> Next

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
