SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Bounds Checker Standard or Professional version 3.0, Visual
C++ version 4.0 gives a page fault upon start up,

Windows 95 reports:

   

   Msdev

   This program has performed an illegal operation
   and will be shut down.

Clicking the Details button reports:

   

   MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in
   module MSVCSHL.DLL at 0137:5001d791.

Windows NT reports:

   

  msdev.exe - Application Error

  The instruction at "0x77F8879F" referenced memory at "0x0000001c".

The Bcprovc.pkg file that ships with Bounds Checker Professional or Bcstdvc.pkg
that ships with the standard version 3.0 is incompatible with Visual C++ 4.0.
