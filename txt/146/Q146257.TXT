TITLE   :XCLN: Screen Refresh Problems When Using the Color Dialog
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you modify the background colors of a form in Microsoft Exchange Electronic
Forms Designer (EFD), you might experience various screen refresh problems in
the Color dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you click on any of the basic colors in the Color dialog box for the
background color, a white frame might remain around each color that was
previously selected.

Also, if you select a basic color or move the color intensity arrow (located on
the far right side of the Color dialog box), the arrow might leave a white
background in the Color dialog box and fail to repaint to the original gray
color. In addition, the arrow for the color intensity scale might appear white,
instead of black.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
