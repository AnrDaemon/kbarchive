TITLE   :Recursive File Collection When SMS Performs Inventory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a large Systems Management Server site performs inventory of files, the
files are placed in the FILES.COL directory. When the site server performs a
local inventory of files, it cannot distinguish the files in the FILES.COL
directory. Therefore, the files are collected again, which creates extremely
large .MIF files. The creation of large .MIF files causes the SMS Executive
service to process for a long period of time (which causes backlogs of other
processes).

Each time the site server performs inventory, duplicate files are collected,
which creates duplicate .MIF files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Do not collect files

   -or-

 - Manually remove the collected files frequently to reduce the number of files

   -or-

 - Disable the Inventory Agent service on the site server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. It has been fixed in Systems Management Server version 1.2.
