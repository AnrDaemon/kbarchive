KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Because you can set appointments as Private, other users do not have access to
see the details of the private appointment. For example, if other users open
your calendar on a monthly view, they will see an asterisk (*) at certain places
indicating private appointments or notes.

However, if the same user opens your calendar on a daily view, the same asterisk
is not displayed. Instead, a key is displayed indicating the field is locked,
containing personal/private information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
