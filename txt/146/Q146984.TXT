TITLE   :XCLN: Minimized Msg Finder Windows Not Restored to Position
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Message Finder in the Microsoft Exchange client, you can
minimize the Find window so that when Microsoft Exchange is started the next
time, the Find window will be created. However, it is possible that the Find
window may not be restored in the same position it was in when you minimized it.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design. The Find window maintains its minimized position as
long as it does not conflict with any existing minimized windows. If there is a
conflict (checked each time a Find window is minimized), it takes the next
position, just like an application would, and the old position is lost forever.
