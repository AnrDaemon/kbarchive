SYMPTOMS
========

The Account Information dialog boxes appear gray when you are adding virtual
directories.

CAUSE
=====

This is normal behavior. The Account Information boxes only become active when a
universal naming convention (UNC) path is used for a virtual directory. For
example:

The Account Information is used to validate the connection from the Internet
Server to the share it is connecting to.
