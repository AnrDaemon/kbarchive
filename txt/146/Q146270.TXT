SUMMARY
=======

When a message is sent with Read Receipt enabled from the IMC Microsoft Exchange
client to a UNIX client, the Read Receipt is returned to the IMC client from the
Mail Delivery Subsystem (MAILER-DAEMON@Server.Domain.com) with the original
message as the embedded message. The embedded message does not contain a header
and the message body is suppressed.


The read receipt is returned by the Mail Delivery Subsystem. There is an embedded
message (the original message sent). Open that mail and notice that there is no
header for the original message and the "Message body is suppressed".

At the end of the Read Receipt message, part of the message content states
"Message header follows", but nothing follows it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IMC is doing no special processing on these messages. It is converting and
passing on whatever the remote system has chosen to send. This is part of the
Mailer-Deamon configuration option for handling NDRs and DRs.

Additional query words: return SMTP
