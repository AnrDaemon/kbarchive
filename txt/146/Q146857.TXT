TITLE   :XCLN: Moving Shared Folders Changes Ownership and Permissions
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Shared folders are moved by copying and deleting the original folder. Therefore,
the original permissions of the shared folders are lost. In addition, if a user
with administrator privileges moves a folder that is not owned by the user, the
user becomes the owner of the folder.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
4.0 clients. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ability to move folders is a new functionality in Exchange. Therefore, it is
important to remember the following:

 - Folder permissions are reset to the default Read and Write access when a
   folder is moved.

 - The ownership of a folder changes to the user who moved it.

 - Folders can only be moved or renamed by the Administrator or a user with
   administrator privileges.
