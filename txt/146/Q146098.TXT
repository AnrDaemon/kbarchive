TITLE   :XCLN: ClipArt Converted as Embedded Object Disappears
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you insert a ClipArt Gallery object into a message and convert it into an
icon, the object seems to disappear from the message. When you look more
closely, you can see a small handled object in the message roughly in the place
of the clipart object. However, this object cannot be selected.

If you send the message, the recipient looks at the message and will find a gap
in the previous location of the clipart object roughly the size of the icon. On
the received message, the blank object can be selected. If double-clicked,
ClipArt Gallery is launched and the original object is highligted.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Clipart Gallery. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
