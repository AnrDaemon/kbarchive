SYMPTOMS
========

The Error.log file located in the Program Files\Accessories\Log folder created
by Windows 95 Backup may contain garbage characters.

of the following conditions are true:

 - Some of the files or folders specified in the original backup no longer
   exist.

 - You do not have the necessary network access rights.

 - No changes have been made to the original files before running an incremental
   backup.

NOTE: If any of the above conditions are true when you attempt to perform an
incremental backup, you receive the following error message:

   Microsoft Backup could not find any files for this operation. Either the
   specified files or directory no longer exist, you do not have the necessary
   network access rights, or none of the selected files need to be backed up.
   This operation has been canceled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the garbage characters from the Error.log file, use either of the
following methods:

 - Manually delete the garbage characters by opening the file in any text editor
   (such as Notepad).

 - Click the Overwrite Old Status Log Files check box in Backup so that it is
   selected. To access the check box, click Options on the Settings menu in
   Backup, and then click the General tab.
