TITLE   :XFOR: No NDR When IMCDATA/OUT Directory Is Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the IMCDATA\OUT directory is removed while the Internet Mail Connector (IMC)
runs, messages disappear and the user is not informed that the messages are not
delivered. However, the IMC administrator receives the "Notification: Outbound
Mail Failure" error message.

In addition, the following appears in the Event Viewer:

   The following non-delivery report could not be delivered because the message
   could not be saved From: UserX Subject: Test Message Submit Time:
   <date> <time>

CAUSE
=====

If you remove the IMCDATA\OUT directory when the IMC is running, the directory
is re-created. The symptom above occurs if the IMCDATA\OUT directory is removed
after the IMC has successfully started. The "Notification: Outbound Mail
Failure" error message and the event log above indicates that the IMCDATA\OUT
directory is missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, the administrator must restart the IMC only. Notify the
users that they must send the messages again.
