PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0,4.1,4.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbide kbVC kbVC500fix kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify the working directory with a path that ends with a backslash
(\) or something like the following the debugger does not recognize the working
directory specified.

   c:
   c:\
   c:\.

It uses the default working directory. The debugger will recognize any valid path
that does not end with a backslash.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, do not include trailing backslashes in the Working
Directory field of the Debug, General settings. Also avoid using the paths
listed in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
