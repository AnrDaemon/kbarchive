SYMPTOMS
========

Diamond Stealth 64 2001 series video cards use the S3 trio64V+ chip set and are
not supported by the normal S3 video driver supplied with Windows NT. During
Windows NT Setup your computer may hang while performing the video test or later
while booting into Windows NT after the installation is complete.


WORKAROUND
==========

In Windows NT Setup, perform a custom installation. When the computer
configuration screen displays:

   Processor:
   video type:
   keyboard:
   keyboard layout:
   pointing device:

Manually change the video type from: "VGA or COMPATIBLE" to "STANDARD VGA
640x480x16 color" during the text portion of Windows NT Setup.


During the Graphical User Interface (GUI) portion of Setup, the display type will
be identified as a VGA Compatible - accept this choice and finish Windows NT
Setup.

After Windows NT is installed, from the Display section of Control Panel, choose
Change Display Type. Select the drivers provided by Diamond Multimedia systems
Inc. to install the correct drivers.
