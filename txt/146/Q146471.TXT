TITLE   :XCLN: Cannot Save Parameters of Electronic Forms

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you resize a Microsoft Exchange Electronic Form that is contained in a
message, there is no way to keep the changed size of the form. Any changes that
you make to a form's size will not be retained for future use.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. MAPI forms have no interface that allow us to specify a
location to open the form at or a way to save the parameters that a form's size
was changed to. There is no way of even telling if the form has been resized.
When forms are loaded, they will always default back to their initial size.
