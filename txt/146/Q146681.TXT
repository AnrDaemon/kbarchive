TITLE   :XFOR: DXA Improperly Appending 001 to Friendly Names in the GAL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you run Directory Synchronization (DirSync) between Microsoft Exchange
Server and Microsoft Mail (MSMail) Postoffices, with the Microsoft Exchange
Server as the DirSync Server, certain friendly names in the Global Address List
(GAL) on the MSMail side may have a 001 or 002 appended. These names are not
located on the local MSMail Postoffice. Though this is by design in the case of
duplicate mailbox or friendly names, which is explained in article Q146676, it
is not normal behavior in most other circumstance.

CAUSE
=====

The cause is in the logic behind determining when to add this appendage. There
are times when this appendage is necessary. Again, please reference article
Q146676.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
