TITLE   :Disk Access Light Blinks When CD Player Plays Audio CD
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer's hard disk access light may blink as you play an audio CD with
Microsoft CD Player.

CAUSE
=====

When CD Player plays an audio CD, it polls the CD-ROM drive for the current
track and location so that it can display the information in its status window.
Some computers turn on the hard disk access light whenever any SCSI device is
accessed, regardless of whether or not the device being accessed is the hard
disk. As a result, accessing the CD-ROM drive causes the hard disk access light
to blink.

RESOLUTION
==========

You do not need to take any action. However, if you want to play audio CDs
without CD Player running, follow these steps:

1. In CD Player, click Preferences on the Options menu.

2. Click the Stop Playing CD On Exit check box to clear it.

3. Click OK.

When the audio CD starts playing, quit CD Player. The audio CD will continue to
be played, but CD Player will not poll the CD-ROM drive for status information.
