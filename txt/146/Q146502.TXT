-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If Microsoft Schedule+ User1 sends a meeting request for a date in the future to
Microsoft Schedule+ User2 and then immediately sends another request to change
the time, User2 will receive two messages at same time and the Receive date and
time will be the same. There is no way to let User2 know which meeting time is
correct.

MORE INFORMATION
================

We can't tell a request is out of date until at least one of them has been
booked (or declined). There's no way to compare the two messages to each other,
only to something already on the schedule.

If the recipient accepts (or declines) both of them, only the latest one will be
booked.

For example, you make a meeting and then reschedule it 5 times in about 10
seconds. Recipients will receive these in a funny order and will have no idea
which one is the final request. If they simply open each one and Accept them
all, the final version is what will be booked on the schedule. Even if the final
one happens to be booked right away, the others will be out of date and will not
be booked.

The actual message at the top of the Microsoft Schedule+ message is "This meeting
is out of date[ASCII 148] and the Accept/Decline buttons will be gray.

Note: For quick information, User1 should include a message on the Subject line
indicating the change.
