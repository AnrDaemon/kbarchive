TITLE   :XCON: MTA: Invalid Originator Address When Sending to X.400
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message from Microsoft Mail through Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 to someone on an X.400 messaging system, a reply to this message may not be
possible. This occurs if you (the Microsoft Mail user) are not a Custom
Recipient on Microsoft Exchange Server, which can happen if, for example,
directory synchronization is not yet finished.

CAUSE
=====

The message will arrive at the remote X.400 system with an invalid X.400
originator address in the P1 header fields. The X.400 address will only contain
a DDA Type and a DDA Value, which contains the Microsoft Mail Address. For
example:

   DDA Type=MS;DDA Value=Net/PO/User

This address is invalid because mandatory parts are missing. A valid address
would look like this:

   C=Country;A=Admin;P=Private;O=Org;DDA Type=MS;DDA Value=Net/PO/User

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query
