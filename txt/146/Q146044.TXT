TITLE   :XCLN: Err Msg: The Set of Folders Could Not Be Opened...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear when you attempt to start up offline or
when you try to access a mailbox when working offline:

   The set of folders could not be opened. The information store could not be
   opened.

CAUSE
=====

There are several possible causes of this error message:

 - Offline store use has been disabled, but you start up offline.

 - After the first profile is created, Microsoft Exchange no longer prompts the
   user with the question "Do you travel with this computer?" Because of this,
   the offline store is not created automatically for new profiles even though
   they may be used offline. If Microsoft Exchange Server is started offline for
   any reason, the above error message will be displayed unless you manually
   create the offline store before starting offline.

WORKAROUND
==========

Restart the Microsoft Exchange client and work online, then go back to the
offline folder status button and specify the profile to use.
