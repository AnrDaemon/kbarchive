======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0, you may store your Schedule+ data file on a network
server. If you restore this file and the network connection is broken during the
restoration process, you may receive one of the following messages:

Windows 3.x
-----------

   There was a problem importing the file. An unknown error occurred.

Windows 95
----------

   There was a problem importing the file. The specified network path is not
   valid.

Windows NT
----------

   There was a problem importing the file. A problem occurred while connecting
   to the network. See your administrator.

Additional attempts to restore the file produce the following error:

   There was a problem importing the file. An unknown error occurred.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error occurs when the network connection to the client computer is
terminated unexpectedly. While the file is being restored, the file header and
information is cached. Terminating the network connection flushes the cached
information and it is not written to the file. Subsequent attempts to restore
the file cause the same error because the file header has been flushed.
