TITLE   :XADM: Cannot Disable Proxy Address Generators
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup kbusage exc4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 Administrator program, there are three
default e-mail proxy addresses installed by default: MSMail, X400, and SMTP.
These addresses are an integral part of the program and cannot be disabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot control the generation of proxy addresses for imported recipients or
newly created recipients. For example, when you create or import users, the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program automatically generates an X.400, a
Microsoft Mail, and an SMTP proxy address for each mailbox. You cannot force
Exchange Server to generate only one or two of the proxy addresses. The
Administrator program generates all three proxy addresses.

This behavior is by product design.

To find these addresses, click the Configuration container, open the Site
Addressing Container properties, and then click the Site Addressing tab. The
Remove button on this page can be used to remove a specific address type from
all existing mailboxes, but Exchange Server will generate all types of address
for new or imported mailboxes.
