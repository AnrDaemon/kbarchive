TITLE   :XADM: Generated SMTP Addresses for Duplicate Mailboxes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have multiple users with the same surname and given name, only the
first generated SMTP address uses the complete surname and given name
combination. All subsequently generated SMTP addresses use their alias and an
iteration number.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first time that a unique SMTP address is generated for a recipient, the
template information from the Configuration container, Site Addressing object,
and Site Addressing property page is used to generate the SMTP address. For
example, if you set up the SMTP site address to be %s.%g@company.com, the SMTP
address will be surname.givenname@company.com.

If you have two or more people with the same surname and given name, every
subsequent duplicate name uses the alias for that person and an appended
iteration number. For example, the next person with the same name ends up with
an SMTP address of:

   gsurname2@company.com

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
