TITLE   :XCLN: Unread Message Count Not Updated Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you create a second instance of the same Personal Folder (PST) in one profile
and copy a message to one of them, the unread message count will only be updated
correctly in one of the Personal Folders.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Basically, what you are doing is creating two Personal Folders that point to the
same file. Exiting the Microsoft Exchange client and logging back in will update
the unread message counts correctly, but you will have to do this every time a
change is made to the folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft Exchange does not support having multiple stores in one profile point
to the same file. This is by design.
