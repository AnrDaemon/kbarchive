SYMPTOMS
========

The following DAO error 3028 may occur when you try to create a workspace DAO
object:

   Can't start application. The system database is missing or opened
   exclusively by another user.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur if you have failed to specify a system database or have
assigned the system database after performing operations with the database
engine.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is important that the SystemDB property of the database engine be set prior
to performing any operations with the database engine. If you are using the
dbDAO C++ classes included with the DAO SDK, you can set the system database by
using code similar to this code:

      // get database engine object but don't fill its collections
      CdbDBEngine eng(FALSE, FALSE);

      // set the system database
      eng.SetSystemDB(_T("d:\\work\\sectest.mdw"));

      // Finish initializing the engine object
      eng.Start();

      CdbWorkspace wsp;

      // The following function call will generate the 3028
      // error if a System Database hasn't been assigned or if the
      // second argument of the constructor for CdbDBEngine didn't
      // receive FALSE.

      wsp= eng.CreateWorkspace(_T("Test"),_T("MyUserName"),
                               _T("MyPassword"));

Or, alternately, use the CdbDBEngine::SetInitPath() method before opening or
creating a CdbWorkspace object.

If you are using the MFC DAO classes, use code similar to this code:

      //Initialize global MFC DAO engine
      AfxDaoInit( );
      DAODBEngine* pDBEngine = AfxDaoGetEngine( );

      // Set up system database
      COleVariant var( _T("d:\\work\\sectest.mdw"), VT_BSTRT );
      // NOTE: put_SystemDB was a late addition to DAO
      // and is not yet wrapped by MFC
      DAO_CHECK( pDBEngine->put_SystemDB( var.bstrVal ) );

      CDaoWorkspace wsp;
      wsp.Create(_T("Test"),_T("MyUserName"), _T("MyPassword"));

Or, alternately, use the CDaoWorkspace::SetInitPath() method before opening or
creating a CDaoWorkspace object.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
