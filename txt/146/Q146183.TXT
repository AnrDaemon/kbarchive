TITLE   :XADM: Optimizer Deletes Edb*.log Files When Given Invalid Path
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Optimizer to move the Information Store or
Directory Service transaction logs from one drive to another (for example,
d:\exchsrvr\mdbdata to c:\exchsrvr\mdbdata), and you specify an invalid path in
the directory box (for example, d:MDBDATA.LOG ), the Edb.log file and any
corresponding E Bxxxxx.log files will be deleted.

When the Exchange Optimizer tries to restart either the Directory Service or
Information Store service, it will take a long time to time out and finally
respond with the following error message:

   The service could not be started. It did not respond to in a timely manner.
   -[800FF351]

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Optimizer goes into an unstable state when a invalid path
is entered into the transaction log file path dialog. This is an error condition
that is not checked.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Microsoft Exchange Optimizer was fixed to validate the path entered in the
file dialog box for the transaction logs and will generate a pop-up error dialog
box if the path entered fails this validation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
