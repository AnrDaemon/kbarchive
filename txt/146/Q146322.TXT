SUMMARY
=======

When you use Exchange Administrator to change Address Templates on the Exchange
server, you can see the changes only in the Test window on the server or from an
Exchange client.

If you switch to the Recipients container in Microsoft Exchange Administrator and
select a user mailbox, you can see only the original template. This is correct
Microsoft Exchange Administrator functionality.
