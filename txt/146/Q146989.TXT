TITLE   :XCLN: Views: Group By and Sort Have Same Property Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a new view for a folder, Exchange will not allow you to create a
Sort By criteria on a column already defined in the Group By dialog box.
Attempting to do so returns the following error:

   The grouping you specified is not valid. You cannot sort on a property that
   you are using to group by.

Completely removing the column that is currently defined by a valid Sort By
criteria causes the Sort By dialog box to be populated with another column
defined in your Group By dialog box. This, in effect, contradicts the previous
error message because it defines a Sort By property that you are using to group
by. No error message is returned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange version
4.0 Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT clients. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
