SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Netsetup.exe to create a network installation of Windows 95
on a Windows 95-based or Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 Server-based computer, you
may receive the following error messages:

 - Server setup. Error creating batch script.

 - Error happened while writing one or more entries to MSBATCH.INF.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if you specify a directory name in the Server Path box in
Netsetup.exe that is more than eight characters long.

RESOLUTION
==========

Specify a directory name of no more than eight characters in the Server Path
box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs whether or not you have already created the directory.
Netsetup.exe generates no error messages when it creates the directory, it
simply truncates extra characters. For example, the directory name D:\win95_flat
is truncated to D:\win95_fl.
