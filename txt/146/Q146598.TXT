The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) service stops running and
messages are stuck in the IMC OUT queue.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Messages that have two attachments with the same name, when the attachment names
are either "" or beginning with '.', can cause the IMC to crash. This kills the
thread and causes the message to get stuck in the IMC OUT queue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
