TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Messages Left in \Imcdata\Out Directory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) fails to resolve the
destination host for a message because the chain of CNAME records is greater
that eight records long, the message will not be returned with a Non-Delivery
Report (NDR). Instead, it will sit in the \Imcdata\Out subdirectory in retry
mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a chain of CNAME records from a sample DNS server:

   cname0of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   cname1of8.test.microsoft.com.
   cname1of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   cname2of8.test.microsoft.com.
   cname2of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   cname3of8.test.microsoft.com.
   cname3of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   cname4of8.test.microsoft.com.
   cname4of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   cname5of8.test.microsoft.com.
   cname5of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   cname6of8.test.microsoft.com.
   cname6of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   cname7of8.test.microsoft.com.
   cname7of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   cname8of8.test.microsoft.com.
   cname8of8.test.microsoft.com.   IN CNAME
   test.microsoft.com.

If you compose a message to user@cname0of8.test.microsoft.com, the message will
not be NDR'd. The message will sit in the \Imcdata\Out subdirectory in the retry
mode. If you check the status of the message, it will report that there was a
network error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
