-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are a Delegate Owner and you restore the backup copy of another user's
Microsoft Schedule+ file, the local file is not synchronized with the file on
the Microsoft Exchange server.

CAUSE
=====

Normally, when you log on to Microsoft Schedule+, the local file is synchronized
with the server file. If you restore another user's file from the server, the
link between the user's local copy and the server copy is broken and
synchronization is disabled.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, force synchronization using the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Synchronize tab.

2. Click Synchronize Now.

3. Click OK.
