The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When a user tries to restore an archive file while the Microsoft Exchange Server
is shut down, the user will receive the following error message:

   Your schedule may have been only partially synchronized. Try again later. A
   problem occurred while connecting to the network. See your administrator.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design because restoring from an archive while the Microsoft
Exchange Server was shut down could result in duplicate items. If the user would
like to access the archive file, they can open it by clicking File, Open,
Archive or Project Schedule, and choosing the archive file.
