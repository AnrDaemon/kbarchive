TITLE   :Exception Does Not Inherit Properties of Series
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When one user makes a recurring appointment with a second user, and the second
user makes this recurring appointment private and tentative, the second user's
private instance shows an accepted appointment and the first user's instance of
this same appointment shows it as tentative.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design; an exception to a recurring appointment does not inherit any
properties of the series.


Additional query words: 7.00 schedule plus
