TITLE   :XCLN: Open Copy of Message Doesn't Close When Source Deleted
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the source of an open message is deleted from the Microsoft Exchange
Viewer, the open message does not automatically close.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design.

Microsoft Exchange no longer closes open notes when they are moved or deleted
from other sources. Microsoft Exchange is a multi-document interface (MDI), and
each opened message opens into its own separate autonomous form called a Read
Note.
