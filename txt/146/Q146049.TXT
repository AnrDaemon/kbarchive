PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have been given access to another user's Schedule+ version 1.0 calendar
file, you will lose access to the file when the user updates to Schedule+
version 7.0.


CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Schedule+ cannot migrate the permissions between the two
versions of Schedule+.

Additional query words: 7.00
