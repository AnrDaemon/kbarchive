SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible to use AppWizard to create an OLE Custom Control (.ocx file) that
subclasses a standard Windows control. If you choose to subclass an edit
control, the control will not exhibit the same behavior as a standard edit
control.

Specifically, in the case where the control is not initialized with data, the
user types some text into the control, and then SetWindowText(NULL) is called to
clear the text, the text in the control will not be cleared. If this same
sequence of events were to occur in a standard edit control, the contents of the
edit control would be cleared.

CAUSE
=====

COleControl handles the WM_SETTEXT message in its OnSetText handler. The first
few lines of this function are:

   LRESULT COleControl::OnSetText(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
   {
      ASSERT(lParam == 0 || AfxIsValidString((LPCTSTR)lParam));
      // Is the property changing?
      if ((lParam == 0 && m_strText.IsEmpty()) ||
         (lParam != 0 && m_strText == (LPCTSTR)lParam))
         return 0;
              .
            .
            .
   }

When a user types text into the control, the m_strText member is not updated.
Therefore, when SetWindowText(NULL) is called on the control, the first
expression is evaluated as TRUE, even though the edit control is not truly
empty. This expression is interpreted as property not changed, and the function
exits.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, override OnSetText() in the COleControl derived
class, and copy the code from COleControl::OnSetText() into the overridden
funtion, with the following change:

   LRESULT CMyOleControl::OnSetText(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
   {
      ASSERT(lParam == 0 || AfxIsValidString((LPCTSTR)lParam));
      // Is the property changing?
      if ((lParam == 0 && InternalGetText().IsEmpty()) ||
         (lParam != 0 && m_strText == (LPCTSTR)lParam))
         return 0;
                       .
            .
            .
   }

Calling InternalGetText() will give access to the text property, and then calling
IsEmpty() on the return from it will correctly check to see if the edit control
has been updated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ 32-bit
Edition, version 4.2.
