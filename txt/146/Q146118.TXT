TITLE   :PRB: Duplicate Column Appears in Combo or List Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Setting the RowSourceType of a combo box or list box to 6-Fields or 2-Alias and
then either concatenating the first two fields together or using a function,
such as UPPER(), on the first field causes the object to duplicate the data from
the first column into the second column.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use an SQL-ELECT statement to select the data before placing it in the object
when you want to concatenate fields or use functions with data. For example, the
following SQL-SELECT statement places the city and phone fields into the first
column and the postalcode field into the second column:

      SELECT city+phone,postalcode FROM customer INTO CURSOR TEMP

You need to type this SQL-SELECT statement into the RowSource property, and
change the RowSourceType to 3-SQL Statement.

You can also place certain functions (such as UPPER, LTRIM, and RTRIM) in a
SQL-SELECT statement. However, other functions, like SUBSTR(), give an error
when placed in a SQL-SELECT statement.

Another option is to use an array or the AddItem method to populate the combo box
or list box. For more information about populating an object by using the
AddItem method, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   Q137183 How to Add Items to a Multiple-Column Combo Box

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form called test.

2. Add the Customer table from the TestData database located in the Samples\Data
   subdirectory under Visual FoxPro to the Data Environment.

3. Place a combo box on the form.

4. In the properties sheet of the Combo box, set the following properties:

   BoundColumn = 2
   ColumnCount = 2
   ColumnWidths = 150,150
   RowSource = city+phone,postalcode
   RowSourceType = Fields

5. Run the form. The combo box duplicates the data from the first column to the
   second column in every row. The second field does not appear.
