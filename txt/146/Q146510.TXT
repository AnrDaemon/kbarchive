SUMMARY
=======

Here are general descriptions of the OAB files:

Tmplts.oab = Strings for dialog boxes and anything that is static per OAB and not
per object. Therefore, it doesn't increase if you just add additional objects to
your directory.

Details.oab = Contains all the object details (those that were included in
generation of the OAB) except for display name.

Browse.oab = This is the core file. It contains the object type, display name,
and a pointer into the Details.oab for each object.

Rdndex.oab = Index for resolving Relative Distinguished Names.

Anrdex.oab = Index for resolving Ambiguous Names.
