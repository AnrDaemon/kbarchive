SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to implement the standard OK, Cancel, and Apply
buttons in a modeless CPropertySheet object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a modeless CPropertySheet, the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) resize the
sheet and hide the standard buttons in the CPropertySheet::OnInitDialog member
function. To prevent MFC from doing this, perform the following steps:

 - Derive a class from CPropertySheet and override the OnInitDialog function.

 - Set "m_bModeless" to FALSE and remove the WF_CONTINUEMODAL style for
   "m_nFlags".

 - Call CPropertySheet::OnInitDialog.

 - Set "m_bModeless" back to TRUE and add the style WF_CONTINUEMODAL to
   "m_nFlags".

The following sample code illustrates this technique:

   // CMySheet is derived from CpropertySheet.
   // Compile options needed: default.
       
   BOOL CMySheet::OnInitDialog()
   {
      m_bModeless = FALSE;   
      m_nFlags |= WF_CONTINUEMODAL;

      BOOL bResult = CPropertySheet::OnInitDialog();

      m_bModeless = TRUE;
      m_nFlags &= ~WF_CONTINUEMODAL;
      return bResult;
   }

In a modeless CPropertySheet object, the OK and Cancel buttons do not close the
property sheet when they are clicked. They do send a WM_COMMAND message with
IDOK or IDCANCEL to the sheet, and the OnOK or OnCancel functions are called for
the page. To close the sheet, you can implement ON_COMMAND handlers for IDOK and
IDCANCEL in the CPropertySheet and call the EndDialog function to close the
sheet.
