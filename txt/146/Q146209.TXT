TITLE   :XCLN: Printing Excel Attachments Requires User Input
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you receive a mail message with an embedded Microsoft Excel attachment, you
can print the message and attachment at the same time by selecting the Print
Attachments options.

However, when Microsoft Excel opens and loads the attachment to print, its print
dialog appears and waits for your input. You must select the OK button on the
Microsoft Excel dialog box to allow the print job to continue.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Excel 97 does not exhibit this problem running with either Microsoft
Exchange 4.0 or 5.0.
