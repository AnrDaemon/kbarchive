TITLE   :Sound Card Beeps During Hardware Detection

PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Windows 95 on a computer with a sound card, the sound
card may beep intermittently during the hardware detection portion of Setup.

CAUSE
=====

Setup may leave the sound card in an unsteady state during the hardware
detection portion if the sound card is set to use a non-standard I/O range.

RESOLUTION
==========

Typically, the beeps cease shortly after hardware detection is finished. In some
cases, however, the computer may stop responding (hang), requiring you to
restart the computer. In either case, run Setup again and choose Safe Recovery
when you are prompted.

After you run Setup, set the sound card for a standard I/O range and install the
drivers, if available, using the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel.

For information about setting the sound card to a standard I/O range, please
refer to the sound card's documentation or manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may also encounter the behavior described in this article if you install a
new sound card and run the automatic hardware detection routine in an existing
installation of Windows 95.
