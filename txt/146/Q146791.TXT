TITLE   :XFOR: IMC Cannot Receive Message with Missing Folder
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run low on disk space, or if you rename or remove the IN directory while
the Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) is running, inbound SMTP mail
messages are not accepted and the following error message may appear:

   421 Internal Error. Connection Closing.

In addition, if you stop and restart the IMC service in Control Panel Services,
the following error message appears and the IMC service stops:

   Could not stop the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector on \\<Server
   Name>

   0008: Not enough storage space is available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, stop and restart the IMC service. The IMC recreates the
IN directory upon startup. The default working directory is EXCHSRVR\IMCDATA\IN.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Internet Mail Connector must have access to the IN directory while the
service is running. If the directory is removed, inbound SMTP calls may be
refused. If a call is accepted, the mail will be rejected with the following
Event Log error:

  Event ID:   4055
