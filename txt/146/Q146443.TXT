TITLE   :PRB: Msmask32.ocx Does Not Work Properly in MFC Containers
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole kbCtrl kbprb

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Masked Edit Control's Format property is set, it does not automatically
format its contents upon losing focus. When embedded in a Visual Basic 4.0 form
or Microsoft Access 7.0 form, the control automatically formats its contents
when the control loses focus.

CAUSE
=====

The Masked Edit Control uses a proprietary Visual Basic interface called
IVBFormat. The absence of IVBFormat support in a control container prevents the
Masked Edit Control from automatically updating its contents as specified by the
Format property. Control containers created with Visual C++ do not support
IVBFormat. Other control containers, such as Visual FoxPro 3.0 forms, which do
not support this interface, will also experience limited functionality from the
Masked Edit Control.

RESOLUTION
==========

The IVBFormat interface is proprietary and subject to change. Documentation or
specifications for this interface are not available. The Masked Edit Control can
be used in a Visual C++ control container application, but the automatic
formatting feature will remain disabled. Other properties such as the control's
Mask property, will function properly in the absence of IVBFormat support.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
