TITLE   :WD97: Selecting Multiple File Names Gives Run-time Error 5174
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select multiple file names from the Open dialog box and then click the
Open button, the following error message appears:

   Run-time error '5174'

   This file could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

The Open dialog box from which you selected the file names is being displayed by
a macro using the wdDialogFileOpen built-in Word dialog box.

   Dialogs(wdDialogFileOpen).Show

You can select a single file and open it, but selecting multiple files at one
time causes the error message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot select multiple files form the built-in Open dialog box in Word when
displayed programmatically. This lack of functionality is by design in the
previous and present versions of Word.

When you record a macro in Microsoft Word of opening multiple files form the Open
dialog box the result is a series of statments:

   Documents.Open FileName:=<filename1>
   Documents.Open FileName:=<filename2>
   Documents.Open FileName:=<filename3>

This is the functionality of the Word Visual Basic for Applications constant
wdDialogFileOpen which is different from Microsoft Excel Open dialog box
functionality.
