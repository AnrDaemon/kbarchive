TITLE   :XFOR: No Events Logged when the IMC Refuses Inbound Connection
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Connector (IMC) does not log an event if it detects an attempt
to open an inbound connection (log level 1, category SMTP Interface, type
warning).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by product design. There are currently no events logged when
the IMC refuses inbound connections when it is configured for outbound- only
operation.
