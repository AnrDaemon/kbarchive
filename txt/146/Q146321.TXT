SUMMARY
=======

In addition to administering a Microsoft Exchange Server in your domain, it
might be necessary to administer a Microsoft Exchange Server in an untrusted
domain (when setting up a site connector, for example). This can be accomplished
by creating identical accounts (username and password) in both domains and
making sure that this account has the necessary permissions on the Microsoft
Exchange objects.

If you have two domains, EAST and WEST, and they do not trust each other, create
an EXADMIN account with a password of EXADMIN in both domains. On the Microsoft
Exchange Servers in those domains, give EXADMIN administrative privileges in the
Organization, Site and Configuration containers. Once this is done, you will be
able to connect to and administer both Microsoft Exchange Servers when logged in
as EXADMIN.
