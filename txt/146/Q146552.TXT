TITLE   :XCLN: Revision Marks in Word Document are not Updated in PFs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you make a revision to a Microsoft Word document in a Microsoft Exchange
Public Folder (PF), the revision number will not be incremented in the PF.

NOTE: This only occurs with the Microsoft Exchange clients for Windows 95 and
Windows NT running Word 95 or Word 97. When using Word 97, the properties of the
open document are reflected properly, but the Microsoft Exchange Public Folder
document is still not updated properly.

The Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x, running Word 6.x, works fine.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If a Microsoft Word document is created and placed in a PF, any revisions made
to the document are not noted in the PF. If a document is opened in Microsoft
Word, the Properties will not show any revisions because it is not the same copy
of the document that was in the PF previously. If Update from the File menu is
selected in Word, the Properties tab in Word will reflect the same number of
revisions as in the PF. This will occur even if the revision number was correct
in Word.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of Microsoft
Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
