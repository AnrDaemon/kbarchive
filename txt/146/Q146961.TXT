TITLE   :XCLN: Outbox on Win16 Client Does Not Change Color
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message is sent from the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x,
running WIN 16 TCP/IP, on a Microsoft LAN Manager network, the Outbox will
change color indicating that a message is waiting to be sent. Once the message
has been sent, the Outbox will not revert back to its original (empty) color
until another folder has been selected.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because Microsoft Exchange does not support "push" notification on
LAN Manager networks.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0
Windows client. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


Additional query words: push outbox lanman
