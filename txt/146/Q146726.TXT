TITLE   :ErrMsg: File .IDC Could Not Be Found

SYMPTOMS
========

The following Error message appears on your web browser when you try to access
an .IDC (Internet Database Connector) file on an Internet Information Server
(IIS):

   'file:c:\scripts/samples/viewbook.idc?' could not be found.
   The attempt to load 'file:c:\scripts/samples/viewbook.idc?' failed.

CAUSE
=====

Web Browsers send requests to IIS to access its databases. These queries are
conveyed in .IDC files. The .IDC file passes the request to database through the
file, HTTPODBC.DLL. Database results are then sent back to the client in a .HTX
file.

The .IDC file passes the request to HTTPODBC.DLL only if the request is received
over the HTTP protocol. If you use the following syntax to access the .IDC file,
IIS sends the content of the .IDC file back to the Web Browser, instead of the
results from the database query.

File:///c:\<directory path>/viewbook.idc

RESOLUTION
==========

Use HTTP to access an .IDC file. For example:

   http://<path>/viewbook.idc?
