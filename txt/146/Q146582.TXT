======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install or upgrade client computers for Systems Management Server and
the Setup verification reaches 20 to 22 percent, the client computer reboots.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you use CLI_DOS.EXE, CLI_OS2.EXE or CLI_NT.EXE and the
BIOS shadowing (or CMOS equivalent) is enabled on the computer.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, disable the main BIOS shadowing, system shadowing
or main-board shadowing on your computer. The type of shadowing used on your
computer depends on the BIOS manufacturer and version. For more information on
the BIOS type, contact your hardware manufacturer.
