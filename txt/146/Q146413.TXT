TITLE   :Japanese Characters Not Displayed Correctly in BBS Author List
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.2,1.3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbmsn

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 1.2, 1.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Japanese version of MSN, The Microsoft Network, and you post a
bulletin board (BBS) message, the Japanese characters in your name may not be
correctly displayed in the Author list.

CAUSE
=====

The name in the BBS Author list is taken from the address book, which does not
store your member data in Unicode. When the BBS asks for your member name, the
name is received in ASCII. The name is not displayed correctly because the
correct code page information is not available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in The Microsoft Network. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: msn bbs
