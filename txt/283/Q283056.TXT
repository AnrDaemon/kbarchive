IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 client
software, you may receive the following error message:

   Unable to load your profile, please contact your administrator.

This error message is displayed on the screen after the current user has logged
on to the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the "default user" profile has either been replaced
with a preconfigured profile or has been corrupted. This behavior can cause the
SMS client software to be unable to make the security changes to the protected
storage key when it attempts to create a new user profile for one of the SMS
client software accounts, the SMSCliToknAcct$ account.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this behavior, use one of the following three methods:

 - Ignore the errors on the client. The profile is able to load despite the
   errors. The errors occur only during SMS client installation. Most computers
   report this behavior only one time. After the installation has completed, the
   profile loads properly. The SMS client also runs properly. Subsequent logon
   attempts do not report the profile load error.

 - For each computer that exhibits this behavior:
   1. Connect to the admin share, or log on locally to the affected computer.

   2. Load and edit the permissions in the "default user" Ntuser.dat file. To
      perform this step, you must load the Ntuser.dat file as a registry hive:
      a. Start Regedt32.exe.

      b. Click the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive.

      c. On the Registry menu, click Load Hive.

      d. Specify the Ntuser.dat file at the %Systemroot%\Profiles\Default User
         folder on the affected computer.

      e. You are asked to specify a "key name." This key name is used to
         identify the hive that you are loading and is a subkey of
         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Enter any name that is not already in use.

      f. Locate HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/<Key Name>/Software/Microsoft/Protected
         Storage System Provider/<Sid>. The security identifier (SID) is
         for the user who created the profile that had been copied to the
         default user (for example,
         S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-123456789-1001). The SID can be
         unavailable because you do not have permission to access this key.
         Click this key. On the Security menu, click Permissions, and then add
         the group "Everyone" with full control access.

      g. Click the key name. On the Registry menu, click Unload.

 - Replace the Ntuser.dat file or the entire user profile for "default user"
   with an unmodified copy from another computer. This step, however, is not
   recommended because a new user can lose the benefit of obtaining a
   preconfigured default profile.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default user profile is located in the %Systemroot%\Profiles\Default User
folder. When a new user logs on, the computer copies the "default user" profile
to the new users profile folder under the %Systemroot%\Profiles\<Username>
folder. You may be unable to make the security changes to the protected storage
key when the preconfigured (default user) profile is used to create a new
profile for the SMSCLiToknAcct$ account.

The registry key is located at:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Protected Storage System
   Provider/<Sid>

NOTE: The preceding registry key is one path; the key may have been wrapped for
readability.

To confirm this behavior, enable userenv logging as discussed in the following
article:

   Q154120 Debugging User Profiles and System Policies in Windows NT 4.0

The output from the logging can be similar to the following output:

   C:\Winnt\Profiles\Smsclitoknacct\Ntuser.dat
   CopyProfileDirectory: Leaving with a return value of 1
   IssueDefaultProfile: Leaving successfully
   RestoreUserProfile: Successfully setup the local default.
   SetupNewHive: Entering
   ApplySecurityToRegistryKey : Failed to open subkey
   S-1-5-21-1283131943-1217870647-1252928729-500, error = 5
   ApplySecurityToRegistryKey : Failed to apply security to subkey Protected
   Storage System Provider, error = 5
   ApplySecurityToRegistryKey : Failed to apply security to subkey Microsoft,
   error = 5
   ApplySecurityToRegistryKey : Failed to apply security to subkey Software,

   SetupNewHive: Failed to apply security to user registry tree, error = 5
   SetupNewHive: Leaving with a return value of 0
   RestoreUserProfile: SetupNewHive failed
   RestoreUserProfile: About to Leave. Final Information follows:
   ApplySecurityToRegistryKey : Failed to open subkey
   S-1-5-21-1283131943-1217870647-1252928729-500, error = 5
   ApplySecurityToRegistryKey : Failed to apply security to subkey Protected
   Storage System Provider, error = 5

The SID that is listed, S-1-5-21-1283131943-1217870647-1252928729-500, belongs to
the local administrator account because the administrator had been the user that
created the profile, which had been copied to the default user profile during
the operating system installation. An error occurred after the operating system
copied the profile from the default user to the new user account (SMSClitokn$,
in this scenario) and attempted to change the permissions on the protected
storage key.
