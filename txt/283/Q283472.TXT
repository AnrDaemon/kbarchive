SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a secondary site server on a Windows 2000-based server that is
also running Terminal Services in Remote Administrator mode, an event ID 7031
message may be reported in the application event log on the computer immediately
after you install the server. The following event description is reported:

   The SMS_BOOTSTRAP service terminated unexpectedly. It has done this 1
   time(s). The following corrective action will be taken in 0 milliseconds. No
   action.

A second, similar event message is reported when you remove the secondary site.
These events are reported by the Service Control Manager.

WORKAROUND
==========

This event message can be safely ignored. This message does not represent an
error condition and does not impair secondary site server operation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
