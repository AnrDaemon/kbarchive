MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 54: Thicknet Cable Does Not Use BNC Connectors
---------------------------------------------------

On page 54, in the last paragraph, make the following corrections in the first
sentence.

Change:
"Both thinnet and thicknet cable use a connection component, known as a BNC
connector, to make the connections between the cable and the computers."

To:
"Thinnet cable uses a connection component, known as a BNC connector, to make the
connections between the cable and the computers."


Page 59: Category 3 And Category 4 Transmission Rates Are Incorrect
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 59 the description of Category 3 and Category 4 lists an incorrect data
transmission rate. Category 3 lists 16 Mbps and should read 10 Mbps. Category 4
lists 20 Mbps and should read 16 Mbps.

Change:
"Category 3 This category certifies UTP cable for data transmission up to 16
Mbps. It consists of...
Category 4 This category certifies UTP cable for data transmission up to 20 Mbps.
It consists of..."

To:
"Category 3 This category certifies UTP cable for data transmission up to 10
Mbps. It consists of...
Category 4 This category certifies UTP cable for data transmission up to 16 Mbps.
It consists of..."


Pages 72 & 101: BNC Connector Is Used Only With Thinnet
-------------------------------------------------------

On pages 72 and 101 in bullet number 5, change:
"The BNC connector is used with both thinnet and thicknet cables."

To:
"The BNC connector is used with thinnet cables."


Page 195: Figure 4.6 Shows Windows 95 And AppleTalk
---------------------------------------------------

On page 195, last sentence,

Change:
"For example, in the network shown in Figure 4.6, a Windows NT server is
supporting three clients: one computer is running Microsoft Windows 95, another
is running UNIX, and a third is running AppleTalk."

To:
"For example, in the network shown in Figure 4.6, a Windows NT server is
supporting two clients: one computer is running Microsoft Windows 95, the other
is running AppleTalk."


Page 209: Spell-out for ISO Is Incorrect
----------------------------------------

On page 209, in the first paragraph change:
"In 1978, the International Standards Organization (ISO) released..."

To:
"In 1978, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released..."


Page 212: Second Paragraph Should Be Under Application Layer
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 212, under the "Presentation Layer" section, the second paragraph should
be moved to the end of the "Application Layer" section on page 211.

Move the following paragraph:
"The redirector, which redirects input/output (I/O) operations to resources on a
server, operates at this layer. Redirectors are discussed in Chapter 8,
'Designing and Installing a Network'"


Page 222, Table 5.1: LLC and MAC Are Not Discussed In The Previous Lesson
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 222, Table 5.2, in the Description field of 802.2, remove "(discussed in
the previous lesson)". LLC and MAC are not discussed in the previous lesson.
They are discussed on page 223.


Page 241: OSI Model In Figure 6.3 Contains Errors
-------------------------------------------------

Figure 6.3 on page 241 contains two errors:

Under Internet Protocol Suite, TCP should be in the Transport layer of the OSI
model and IP should be in the Network layer of the OSI model. Also, under
Netware, SPX should be in the Transport layer of the OSI model and IPX should be
in the Network layer of the OSI model.


Page 273 & 276: Start and Stop Are Transposed In Figures
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 273 in Figure 7.5, and on page 276 in Figure 7.6 the positions of "start"
and "stop" are transposed.


Page 349: Incorrect Description Of Illustration
-----------------------------------------------

On page 349, Figure 8.5 shows a 24-connection, not a 12-connection, patch panel.

Change:
"Figure 8.5 shows a typical 12-connection CAT 5 568B patchpanel. Notice that the
front of the panel has 12 RJ-45 connectors. On the back is a terminal for each
of the 12 cables."

To:
"Figure 8.5 shows a typical 24-connection CAT 5 568B patchpanel. Notice that the
front of the panel has 24 RJ-45 connectors. On the back is a terminal for each
of the 24 cables."

Also, in the caption of Figure 8.5, change:
"Figure 8.5 12-connection CAT 5 568B Patch Panel"

To:
"Figure 8.5 24-connection CAT 5 568B Patch Panel"
