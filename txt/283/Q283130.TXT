======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an advertisement runs when the Client Configuration Installation Manager
(CCIM) verify cycle is initiated (usually once, approximately every 30 days),
the running advertisement may be interrupted and no error messages, such as,
10006, or 10007, are generated on the client indicating that the advertisement
did not work.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when CCIM attempts to perform the verification process
which interrupts the Systems Management Server Advertised Programs Manager
(Smsapm32). When this situation occurs, the software distribution that is
currently in progress is abruptly stopped. If the software installation is
interrupted prematurely, unpredictable results can occur. In some cases, the
advertisement is rescheduled and installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the Cliverify.exe utility that is specific
to the Service Pack level of your site hierarchy. You can use this utility to
manually configure or to disable the verification cycle.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must resend the advertisement that did not work.
