SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a printer in Windows 2000 that is defined as an LPR printer, a job
can be lost if the LPR print monitor (Lprmon) receives a "NACK" response after
the data file is sent. This can occur if the destination computer is UNIX-based
and the /var folder is full.

CAUSE
=====

Lprmon does not check for the status from the server after sending the data
file.
