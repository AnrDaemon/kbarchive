TITLE   :SMS: Hardware Inventory Reports Wrong Disk Size in Windows 95/98
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Hardware Inventory to obtain
hard disk parameters on clients that are running Microsoft Windows 95 or
Microsoft Windows 98 and have a hard disk that is larger than 8 gigabytes (GB),
the size is reported as 8 GB regardless of the actual disk size.

CAUSE
=====

SMS 2.0 clients are installed with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
version 698 by default. This version of WMI uses standard INT13 calls to query
the disk size. INT13 calls have a known limitation of 7.8 GB.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, install WMI version 1.5 (build 1085) on the clients
that are running Windows 95 or Windows 98. WMI 1.5 uses INT13 Extensions to
query the disk parameters and reports the disk size correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
