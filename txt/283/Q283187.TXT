TITLE   :RASEnumConnection() Function Doesn't List Multiple RAS Connects
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix kbWinNTsearch

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The RasEnumConnections function does not return properly formatted information
when you have multiple connections to a Remote Access Server (RAS). The
RasEnumConnections function returns data on the first connection, but does not
return data on subsequent RAS connections. This problem occurs when you use a
unicode version of the RasEnumConnections function (the RasEnumConnectionsW
function and the RASCONNW structure).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there is a problem in the unicode conversion in the
RasEnumConnectionsW function.
