TITLE   :Proxy 2.Server Has Two Different Files for the IP Filter Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbtool kbDriver

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add or remove a processor from Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0, you
may receive the following error message:

   Error: C:\Winnt\System32\Drivers\Ipfltdrv.sys
   Device Driver could not be loaded. 0xC000024.

The preceding message occurred when a processor had been added to the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when a processor is added or removed from an existing
Proxy Server 2.0, and then you start up the system. The location in the system's
memory that records where an access violation occurs, varies depending on
whether a processor has been installed or has been removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, you must validate the size of the Ipfltdrv.sys file
(the IP filter driver).

To Add a Processor:
-------------------

When you add a processor to a computer, replace the file with the multi-processor
version of the file. Then shut down your computer, add the hardware, and then
restart your computer.

To Remove a Processor:
----------------------

When you remove a processor from a computer, replace the file with the applicable
(a single-processor or a multi-processor) version of the file. Then shut down
your computer, remove the hardware, and restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Proxy Server has two different files named Ipfltdrv.sys. The following version
number is the same for both files: 4.4.372.12. The only method you have to
identify the difference in the files is to examine the size of the file.

The i386 single-processor version is 36 KB in size and is located on the Proxy
Server 2.0 CD-ROM in the Msproxy\I386\Routing\Up folder.
Size: 35.2 KB (36,048 bytes)

The i386 multiple-processor version is 34 KB in size and is located on the Proxy
Server 2.0 CD-ROM in the Msproxy\I386\Routing folder.
Size: 33.6 KB (34,416 bytes)

The Alpha single-processor version is 36 KB in size and is located on the Proxy
Server 2.0 CD-ROM in the Msproxy\I386\Routing\Up folder.
Size: 52.1 (53,424 bytes)
