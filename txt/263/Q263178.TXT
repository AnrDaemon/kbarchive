TITLE   :Err Msg: CAPI: The Install Failed. Rsabase.dll Doesn't Match
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOSWin2000

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Windows NT Service Pack (SP4) as a prerequisite to the
install of the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP), the following error message may
occur:

   CAPI: The install failed. The rsabase.dll file that is being installed
   doesn't match the signature file or the value in the registry.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a version mismatch in the Rsabase.dll and Rsasig.dll files.
This version mismatch can occur by installing Internet Explorer 5, re-applying
SP4, and then installing the NTOP.

RESOLUTION
==========

The correct file versions for the service pack can be obtained from the
Microsoft DLL Help database at the following location:

   http://support.microsoft.com/servicedesks/fileversion/dllinfo.asp

When you have the correct file versions, rename the incorrect file, copy the
correct version from the service pack media, disable (uncheck) the "Read Only"
attribute (if applicable), and then re-apply the service pack.
