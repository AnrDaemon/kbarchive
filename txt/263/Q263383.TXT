PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Systems Management Server (SMS) client computer that is running Microsoft
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, programs that are advertised
with the "Assign immediately after this event" option set to Logon do not run by
design. However, programs that are advertised with the "Assign immediately after
this event" option set to Logoff do run.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not advertise programs with the "Assign immediately after this event" option
set to Logoff on Terminal Servers. Instead, assign an actual time to run or set
the advertisement to run with the "As soon as possible" option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
