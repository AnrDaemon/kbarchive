TITLE   :XADM: Gear Icon for Mailboxes on a DL After Import from CSV
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you import members to a distribution list from a .csv file, the members'
names may show up with a gear symbol next to them instead of a mailbox or world
symbol.

This indicates that there is no directory entry for that object or the directory
object is not correctly specified.

CAUSE
=====

The members of the distribution list are not specified correctly in the .csv
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the Members column of the .csv file has the correct information and
format pointing to the member mailbox.

For example, the distribution list that you are adding to or modifying may reside
in ContainerA but the member mailbox that you are adding to the distribution
list may reside in ContainerB. In this case, you need to use the following
format in the Members column of the .csv file:

ContainerB/cn=<alias>

If you were to use

ContainerA/cn=<alias>
the result would be the user showing up in ContainerA with a gear icon and the
distribution list would not work.

If you do not specify the correct container where the recipient resides, Exchange
Server does not recognize the directory object as a valid object.
