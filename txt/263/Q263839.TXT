SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Transfer control implements two widely used Internet protocols: the
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). You can
use the Internet Transfer control to connect to any site that uses one of these
protocols, and you can use the Execute method to retrieve files.

You can also use the GET command with the Execute method to copy files from a FTP
site to a local hard disk drive. However, the command does not natively support
a destination folder that has long file names and spaces within the path. The
command executes but does not send the GET command to the FTP server. This
article describes how you can save a file that has a long file name and spaces
within the path from an FTP site to a local folder.

To save a file from the FTP site to a local folder, use the following code:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Inet1.UserName = "Username"
       Inet1.Password = "Password"
       Inet1.URL = "ftp://YourFTPServer"
       Inet1.Execute , "GET testfile.txt " & Chr(34) & "C:\Program Files\LongFileName.txt" & Chr(34)
   End Sub
