TITLE   :Software Inventory Enumerates, Inventories NTFS Reparsed Volumes
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 2000 and is a Systems
Management Server client has an NTFS file system volume mounted to a folder, the
Software Inventory client agent inventories the contents of the folder as a
folder, and then again as a volume.

As a result of this, the Software Inventory process takes a considerably long
time to complete, particularly on servers where multiple mount points are
defined. This results in unnecessary time, processor utilization, and disk
input/output (I/O), and may cause performance issues on servers.

CAUSE
=====

The Software Inventory client agent cannot distinguish between a normal folder
and a folder that reparses (input broken down again into small chunks) to a
volume. If a volume is mounted multiple times, each instance is duplicate work
for the inventory agent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
