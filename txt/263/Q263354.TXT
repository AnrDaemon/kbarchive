TITLE   :NT Logon Server Manager Error Message When Deinstalling Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbConfig kbMMC kbServer kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsmsAdmin kbStatSum kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

At the end of a domain update cycle, the NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER thread of the
SMS Executive service attempts to write the Mastercfg.mcf file on the primary
domain controller. If you removed the domain by using Windows Networking Logon
Client Installation or Windows Networking Logon Discovery, error code 67 is
returned. This means that the path was not found because the logon point no
longer exists. This results in an error message (message ID 1405) being
generated.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can safely ignore this error message. This message occurs only once after
the first domain update cycle after you remove a domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
