TITLE   :XADM: Time Settings Incorrect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program on a computer other
than the Exchange Server computer, the time zone of the computer on which the
Administrator program is run is used to adjust any time settings that may be
made.

This results in the Administrator setting schedules that may not be what is
expected.

CAUSE
=====

This situation is normally seen when the Exchange Server administration is
centralized in one location and there are Exchange Server computers in different
time zones around the world. The Administrator program runs on a computer in one
time zone and then changes are made to the schedules of Exchange Server
computers in different time zones.

For example, an Administrator program on a computer in the Central time zone
connects to a server in Japan with the Japanese time zone setting. The
administrator changes the information store maintenance schedule to be between
12 midnight and 2 A.M. Because the computer on which the Administrator program
run is in the Central time zone, the information store maintenance schedule that
actually gets set on the Japanese server is 2 P.M. to 4 P.M., which is not what
the administrator intended. The reason for this is that all time settings are
converted into Universal Time (GMT) using the local computer's time zone
setting, and then saved in the Exchange Server computer's database. When you
view the settings, the local time zone is used to convert the Universal time
into local time.

WORKAROUND
==========

Some possible workarounds to this issue are to run the Administrator program
remotely on the Exchange Server computer itself or to change the time zone
setting on the computer that is running the Administrator program to match that
of the Exchange Server computer.
