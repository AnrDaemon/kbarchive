======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete many status messages in Status Message Viewer, not all of the
messages may have had time to be selected, and some messages may remain
undeleted. If you then select the rest and delete them, you may receive the
following error message when you click Show All Messages:

   Statview.exe Application Error

   The instruction at "0x77f7d5cc" referenced memory at "0x00000001". The memory
   could not be "written".
   Click on OK to terminate the application

Clicking OK closes the Status Viewer window, which you can open again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you specify to delete the status messages before the
Select All command has had time to finish.

WORKAROUND
==========

After you click Select All, allow enough time for all of the status messages to
be selected before you delete them. During the Select All process, the pointer
is displayed as an hourglass.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
