Mailbox Manager is a tool to implement corporate e-mail retention policies.
Features of Mailbox Manager include the following:

 - Configuration flexibility. You can configure Mailbox Manager to delete
   messages according to message age, folder size, message type, and other
   parameters.

 - Automation. You can create a weekly schedule that specifies when Mailbox
   Manager deletes messages from Exchange Server mailboxes.

 - Report generation. You can configure Mailbox Manager to log detailed reports
   about message removal and other Mailbox Manager activities and to send the
   reports to administrators.

This article lists the versions of Exchange Server and Microsoft Windows NT
Server that must be installed for Mailbox Manager to work properly.
