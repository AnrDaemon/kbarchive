TITLE   :SMS: Unable to View Advertisements in SMS Administrator Console
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbSecurity kbsms200 kbsmsAdmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Systems Management Server Administrator (SMS) console, you are
not able to view or edit advertisements even though you have been given Create,
Delete, Modify, and Read rights to the Advertisement class.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because your rights to the Advertisement class are not
sufficient. To fully access advertisements by using the SMS Administrator
console, you must have at least Read rights to the following object classes or
individual instances:

 - Packages

 - Collections

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior also applies to instances of objects. However, if you are given an
instance level right for Package A, but the only advertisement that is listed is
for Package B, Package B is not displayed. You must have instance level rights
to the package that the corresponding advertised program belongs to.
