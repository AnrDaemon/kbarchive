======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run various Microsoft Systems Management Server services in both
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and Microsoft Windows 2000, you may find that the
services are unable to establish communication with a site system and the site
system is flagged to be reinstalled.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

 - A server is unavailable during the Systems Management Server services normal
   polling cycle, because of scheduled downtime or transient network failure.

 - The security policy is modified to prevent domain administrators from making
   policy changes.

 - The security policy is configured to deny "logon as a service" rights to all
   domain accounts. When Systems Management Server services are configured to
   use one of these accounts and the Systems Management Server Administrator
   configures either logon discovery/installation or configures a domain
   controller as a client access point (CAP), the logon server manager or site
   component manager configures itself on the new site system. The security
   policy prevents "logon as a service" rights and a new account is created to
   support the new service. The new account works until the security policy is
   applied to the system at the next logon or refresh interval. The new account
   does not have "logon as a service" rights and the service cannot start again.
   When the failed service is detected, the site system is marked for
   reinstallation. This cycle continues until the security policy is corrected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, try one of the following:

 - Grant the Systems Management Server Service account the rights to add this
   policy to accounts.

 - Change the default policy to allow any account to log on as a service on
   domain controllers.

 - Do not use Logon Discovery. Use logon installation or Network Discovery -
   Remote Client Installation to install clients.

 - Do not use domain controllers as CAPs.
