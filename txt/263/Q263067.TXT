SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a Microsoft Office 97 document (for example, a Microsoft Word
document) to a contact in a public folder contact list, the attachment may be
garbled when the recipient receives it. However, if you manually address the
e-mail or select a private contact as the recipient, the e-mail message is sent
with the correct content type (application/msword).
