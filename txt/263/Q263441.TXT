======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft Windows 2000-based server is an existing Microsoft Systems
Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client, and then Windows 2000 Terminal Services is
enabled, the Software Distribution components reconfigure themselves
automatically. SMS Client Component Installation Manager (CCIM) detects that the
client state has changed, and triggers all components to run a verification
cycle, where components are reinstalled if required.

The Advertised Programs and Advertised Programs Monitor tools are not removed
from Control Panel as expected, as a part of the component reinstallation.

CAUSE
=====

Software Distribution on Windows 2000-based servers running Terminal Services is
not intended to interact with the logged on user. The results of enabling
Terminal Services on an existing SMS 2.0 client may cause unpredictable Software
Distribution behavior.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, remove and reinstall SMS 2.0 Client components
from the Terminal Services enabled server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The client verification cycle performed by Available Programs Manager and
Software Distribution does not remove the user mode tools from Control Panel.
The Advertised Programs Manager cannot schedule any advertisements to run in the
context of the currently logged on user because of the component verification.
