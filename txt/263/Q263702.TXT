To upgrade the connectors to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 SP3, go to the SP3

   <Language>\Exchconn\Setup\<Platform>\Setup\Gwconn

 - Connector for SNADS:

 - Connector for OfficeVision/VM:
   <Language>\Exchconn\Setup\<Platform>\Setup\Ovvconn

where <Language> is the installed language for the server (for example, Eng
is English), and where <Platform> is the processor platform (for example,
I386 for Intel processors).
Double-click the executable in the directory.

For more information, see the Readme.rtf file that is located in the
Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn folder of the SP3 compact disc after you install the
connectors.
