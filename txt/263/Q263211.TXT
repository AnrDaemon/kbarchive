SYMPTOMS
========

If SNA Server has an active LU6.2 (APPC) session to an IBM AS/400 system over a
switched line (for example Token Ring or Ethernet), and the connection or SNA
Server service is stopped, the APPC controller on the AS/400 may change to an
RCYPND (Recovery Pending) state. When you restart SNA Server or the connection,
the connection remains in a Pending state until the AS/400 APPC controller is
manually varied off and on again by an AS/400 administrator.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact IBM to obtain the latest cumulative PTF for the appropriate OS/400
version. To order the latest cumulative PTF from IBM, use the following IBM
order numbers:

 - OS/400 V4R1 - SF99410

 - OS/400 V4R2 - SF99420

 - OS/400 V4R3 - SF99430

 - OS/400 V4R4 - SF99440

Specific PTF information for the appropriate OS/400 release is as follows:

 - OS/400 V3R1 - There is no PTF fix for this release. V3R1 is not Y2K compliant
   and IBM no longer supports this release.

 - OS/400 V3R2 - The latest cumulative PTF is 98139, but it does not contain the
   fix. You need to order the fix separately. The fix is included in the V3R2
   Y2K Group PTF SF99201. You can also get the individual PTF for V3R2 through
   SF56344.

 - OS/400 V4R3 - The latest cumulative fix is 9077 and includes this fix. The
   V4R3 Y2K Group PTF SF99200 (same number for V3R7 - V4R4) also includes the
   fix. The individual PTF for this fix is SF53861.

 - OS/400 V4R4 - The V4R4 Y2K Group PTF 9049 includes this fix. The individual
   PTF for this fix is SF58794.
