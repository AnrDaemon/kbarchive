TITLE   :DB5_setSingleValuedAttribute() Returns "Invalid Encoding (0)"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbtool metadirectory MMS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following warning message may appear in the Genlogs file:

   WRN_00 01a2 00/03/15 16:54:10.686 (DB5_setSingleValuedAttribute) Invalid
   encoding (0) specified for attribute <XXXXXXX>, dn (null).

CAUSE
=====

At some point in the past, the database contained an error (probably a syntactic
error) in the schema definitions as defined in either the Db5attr.oid or
Custom.oid file. An indeterminate number of records that contain these specific,
malformed attributes were written into the directory. Subsequently, the server
that is running Microsoft Metadirectory Services (in builds after build 261)
caught these errors when the records were being rewritten, and performed the
lookupFromOID process to determine the correct attribute encoding.

RESOLUTION
==========

The warning message means that schema definition errors are being corrected as
records are being rewritten. As a precaution, run the Chkoids.exe program to
verify that the directory-based object identification (OID) definitions are
correct.


MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) 2.2, OID definitions are inspected and
verified as they are accepted into the directory; incomplete or illegal
definitions are immediately rejected. This enhanced checking should prevent
"Invalid encoding" messages from appearing in MMS 2.2.
