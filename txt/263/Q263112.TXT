======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 message transfer agent (MTA) is
installed on a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, the MTA
may log an event 1016 when it is writing an extensible counter to the Windows
2000 Server Performance Monitor log.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Performance Monitor in Windows 2000 Server requires
that performance data be entered in 8-byte lengths. The MTA does not always use
8-byte lengths.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.
