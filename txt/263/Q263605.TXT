TITLE   :HalAssignSlotResources() Call May Not Assign Resources
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400PreSP7Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On i840 symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) computers with multiple PCI buses and AGP
ports, a HalAssignSlotResources call may not assign resources for a Universal
Host Controller Interface (UHCI) USB host controller.

CAUSE
=====

The call does not work because the MPS hardware abstraction layer (HAL) does not
search for PCI interrupt routings beyond #INTA.
