SYMPTOMS

Information Services (IIS) 5.0, which is included in Microsoft Windows 2000
Server, is not available in Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional.

use of a virtual Web site, which is not supported in Windows 2000 Professional.

NOTE: The MMC-based Internet Services Manager can be used to remotely administer
IIS over an intranet. However, if you must remotely administer IIS over the
Internet or through a proxy server, which requires the use of the browser-based
Internet Services Manager (HTML), you need to run IIS 5.0 on Windows 2000
Server.
