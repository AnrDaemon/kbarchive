TITLE   :XADM: Error When You Import a Folder with MBX Proxy Addresses
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to import a .csv file into an Exchange Server folder with proxy
addresses for mailboxes with an .mbx file name extension, you receive the
following error message

   The directory import from file <Filename>.CSV is complete.
   <X> Error descriptions were recorded in the system's application event
   log.
   The file <path>csv.err contains copies of all object descriptions
   containing errors.

Also, the following event is logged in the Application event log.

   Event ID : 238
   Source : MSExchangeDSImp
   Category : none
   Type : Error
   Description :

   The e-mail address specified for import object <Useralias> is not
   unique. MBX:1 has already been assigned to Address Book entry
   /o=<Organisation></ou=Site></cn=container></cn=<useralias>>

CAUSE
=====

The import procedure does not work because you cannot use the same proxy
address, of any type, for more than one recipient. In this case, the value of
MBX:1 or MBX:0 is assigned to the first record in the .csv file and cannot be
assigned to any subsequent entries in the .csv file.

STATUS
======

The folder import procedure cannot be adopted to include or exclude mailboxes
from cleaning. You can achieve this only by using the Mailbox Manager tool.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the Mailbox Manager tool, you can either include or set a policy
for each container to exclude a mailbox. Corresponding to the selection, the
tool generates a proxy address for the corresponding mailbox of either type
MBX:0 or type MBX:1. However, if you try to import a .csv file, it does not work
and you receive the error message that is mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
