TITLE   :XWEB: OWA Hangs During Log On If One Server Is Unavailable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If multiple Exchange Server computers service Outlook Web Access (OWA) and one
of those servers becomes inaccessible, OWA stops responding (or "hangs") for the
users that are trying to log on to the inaccessible server and also the users
that are trying to log on to the other servers until the attempt to log on to
the inaccessible server times out.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

OWA also stops responding when the Microsoft Windows NT domain is synchronized.
During this replication process no OWA users are authenticated, which causes OWA
to stop responding.
