TITLE   :XADM: Event ID 1016 and 1002 Occurs When Directory Service Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the directory service, you may receive the following error
message

   Window NT "Internal Error 2140"

in which case, the application log records the following events:

   Event ID: 1016
   Source: MsExchangeDS
   Description: Missing configuration parameter (DSA Database file). The
   Microsoft Exchange Server database (EDB) may be corrupted. Try to reinstall
   the software.

   Event ID: 1002
   Source: MsExchangeDS
   Description: The Microsoft Exchange Server database (EDB) could not be
   initialized and returned error 1. Unrecoverable error, the directory can not
   continue.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a registry key is missing or has been deleted from
the following registry setting:

   HKeyLocalMachine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters

By default, the service account should have full access to the following keys:

   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters]

   "Database log files path"="[path name]"
   "Database logging/recovery"="ON"
   "DSA Temporary file"="[path name]"
   "EDB max log buffers"=dword:00000040
   "EDB log buffer flush threshold"=dword:00000020
   "EDB log flush period"=dword:000001f4
   "DSA Hierarchy table file"="[path name]"
   "Hierarchy Table Recalculation interval (minutes)"=dword:000002d0
   "DSA Working Directory"="[path name]"
   "Max Threads (EXDS+NSP+DRA)"=dword:00000030
   "Replicator deleted object conflict lifetime (days)"=dword:00000001
   "Replicator notify pause after modify (secs)"=dword:0000012c
   "Replicator notify pause between DSAs (secs)"=dword:0000001e
   "Replicator inter site packet size"=dword:00000200
   "Replicator intra site packet size"=dword:00000064
   "Circular Logging"=dword:00000001
   "Dsa Database File"="[path name]"

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, verify that the service account has full access to all of
the registry keys listed in the "Cause" section. If one of these keys is missing
or has been deleted, you must re-create it.
