TITLE   :SMS: Repackager Stops Responding During Visio 2000 Compilation
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbtool kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbPackage kbsmsInst kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to repackage Visio 2000 by using the Systems Management Server
(SMS) installer utility, the repackage function may stop responding (hang) or
generate a Dr. Watson error message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because Visio 2000 does not support a silent installation
by using the SMS installer. For Visio 2000, setup technologies shifted from
InstallShield to the Microsoft Installer (MSI). Unanticipated complications in
integrating the new MSI technology precluded the inclusion of the silent
installation feature in Visio 2000.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, corporate deployment of Visio 2000 provides three
alternatives to silent installation for large organizations:

 - Publish by using Windows 2000 Active Directory.

 - Use a Windows Terminal Server installation.

 - Use a network installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
