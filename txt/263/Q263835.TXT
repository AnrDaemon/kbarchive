TITLE   :XCON: MTA Stops (Event ID 9411), Free Disk Space More Than 10 MB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) service stops responding and
reports Event ID 9411 in the application event log:

   Event 9411
   The MTA is terminating because the disk where MTADATA is located has less than
   10 MB of space, or an error occurred while trying to check for free space on
   the disk. If disk space is low, free up some disk space and restart the MTA.

When you check the amount of free hard disk space, it far exceeds the 10
megabytes (MB) of space that the MTA requires to function properly.

CAUSE
=====

The page file, Mtadata, is located on a disk that has little remaining free
space but the amount of free disk space is being reported as more than 10 MB.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the page file to a drive with a larger quantity of free space.
