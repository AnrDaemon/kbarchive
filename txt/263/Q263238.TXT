TITLE   :XFOR: Lotus Notes Connector May Not Work If ID File Has Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following list are symptoms that you might see if you have assigned a
password to the ID file for the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes:

 - There is no mail flow over the Exchange Notes Connector, and the sender
   generates a non-delivery report (NDR).

 - Directory Synchronization is not successful.

 - When you view the status of the Exchange Notes Connector processes, which is
   in the Process Manager of the Microsoft Connectivity Administrator, Convert
   Exchange to Notes (LME-NOTES-MEXNTS) and Convert Notes to Exchange
   (LME-NOTES-NTSMEX) show a "clock" symbol instead of a green icon, which
   indicates a status of "started."

The Current Activity field for these processes states that they are logging into
the Notes Mail queue.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Notes Connector has no place in which to specify a password for the
Notes ID file that is associated with the connector.

RESOLUTION
==========

Removing the password from the Notes ID should resolve the problem. To remove
the password, you can use either of these methods:

 - Create a new ID file, and then set the appropriate permissions.

 - Re-certify the Notes ID with a blank password. For more information, see the
   documentation accompanying the Notes server software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server, you can specify a password for the Connector
ID, and so it is not required to have a Connector ID without a password.
