TITLE   :SMS: Can't Upgrade Client to SP2 w/ SMSMan from Logon Point
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the SMSMan utility to manually upgrade a Systems
Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client to SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), you may
receive the following error message:

   Unable to complete the installation process.

CAUSE
=====

Running the SMSMan utility from a Logon Point does not upgrade a client
workstation to the latest service pack. This failure is by design, because the
Logon Point may have a different version of code than the Client Access Point
(CAP). This protects workstations in the enterprise from using mixed versions of
Service Pack 1 and Service Pack 2.

Because client upgrade should only be initiated during the Client Configuration
and Installation Manager (CCIM) maintenance cycle, the message received on the
workstation may be misleading.

RESOLUTION
==========

Allow the workstations to be upgraded through the normal CCIM maintenance cycle.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
