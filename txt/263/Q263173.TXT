TITLE   :XADM: Only 100 Accounts Extracted from Active Directory Domain
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 on a Microsoft Windows 2000
Advanced Server-based computer that is a domain controller, and then on the
Tools menu in the Exchange Server Administrator program, click Extract Windows
NT Account List to extract the Windows 2000 domain accounts to a .csv file, the
process may not work and only the first 100 accounts are extracted to the .csv
file.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Administrator program calls Windows application
programming interface (API) "NetQueryDisplayInformation" to extract the
Microsoft Windows NT accounts, but the returned value of the function in Windows
2000 is different from the returned value of the function in Windows NT 4.0. If
Exchange Server is running on a Windows 2000-based computer, Exchange Server
incorrectly processes the returned value when the Windows NT accounts number
more than 100.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.
