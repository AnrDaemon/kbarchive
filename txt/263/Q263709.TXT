TITLE   :XCON: Message Smaller Than Size Restriction Returned w/ NDR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A message that is smaller than the size restriction on a remote Message Transfer
Agent (MTA) is rejected with a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) stating that the
content length is too long.

CAUSE
=====

If the MTA in the originating site passes the message to a mailbox server where
the size restriction configured on the local MTA is smaller than the message
size, the MTA rejects the message instead of passing it to the connector server
to be delivered to the foreign mail system.

RESOLUTION
==========

Clear the selection of the Mailbox servers from the Target Servers tab of the
Site Connector, or make MTA size restrictions uniform throughout all sites.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example:

A message from the originating site, Site A, enters Site B by way of a Site
Connector. In Site A, the Target Servers tab on the Site Connector properties
has all remote servers in Site B selected. The mailbox servers in Site B have a
smaller size restriction set on their MTAs than the connector servers in Site B.
