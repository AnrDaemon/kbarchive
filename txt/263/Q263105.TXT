The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional

SYMPTOMS
========

When an environment varibale is defined from a batch file or from the
command-line, the defined variable and value do not appear in other command-line
windows (Ntvdm.exe instances) and/or are not available to programs.

CAUSE
=====

The set command defines a variable only for the current command line session,
(Ntvdm.exe).

When you double-click a batch file, the batch file runs in its own NTVDM session
and then closes, so the environment variable does not show up when you open a
new session or look in another session to see the values.

RESOLUTION
==========

The solution is to use setx from the Windows NT resource kit, because it can
establish environment variables for a user session or define a system variable.

Setx has three modes of operation: it can define a variable for the user's
session, or the system overall, or it can extract a value from the registry and
set the result to the user session or the system. See the examples below:

To set a system variable:
setx color blue -m

To set a user variable:
setx color green

To extract a registry value and set a variable to a system variable:
setx color -k HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console\ScreenColors -m
(To set a registry key value to a user session variable simply omit the -m
switch)

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
