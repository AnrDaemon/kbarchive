======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Exchange Server Performance Optimizer finishes, it attempts to restart
every Exchange Server service that was running when Performance Optimizer
started. If Exchange Server key Management server (KM server) is installed,
Performance Optimizer cannot start the KM server service. If you allow
Performance Optimizer to continue to try to start the service, Performance
Optimizer eventually stops responding and the following error message is
displayed:

   The service could not be started. It did not respond in a timely manner. -
   [800FF351]

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message in the "Summary" section of this article is displayed because
the correct startup parameters are not used when the service is started. The
startup parameter string is provided during the setup of KM server and is
referred to as the "KMS password used to encrypt the database."

To prevent Performance Optimizer from stopping at the KM server service, either
make sure that you stop the KM server service before you start Performance
Optimizer, or make sure that you click the "Do not restart these services"
option in the last dialog box of Performance Optimizer.

If Performance Optimizer stops responding when it tries to start the KM server
service, you can quit the process by using Task Manager:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL, and then click Task Manager.

2. In Task Manager, click the Applications tab, click Microsoft Exchange
   Performance Optimizer, and then click End Task.

3. A dialog box is displayed that provides the options to Wait, End Task, or
   Cancel. Click End Task.

After you perform these steps, you can manually start your Exchange Server
services.
