-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Driver Development Kit (DDK), on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Intermittent system halts (crashes) may occur when an network driver interface
specification (NDIS) Wide Area Networking (WAN) driver calls the
NdisMWanIndicateReceive function.

CAUSE
=====

NdisMWanIndicateReceive attempts to read the first byte past the end of the
packet buffer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Allocate a buffer for the packet that is at least 4 bytes larger than the actual
packet size. However, the PacketSize argument in the NdisMWanIndicateReceive
call should be set to the actual size of the packet buffer. For example, if the
packet buffer needs to be 100 bytes in size, then allocate at least 104 bytes
for the buffer (but the PacketSize argument should be equal to 100 bytes).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
