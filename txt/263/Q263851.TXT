SUMMARY
=======

When you view the Send Queue Size counter for the MSExchangeIS Private object in
Microsoft Windows NT Performance Monitor, the Send Queue Size counter may
contain a value that is consistently greater than 0. The Send Queue Size counter
is the number of messages that have been configured with the Deferred Delivery
or Submission property.

This article describes how to use diagnostic logging in Exchange Server to
generate events that relate to the size of the Send queue and the scheduled
delivery time of each message in the Send queue.

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Exchange Server
   object, and then click Properties on the File menu.

2. Click the Diagnostics Logging tab, and then click to expand MSExchangeIS in
   the Services pane.

3. In the Services pane, click Private, and then change Transport Sending to a
   logging level of Maximum.

After you enable the preceding settings, the following event messages will be
logged in the application event log:
