-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add a new central site to an existing large site hierarchy, Offer
Summarizer tries to replicate all offer status data to the parent site on all
primary sites that are directly beneath the new site. This process may take a
long time to complete.

This is a normal process where eventually, the Offer Status Summarizer is able to
produce a .sum file and all of the status messages are replicated to the new
parent site. However, the Systems Management Server (SMS) Executive service may
stop due to a low memory condition during this process, and this is more likely
to occur when the amount of rows in the Offer Status tables is very large, for
example, one million status messages.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
