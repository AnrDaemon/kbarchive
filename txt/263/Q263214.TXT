======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 Service Pack 2 site
server is installed on a server running Windows 2000 Server, a number of error
messages may be recorded for the SMS_Executive component of the site server at
shutdown.

When this occurs, status message 579 is recorded for the SMS_Executive component
when you view the system status for your site code:

   Could not write registry key
   "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components
   \SMS_EXECUTIVE\Threads\SMS_STATUS_MANAGER" on computer "site server". The
   operating system reported error 1723: The RPC server is too busy to complete
   this operation.

After the server restarts, the status summarizer displays warning messages and
the SMS_Executive component has a critical status. If logging is enabled for
SMS_Executive, the errors are also recorded in the Smsexe.log file.


WORKAROUND
==========

To can work around this behavior and stop these error messages, stop the
SMS_Executive service before you shut down the server running Windows 2000
Server.

You can use the following commands to stop SMS_Executive:

   "NET STOP SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER
   NET STOP SMS_EXECUTIVE"

You can automate this workaround if you use a shutdown script on the server
running Windows 2000 Server that functions as a SMS 2.0 site server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
