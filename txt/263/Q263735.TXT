SYMPTOMS
========

In Internet Explorer, an error message similar to the following may occur:

   The rating label on this page is invalid. "2001.05.22T12:00--200" is not
   recognized or is not the right format. You may want to notify the owner of
   this site.

This error message only occurs if the time zone in the Regional Settings on the
server has been set to east of GMT when you set the content rating.

this case, the metabase contains the following time/date string:

The correct string is as follows:

   2001.05.22T12:00+0200

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved in Windows 2000. Install Windows 2000.

WORKAROUND
==========

you set the content rating on the server.
