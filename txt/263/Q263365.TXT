TITLE   :SMS: Remote Control Not Removed if Terminal Services Is Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Systems Management Server client is installed on a Microsoft
Windows 2000 Server computer on which the Terminal Services program is not
available, Remote Tools are automatically installed and function normally. If
Terminal Services is subsequently made available, Remote Tools are not
automatically removed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the Remote Tools Client Agent is not installed if
Terminal Services is enabled in Application mode on the Terminal Services
Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To remove Remote Tools from Terminal Services on the Windows 2000 Server
computer, remove the Systems Management Server client, and then re-install the
client while Terminal Services is running. The Systems Management Server client
then recognizes that Terminal Services is running on the Windows 2000 Server
computer and does not install Remote Tools.

NOTE: Remote Tools are not supported on computers running Terminal Services
Server and SMS 2.0 with SP 2 or earlier. This has been resolved in the latest
Service Pack (SP3).


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
