TITLE   :BUG: Nested Class Does Not See typedef in the Enclosing Class
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC600bug kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

According to the ANSI C++ Standard, a nested class should find a symbol in its
enclosing class's scope before it finds it in global scope. However, when the
code is compiled with Microsoft C++ compiler, the global scope is searched ahead
of the enclosing class's scope.

Please refer to the sample code in the "More Information" section for details.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following sample code demonstrates the bug:

   // Test.cpp
   // Compiler option needed: /GX

   #include <iostream>
   using std::cout;
   using std::endl;

   struct Target
   {
     static void test()
     {
       cout <<
         "BUG: Nested class doesn't see typedef in the enclosing class."
       << endl;
     }
   };

   struct CorrectTarget
   {
     static void test()
     {
       cout <<
         "Good: Nested  class CORRECTLY finds 'Target' as typedef in the enclosing class."
       << endl;
     }
   };

   struct Tester
   {
     typedef CorrectTarget Target;

     struct Inner
     {
       static void test()
       {
         Target::test();
       }
     };
   };

   void main()
   {
     Tester::Inner::test();
   }

Program output: BUG: Nested class doesn't see typedef in the enclosing class.
