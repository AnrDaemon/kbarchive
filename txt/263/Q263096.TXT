======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an APPC application calls the ACTIVATE_SESSION function to start a
dependent LU6.2 session, the deactivation_event handle may not be signaled when
the session ends. Specifically, if the APPC application starts two dependent
LU6.2 sessions using the ACTIVATE_SESSION function, the wrong deactivation_event
handle may be signaled when an UNBIND is received on one of the sessions. This
problem does not occur with independent LU6.2.

NOTE: The ACTIVATE_SESSION API feature was added in Microsoft SNA Server 4.0
Service Pack 2. For additional information, click the article number below to

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a bug in the ACTIVATE_SESSION function in the
Winmgt32.dll file. When the client Winmgt32.dll receives the UNBIND notification
from SNA Server, it searches its control blocks for a match on the session ID to
determine which event to signal. Unfortunately, with dependent LUs the session
ID is always zero (the same for both sessions). Therefore, the wrong event
handle (associated with a different session) can be signaled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 SP2 and
SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.
