The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer system's backup domain controller cannot be promoted to a primary
domain controller through the server manager and the domain is unavailable to
manage. Your computer system's event log contains the following error messages:

   Event ID 3096 The Windows NT domain controller for this domain could not be
   located.

   Event ID 5516 The computer or domain <computername> trusts domain
   <domainname>. This may be an indirect trust. However,
   <computername> and <domainname> have the same security
   identifier. NT should be reinstalled on <domainname> or
   <computername>.

CAUSE
=====

A trust relationship is configured from the backup domain controller to the
domain to which the backup domain controller is a member.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, you must delete the trust relationship between the
backup domain controller and the domain by performing the following steps:

1. Start User Manager for Domains.

2. Click Policies, and then click Trust Relationships.

3. Remove Trust Relationships for the domain.

4. Start Server Manager.

   The domain should be available.

5. Select the backup domain controller to be promoted.

6. Click Computer, and then click "Promote to Primary Domain Controller".
