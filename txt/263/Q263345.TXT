TITLE   :SMS: Client Installation Is Prevented if Logon Point Has Changed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, you may not be able
to install clients.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the logon point that the SMS 2.0 clients are
installing from has changed. The Copylog.tcf file on the logon point incorrectly
directs clients to an SMS site that no longer uses the same logon point.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, perform one of the following methods:

 - Upgrade your existing SMS site(s) in the domain to a newer version of SMS
   2.0. If a site that presently uses the logon point upgrades to Service Pack 2
   (SP2) for SMS 2.0, the Copylog.tcf file is updated with the correct site
   information.

 - Remove the domain from Logon Discovery and Logon Installation for all sites
   presently using the logon point, and then add the domain again, so that the
   Copylog.tcf file is updated correctly. You may have to remove any remaining
   SMS files in the SMSLogon point before re-enabling the logon points.

 - Enable the original site that created the logon points to use them again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each SMSLogon share has a file, Copylog.tcf, that lists each file on the logon
point and the site responsible for copying it. The client restart (bootstrap)
code uses this information to determine which site copied the Core Client
Installation file (Clicore.exe) to the logon point, and uses that site's
configuration information in the core client installation process.

For example, if site AAA is configured to install logon points in a domain, and
the Copylog.tcf file shows that site AAA copied the Clicore.exe file to the
client, then site BBB (the same SMS version as site AAA) is configured to
install logon points in the same domain. This creates shared logon points. Site
BBB does not need to do any file copying aside from copying its site-specific
files, so the Copylog.tcf file shows site AAA for most files.

If site AAA's administrator decides site AAA cannot participate in that logon
point domain, then site AAA removes the domain from Logon Discovery and Logon
Installation. The Sites\AAA directory is removed from the logon point. However,
the Copylog.tcf file still shows site AAA as the site that supplied the
Clicore.exe file. Subsequent site BBB domain updates cannot change that, because
site BBB does not have reason to copy over the existing core client components,
unless site BBB is upgraded.

When a new client logs on to that domain, the restart (bootstrap) code looks to
see what site supplied the Clicore.exe file from the Copylog.tcf file, and
discovers site AAA. It tries to look for Sites\AAA\Cli_inst.cfg to obtain the
configuration information. But since site AAA is no longer using the logon
point, that directory and file no longer exist. Therefore, the client restart
(bootstrap) cannot continue.

NOTE: The above example deals with sites from the same SMS version. However, if
the sites are not the same version, other issues can occur.
