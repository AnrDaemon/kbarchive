Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following sample programs demonstrate the bug:

   //test1.cpp
   // compiler option needed: none
   class X {
   private:
     static int s_i;
     enum {e};
     static void f() {}
   };
   int X::s_i = 0;

   int main() 
   {
     int i  = ::X::s_i; //no error here
     i = ::X::e;        //no error here
     ::X::f();          //no error here
     
     return 0;
   }

   //test2.cpp
   // compiler option needed: none
   namespace N 
   {
     class X 
     {
     private:
       static int s_i;
       enum {e};
       static void f() {}
     };
   }
   int N::X::s_i = 0;

   int main() 
   {
     int i  = N::X::s_i; //no error here
     i = N::X::e;        //no error here
     N::X::f();          //no error here

     return 0;
