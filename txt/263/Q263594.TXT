SYMPTOMS
========

If a client is disconnected from a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 site for
long periods of time (the time varies according to inventory schedule), Copy
Queue Manager on the client begins adding registry entries until the registry is
filled to its capacity. This causes the loss of the user's profile as noted in
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q189119 UserEnv Returns Corrupted Profile for All Failures Including RSL
   Exceeded

CAUSE
=====

If the destination is inaccessible, Copy Queue Manager does not delete the
expired items in the keys under the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client Components\SMS Client
   Base Components\Copy Queue\Destination <XXXX>

The registry keeps growing if new entries are continuously added for inaccessible
destinations.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Reconnect the client to the SMS site if it is still available. You can also
manually delete the expired items from the client's registry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
