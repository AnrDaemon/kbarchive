======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running SNA Server that has the Data Link Control (DLC) bound to
teamed IBM Netfinity 10/100 Ethernet adapters to communicate with the host may
experience dropped LU-LU sessions. The following events may appear in the
Application event log.

   Event Source: SNA Server
   Event ID: 4
   Description:
   (1133) Message Sequence Error

   Event Source: SNA Server
   Event ID: 13
   Description:
   (1141) Message Sequence Error (SENSE = 0)

   Event Source: SNA Server
   Event ID: 38
   Description:
   APPC session deactivated abnormally

CAUSE
=====

A packet arrives at the SNA Server link service that is corrupt, causing a
sequence number to be skipped. Because the next packet that arrives has a
sequence number that is not one greater than the previous, SNA Server sends an
UNBIND to the host with sense code 2001, which means there is a sequence error.

RESOLUTION
==========

The teaming function for the adapters that are bound to the DLC must be
configured for Fault Tolerance mode, rather than Fast Ether Channel.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable teaming for the DLC, and use a single NIC for the SNA Server-to-host
link.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An SNA Server trace of this problem contains the following messages (data is
truncated for simplicity). The sequence numbers, noted by ^^^^ in each RU, are
009B, 009C, and 009E:

A network trace captured on an independent computer displayed a good RU with
sequence 009D arriving at the Ethernet switch to which SNA Server was
connected.
