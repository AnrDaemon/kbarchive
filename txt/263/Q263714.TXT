TITLE   :XCON: MTA Doesn't Reroute Mail Queued for Internet Mail Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0,5.5

KEYWORDS:exc4 exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail is queued waiting to be delivered
by the Internet Mail Service, and the Internet Mail Service becomes inactive,
the message transfer agent (MTA) does not reroute the SMTP mail to a different
server to make use of another Internet Mail Service.

CAUSE
=====

Although the MTA reroutes mail, the MTA only reroutes mail for X.400 application
programming interface (XAPI) connections, which include X.400, Site Connector,
and remote procedure call (RPC) communications within a site. When e-mail
messages are queued for an Exchange Development Kit (EDK) gateway, such as the
Internet Mail Service, the MTA has already completed the routing algorithm
process and queued the messages for outbound delivery. For the Internet Mail
Service, this is the "Internet Mail Service local_machine_name" queue.

When mail is in the "Internet Mail Service local_machine_name" queue, the mail
waits to be placed in the Mts-out folder of the Internet Mail Service in the
information store. The mail is not removed from this queue until the mail is
placed in the information store Mts-out folder.

Rerouting occurs when mail is transferred between MTAs by using the previously
mentioned XAPI connectors. If the remote MTA is not available, the messages are
rerouted to an alternate route through these connectors.
