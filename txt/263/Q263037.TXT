This article describes how to manually remove and reinstall DirectPlay version
6.x or later on Windows 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manually remove and reinstall DirectPlay, use the following methods in the
order in which they are presented.

Step 1: Download the Latest Version of Microsoft DirectX
--------------------------------------------------------

To download the latest version of DirectX:

1. Visit the following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp

2. Find, and then click the latest version of the DirectX executable file.

3. In the File Download dialog box, click "Save this program to disk", and then
   click OK.

4. In the "Save in" box, click Desktop, and then click Save.

Step 2: Remove DirectPlay
-------------------------

NOTE: If you remove DirectPlay, your operating system may become unstable if you
do not reinstall it or you reinstall an earlier version.

To remove DirectPlay:

1. Restart Your Computer in Safe Mode. To do this in Windows 98, restart your
   computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after your computer completes the
   Power On Self Test (POST), and then select Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

2. Rename the DirectX Files.

   The following files are located in the Windows\System folder:

    - Dplay.dll

    - Dplaymodemx.dll

    - Dplaysvr.exe

    - Dplaywsock.dll

    - Dplaywsockx.dll

    - Dplayx.dll

    - Dpserial.dll

   To rename the DirectX files:

   a. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

   b. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you
      type each line:

   cd system
   ren dplaywsock.dll dplaywsock.old
   ren dplaywsockx.dll dplaywsockx.old
   ren dplaymodemx.dll dplaymodemx.old
   ren dplayx.dll dplayx.old
   ren dplaysvr.exe dplaysvr.old
   ren dplay.dll dplay.old
   ren dpserial.dll dpserial.old
   exit

Step 3: Delete the DirectX Registry Keys
----------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To delete the DirectX registry keys:

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Locate, and then click the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DirectPlay

3. On the Edit menu, click Delete, and then when you receive a prompt to
   confirm, click Yes.

4. Locate, and then click the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DirectX

5. On the Edit menu, click Delete, and then when you receive a prompt to
   confirm, click Yes.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

Step 4: Reinstall DirectX in Safe Mode
--------------------------------------

1. Exit to Safe Mode by following steps in Step 2.

2. Once you are you in Safe Mode, double-click the executable that you have
   downloaded in Step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to install or reinstall DirectX.

4. When you receive a prompt to restart your computer, do so.
