The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a counter in the Add Counters dialog box in the Performance
Monitor utility (PerfMon.exe), the Add button may be disabled. Consequently, the
corresponding performance counter cannot be monitored through Performance
Monitor.

CAUSE
=====

The Add button is disabled if the Performance Extension DLL for the selected
performance object reports that there are currently 0 instances of the object.
This behavior is also seen if the Performance Extension DLL reports that there
are 0 instances for a performance object that doesn't even support instance
data.

RESOLUTION
==========

The PERF_OBJECT_TYPE structure describes object-specific performance information
that is returned by a Performance Extension DLL. This structure contains a
member called NumInstances that specifies the number of object instances for
which counters are provided.

If the performance object will never provide instance data by means of
PERF_INSTANCE_DEFINITION structures, the NumInstances value should be set to
PERF_NO_INSTANCES, or -1. If the performance object supports 0 or more
instances, the NumInstances value should reflect the current number of instances
of the object.
