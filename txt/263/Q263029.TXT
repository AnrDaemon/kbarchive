TITLE   :XCON: Internet Mail Service Setup Does Not Work on Windows 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to install the Exchange Server 5.5 Internet Mail Service on a
computer that is running Windows 2000 Server that is a cluster server, the Setup
Wizard may stop responding when it attempts to start services and the following
error message may be displayed:

   Overlapped I/O operation is in progress.

   ID no: 0xc00203e5

The following event is also logged in the application event log:

   EventID 4058

   Category: Intialization/Termination


CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the cluster server does not have the Domain Name System
(DNS) portion of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
stack set up correctly and does not have A records for the cluster servers in
the local DNS. The DNS is on Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, which does
not support automatic registration of DNS entries.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, determine the host (A) records that should be listed for
the Exchange Cluster.

1. From the Cluster Administrator, open the Exchange Group.

2. Record the IP address and the network name of the Exchange service.

3. Record the IP address and the network Name of the Cluster server.

NOTE: The Exchange network name and IP, and the Cluster network name and IP
should be different.

On the Cluster server itself, set up the DNS tab in the TCP/IP stack properties
to search the local DNS before searching the Internet service provider's DNS:

1. Right-click My Network Places, and then click Properties.

2. Right-click Local Area Connection, and then click Properties.

3. Click Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), click Properties, and then click Advanced.

4. Click the DNS tab.

5. Under "DNS server addresses, in order of use", arrange the list so that the
   DNS server on the local network is used before the DNS server on the
   Internet.

6. Within the Local Network DNS, add Host (A) records for:

    - Exchange Name and IP Address

    - Cluster Name and IP Address
