SUMMARY
=======

An extension conflict is one of the most common issues that appear with programs
on the Macintosh. However, the range of behaviors that may occur with an
extension conflict is varied. Behaviors can be as simple as menu commands
appearing as unavailable, or as complex as a crash or freeze with an error
message.

Testing for an extension conflict is one of the easiest tests available. To test
for an extension conflict, follow these steps:

1. Quit all programs.

2. On the Special menu, click Restart and then press SHIFT.

3. Continue holding SHIFT until a message appears stating that the extensions
   have been disabled or turned off.

   NOTE: This process temporarily turns off add-on components (extensions and
   control panels) of the operating system that can conflict with one another or
   other programs. To turn the extensions back on, restart the computer
   normally.

4. Start the program, and perform the same steps that resulted in the original
   problem.

If the problem continues to occur, the cause is probably not an extension
conflict. You must continue troubleshooting the operating system.

If the problem no longer occurs with extensions turned off, an extension or
control panel is interfering with either the operating system or with Office.
You must locate the file that is causing this behavior. To do that, use the
process of elimination.

An excellent tool for this process is the Extension Manager control panel, which
lists most of the extensions and control panels that are installed in the
operating system. To start the process of elimination, follow these steps:

1. On the Apple menu, click Control Panels, and then click Extension Manager.

2. In the Extension Manager, make sure that you save the current set of
   extensions that are running and then switch to the Base Set.

   NOTE: The Base Set is located either at the top of the dialog box with a
   drop-down menu or on the File menu.

3. Scroll through the list, and turn on all the extensions that start with the
   word "Microsoft". Restart the computer.

4. Test the program for the previous behavior.

If the behavior continues, you know that it is with one of the extensions or
control panels that is turned on. You must start eliminating files from the list
of those currently turned on in the Extension Manager.

If the behavior does not occur with the Base Set + Microsoft extensions turned
on, you know that the file that is causing the behavior is not part of that set.
You must add extensions to that set (note which extensions or control panels you
add), restart the computer, and test for the behavior until it occurs again.
After that, you must test the extensions or control panels that were recently
added to find one that is causing the behavior.

After you locate the file that is causing the behavior, contact the manufacturer
of the software to see whether an updated version is available.

However, if the behavior does not occur when the computer is started with
extensions temporarily turned off, but you do not locate the file after you
troubleshoot extensions with the Extension Manager, please contact Apple
Technical Support for further assistance.
