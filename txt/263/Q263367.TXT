======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Component Status Summarizer, you can specify the thresholds for yellow
Warning or red Critical icons in the Component Status display for each message
type.

You can set these properties in the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator
console by double-clicking the following items to open them:

   Site Database\Site Hierarchy\<sitecode>\Site Settings\Status
   Summarizers\Component Status Summarizer\Thresholds tab

Setting the Warning or Critical threshold to 0 (zero) for any component does not
disable the threshold as described in the online Help that is associated with
the dialog box. It has the same effect as setting the threshold to 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
