TITLE   :SMS: Refreshing Multiple Network Trace Maps Causes Icon Overlap
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you open multiple windows in the Network Trace tool and then refresh the
windows that opened first, icons that represent the site may overlap. Each icon
may be placed on top of the other, making the trace map unreadable. When you try
to refresh the affected network trace windows, the problem is not corrected. You
can refresh the window that is opened last with no adverse effects.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the icon overlap problem, close the affected windows, and then
restart the Network Trace tool for the site system by using a single window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
