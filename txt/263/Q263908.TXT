PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 kbExchange550preSP4fix kbExchange550sp4Fix kbgraphxlinkcritical kbExchange2000SP1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Store.exe process stops responding (crashes), perhaps on more than one
server in the organization. If Dr. Watson is enabled, and Exchange symbols are
installed, the stack of the crashing thread is similar to the following:

   

   FramePtr ReturnAd Param#1  Param#2  Param#3  Param#4  Function Name
   0277fd9c 00535952 0277fe30 0277fdec 073f1ae0 0000003f store!EcReplFolderMessagesUnpack [omap]  (FPO: [EBP 0x00000000] [2,35,4])

In addition, the following events may be logged:

   Event 3089 Warning

   Error 0x80004002 occurred while processing an incoming replication message.

-and-

   Event 3079 Error

   Unexpected replication thread error 0x80004002.
   EcReplFolderMessagesUnpack
   EcReplMessageUnpack
   FReplRcvAgent

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a public folder replication message that has been
changed by an anti-virus program, adding an attachment which reports that a
virus has been removed. The resulting message is in an invalid format, causing
the store to crash.
