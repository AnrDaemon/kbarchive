======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Systems Management Server (SMS) administrator from an SMS site (for
example, AAA) attempts to create a client access point (CAP) or secondary site
on a computer that is already a site that has the SMS Executive service
installed, but this computer belongs to a different SMS site (for example, BBB),
the Site Component Manager from site AAA is unsuccessful. The Site Component
Manager, however, does not remove the entry from the control file of site AAA
and continues to attempt to install the CAP on site BBB.

Errors may be logged in the Sitecomp.log file on every processing cycle. The
Sitecomp.log file may have a "The computer <xxx> is already a site system
in site BBB" entry and the log file creates an error status for that component.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because a CAP has a thread of the SMS Executive service
called the SMS Inbox Manager Assistant. The SMS Executive service may only be
controlled by a single SMS site and only a single instance of the SMS Executive
service may be present on a computer.

The Site Component Manager component of the SMS site can install the SMS
Executive service on a computer that has been selected to be a CAP, unless an
existing instance of the SMS Executive service already exists from another site.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not enumerate any servers (that already exist as
a site in another SMS site) as a CAP or secondary site in a SMS version 2.0
site. To recover from an unsuccessful attempt to install a CAP or secondary site
on a server which is a site in another SMS site, remove the computer from the
server which has been incorrectly selected from the list of sites (for example,
site BBB).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
