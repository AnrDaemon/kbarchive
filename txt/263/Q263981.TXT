SUMMARY
=======

Windows 2000 Device Driver Kit (DDK) documentation incorrectly states the
following:

 - A protocol driver can send a OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN to a miniport to
   specify one or more wake-up patterns.

 - A protocol driver can a send a OID_PNP_REMOVE_WAKE_UP_PATTERN to a miniport
   to delete one or more wake-up patterns.

In fact, a protocol driver can specify only one wake-up pattern to a miniport
driver by sending the object identifier (OID) OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN.
Similarly, a protocol driver can delete only one wake-up pattern by sending
OID_PNP_REMOVE_WAKE_UP_PATTERN to a miniport driver.
