TITLE   :XCLN: Password Dialog Box for Domain Credentials Hangs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbOffice2000sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook 2000 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you initiate a remote mail connection in Outlook 2000 by using the Remote
Mail feature, the dialog box for logon information (domain credentials) may stop
responding (or "hang") until you start another program.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the password dialog thread runs within the main
spooler thread, which does not allow the password dialog thread to be the item
that is in focus. When the password dialog thread is moved to a background
thread, it allows the focus to shift to the new item in focus without
interfering with the main Outlook process.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Office
2000. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q276367 OFF2000: How to Obtain the Latest Office 2000 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 2000. This
problem was first corrected in Microsoft Office 2000 Service Pack 2.
