TITLE   :SMS: Software Distribution 'Stop Program' Does Not Work Properly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0 SP1,2.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Software Distribution Stop Program option may not stop the program
completely. The program stops but the Windows NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM)
process and its subprocesses are left running. In Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), this behavior does not occur for all 32-bit
programs.

In Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0, the program
seems to quit, but Advertised Programs Manager (APM) still reports the program
as running.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Stop Program option in SMS, you cannot stop a 16-bit program
that has exceeded its allotted time by 15 minutes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, manually stop the Ntvdm.exe process.
