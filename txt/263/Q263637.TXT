KEYWORDS:kbCompiler kbCPPonly kbVC500 kbVC500bug kbVC600 kbVC600bug kbDSupport kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The compiler incorrectly uses private or protected constructors when temporary
class objects are created.

NOTE: The compiler generates a C4248 warning if compiled with the /W3 or /W4
compiler switch.

Please refer to the sample code in the "More Information" section for details.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following sample code demonstrates the bug:

   // Test.cpp
   // Compiler option needed: /GX
   class A
   {
   protected:
       A(int i) : m_i(i) {}
   private:
       int m_i;
   };

   int main()
   {
    //A a(8); // Error C2248 here, as expected.
    A(8);	// No error here. 
           // Produces warning C4248 with compiler switch /W3 or /W4.    

       try
       {
           throw A(8); // No error here also. 
                  // Produces warning C4248 with compiler switch /W3 or /W4.
       }
       catch (A& a)
       {
       }

       return 0;
   }
