SYMPTOMS
========

On computers running Windows 2000 Server, if IIS is installed, the Internet
Services Manager (ISM) is added to the Windows "Administrative Tools" menu.
However, on computers running Windows 2000 Professional, this menu item is not
created.

NOTE: The ISM starts the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) with the Internet
Information Services snap-in loaded. The snap-in file that the ISM opens is
located in %SystemRoot%\System32\Inetsrv\Iis.msc.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following resolutions to start the IIS snap-in:

Resolution 1:

In the Windows Control Panel, open Administrative Tools, and then open Internet
Services Manager.

Resolution 2:

1. On the Windows desktop, right-click My Computer, and then click Manage.

2. Open Services and Applications.

3. Open Internet Information Services.

Resolution 3:

Create a shortcut to %SystemRoot%\System32\Inetsrv\Iis.msc.

Resolution 4:

1. Click the Start menu, and then click Run.

2. Type "Mmc.exe" (without the quotation marks) and then click OK.

3. In the MMC, click the Console menu, then click "Add/Remove Snap-in".

4. Click Add, and then select the Internet Information Services snap-in.

5. Click Add, click Close, and then click OK to return to the main MMC window.

6. From the Console menu, click Save, and then click Save (using the default
   file extension of .msc).

7. The next time you need to use the Internet Information Services snap-in, open
   the .msc file you just saved.

NOTE: You can add additional snap-ins to this .msc file for your convenience.
