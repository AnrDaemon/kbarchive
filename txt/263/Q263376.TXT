======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Distribution Manager deletes the entire source in a shared folder when you use
the "Share distribution folder" option if you specify the same folder name as
the source folder and the share distribution folder.

For example, the following scenario demonstrates this issue:

 - Folder XYZ_DP exists and is shared as XYZ_DP. This folder contains original
   source files for program ProgramXYZ.

 - You create a package named XYZPackage and you select the "This package
   contains source files" option on the Data Source tab.

 - You specify a network path of \\<Servername>\XYZ_DP in the "Source
   directory" dialog box.

 - On the Data Access tab, you specify a share name of XYZ_DB in the "Share
   distribution folder" box.

After you define these properties and the distribution points are updated for
this package, the original source files for program ProgramXYZ are deleted. The
XYZ_DP share on each distribution point is then created and contains no source
files.

CAUSE
=====

Distribution Manager detects that share XYZ_DP exists, and then deletes and
re-creates this share. No status messages are generated and no messages are
placed in the Distmgr.log file about the deletion of an existing share.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not specify the original source folder as the share distribution folder. Use
separate folders.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
