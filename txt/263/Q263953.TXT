KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) and try to create a new
management agent, the following error message may be displayed:

   DS Action Modification request returns 32 Modify error 18032 Error setting
   metaverse location

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the MMS server did not initialize during the
installation process.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use either of the following methods:

 - Reinstall MMS from the CD-ROM.

 - Re-initialize your existing MMS database by running the following command at
   a command prompt:

   zoomserv\bin\init\init.bat

WARNING: Running the Zoomserv\Bin\Init\Init.bat file from a command prompt
re-initializes your database and erases all the contents of the MMS directory
store.
