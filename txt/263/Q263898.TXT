SYMPTOMS
========

Users on a client computer that has regional settings set to one of the Eastern
European values (such as Hungarian, or Croatian) may see either missing
characters, or the wrong characters, where they are expecting characters from
the extended character set.

CAUSE
=====

The message has arrived over an X.400 Connector from a system that has sent the
message in a T.61 (Teletex) body part. The message transfer agent (MTA)
conversion code translates characters only from Code Page 850 (Western European)
in this body part, so characters from Code Page 852 (Eastern European) are not
translated correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
