TITLE   :Domain Admins Group Is Not Added to Local Administrators Group
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install network components on a computer that is running Windows NT 4.0
and join a domain at the same time, the domain Administrators group is not added
to the local Administrators group on that workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Do not join the domain immediately after you add the network components. Add
   the network components, restart the computer, and then use the Networks tool
   in Control Panel to join the computer to the domain.

 - After you join the computer to the domain, log on to the local machine
   account as an administrator and add the domain Administrators group to the
   local Administrators group.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
