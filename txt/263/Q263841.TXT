TITLE   :PC DB: NDR When Sending from Microsoft Mail to Exchange Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:; winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 
 - Microsoft Mail for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft Mail (MS Mail) user tries to send e-mail to an Exchange Server
user by using Microsoft Outlook, the MS Mail user may receive a non-delivery
report (NDR) that states that the Exchange Server user does not exist. If the
same MS Mail user tries to send e-mail to an Exchange Server user by using the
MS Mail client, the message is delivered successfully.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if there is corruption in the address list for the Exchange
Server shadow postoffice (.usr file).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Use the MS Mail Administrator program to delete the reference to the shadow
   postoffice. This causes the old .usr file to be abandoned.

2. Request a full import by using the MS Mail Administrator program.

3. Wait for directory synchronization to finish or perform a manual directory
   synchronization. This process creates and populates the new .usr file.
