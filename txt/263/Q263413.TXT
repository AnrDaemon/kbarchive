PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg kbsetup kbsms200bug kbsms200preSP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Remote Control on a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
client on a Microsoft Windows 98/95-based computer, you may receive the
following error message:

   Cannot find the file \PCDDOS.EXE. Make sure that the file exists on your
   system and that the path and filename are correct.

While this message is displayed, the computer stops responding except for the
ability to dismiss the dialog box. After you close the dialog box, the client
installation continues normally. In some cases, a reboot may be required to
finish this installation.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur during the installation when the Remote Control component
looks for PCDDOS in the %windir% folder instead of the %sms_local_dir% folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the environment variable for sms_local_dir
to c:\windows.

STATUS
======
