TITLE   :XADM: Exchange replication fails with 1102 s and 1103 s between
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5 SP3
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If the Exchange Server computer that performs directory replication in your system does not have an anti-virus application
programming interface (API) mode virus scanner installed, this article does not apply.

SYMPTOMS
========

Replication between sites may stop working sporadically and the following event
IDs may be logged on the directory replication bridgehead servers:

   Source: MSexchangeDS
   MessageId=1102
   Severity=Warning
   During intersite replication, the directory replication agent (DRA) closed the
   connection to the mail service in response to error %1. Will attempt to
   connect again later.

   Source: MSexchangeDS
   MessageId=1103
   Severity=Warning
   During intersite replication, the directory replication agent (DRA) received a
   non-delivery report (NDR) for messages submitted for the directory at %1. The
   diagnostic is %2. The reason is %3.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 makes
virus-scanning APIs available to speed up attachment scanning.


Because of this, certain replication problems can occur if the replication
messages contain attachments. For additional information, click the article

   Are Enabled

==========

programming interface (API) scanner and apply the information store fix, build
5.5.2652.42, that is described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

   Q262491 XADM: Information Store Crashes When Using Antivirus Application
   Programming Interface
