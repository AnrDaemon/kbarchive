======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Systems Management Server (SMS) client software inventory agent runs on
a Windows 2000-based computer with significant amounts of remote storage (such
as a tape autoloader), it cycles through all of the offline storage tapes, and
restores all of the files back onto the computer's hard disk for inventory.

This causes the remote storage system to continuously move files to and from
remote storage, trying to adhere to storage limits on each volume while
providing files to inventory.

Because of this, inventory may never finish and the tape system and disk
sub-systems may be very busy.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because when software inventory opens files to read
header information, Windows 2000 recalls the remote copy from remote storage
(such as tape media) to the local hard disk before opening the file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, on the client that has remote storage configured,
disable software inventory on each drive by creating a hidden file named
Skpswi.dat and place it in the root folder of the drive. Software inventory does
not run again on these drives until the Skipswi.dat file is removed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
