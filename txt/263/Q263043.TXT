SUMMARY
=======

MSN 5.x is designed to be turned on or turned off. When you turn MSN off, the
software removes everything but the desktop icon and the setup and installation
files. Because of this, if you want to use MSN again, all you need to do is
double-click the desktop icon. The setup screen will display and you will not
need the CD to reinstall. MSN 5.x is intentionally easy to turn off and turn on.
If a you have a problem with a corrupted file, turning off and then turning on
the software may fix the problem.

However, if you want to remove the desktop icon altogether, you can remove it by
editing the registry files. You must be disconnected from MSN for this procedure
to work.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To remove the MSN 5.x icon from your Windows desktop

1. Click Start and click Run.

2. Type regedit and click OK.

3. In the left window open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder, open the Software
   folder, and then open the Microsoft folder.

4. Open the Windows folder, open the CurrentVersion folder, and then open the
   Explorer folder.

5. Open the Desktop folder and then open the Namespace folder.

6. In the left-hand pane select and delete the following key name
   88667D10-10F0-11D0-8150-00AA00BF8457.

Note: Neither removing the desktop icon, nor turning off MSN on your computer,
cancels your MSN account. To cancel your account go to
http://memberservices.msn.com/us/uscancel.htm.

If you wish to re-install MSN you can use the CD or download the software. It
will prompt you to re-install.
