======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a custom Microsoft Windows NT share for a package distribution
point you cannot make permission modifications for the access account.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only on previously distributed packages on distribution
points that are custom-created Windows NT shares. New packages receive the
correct permissions, but they cannot be modified once they are distributed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, you can change permissions if you remove the
package from the distribution point, adjust the access accounts, and then
redistribute the package to the distribution point.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
