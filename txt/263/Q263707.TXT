SUMMARY
=======

When you use a GPS device that utilizes a program to virtually map the
information to the communications port it is not detected by the programs listed
at the beginning of this article and you may receive the following error
message:

   A communications (COM) port is available, but no signal is being received.
   Make sure the GPS receiver is turned on and connected to the correct port.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Such devices include PDA or Handheld GPS adapters, and Serial-to-Universal
Serial Bus (USB) port adapter. This behavior can occur if the GPS device uses a
program that emulates the communications (COM) port or creates a virtual COM
port.
