======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Logon Server Manager does not reset senior site information when processing
multiple domains.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the in-memory cache object is recycled for each
domain by its primary domain controller (PDC), and it is not able to configure
the senior site on the backup domain controllers (BDCs).

The Logon Server Manager designates a senior site to update BDCs in cases where
more than one site shares a logon point. The general logic for senior site
election gives preference to site version, then to site code ASCII values on the
sites. The Senior.lst file can be placed on the PDC of a domain to designate a
specific senior site that can override that logic. However, when sites span
multiple domains, the Senior.lst file cannot transmit the senior site
information to the BDCs. The file is not able to configure a senior site for
other domains.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the Logon Service Manager is servicing more than one domain, the Senior.lst
file must be added to all the domains. This can be done by adding the file to
the PDC on each of the domains.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
