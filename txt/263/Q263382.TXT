======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a Systems Management Server (SMS) site from SMS 1.2 to SMS 2.0,
you may see two instances of each drive when you click Logical Disks in Resource
Explorer after you run hardware inventory on the client that you upgraded. This
is true for hard disks, floppy disk drives, and CD-ROM drives.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS 1.2 disk data is not removed by SMS 2.0 during the upgrade of the client
hardware inventory data.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run the following query against the SMS 2.0 site database to remove the SMS 1.2
logical disk data.

NOTE: Back up your SMS site database before you run this query.

   

   delete ld1
   from logical_disk_data ld1
   join logical_disk_data ld2 
  on ld1.MachineID=ld2.MachineID
   and substring(ld1.DeviceID0,1,1)=substring(ld2.DeviceID0,1,1)
   where ld1.TimeKey < ld2.TimeKey

You can run this query in either ISQL_w (for Microsoft SQL Server 6.5) or SQL
Query Analyzer (for SQL Server 7.0).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can cause inaccurate reporting when you query clients for free
space. The SMS 1.2 disk data is never updated and reflects the free space at the
time that you upgrade to SMS 2.0.
