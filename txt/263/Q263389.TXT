   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft Windows NT 3.51-based computer is used by multiple users,
multiple profiles are defined on that computer. If you upgrade the computer from
Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 SP4 to SMS 2.0 SP2, some SMS 1.2 client
items might remain in the user profiles. For example, a profile might retain the
SMS 1.2 SP4 Client program group, or a "Cannot find file Smsrun32.exe" error
message might appear during logon. These problems occur only on computers that
are running Windows NT 3.51.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To remove the SMS Client program group, start Program Manager and delete the
Client program group.

To prevent the "Cannot find file Smsrun32.exe" error message, use Registry Editor
(Regedt32.exe) to open the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive. In the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Load key,
delete the Smsrun32.exe value. You must repeat this method for each user.
