TITLE   :XCON: Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise Incorrectly Transl
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise, you may
experience problems converting Nordic characters. For example, if you send a
message that contains Nordic characters from Microsoft Outlook 2000 through an
Exchange Server 5.5 computer to a GroupWise recipient, when by the GroupWise
client receives the message, the characters are not translated properly. This
problem also occurs if a message that contains Nordic characters is sent from a
GroupWise client to an Outlook 2000 recipient through an Exchange Server 5.5
computer.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur for the following reasons, all of which need to addressed
for messages to be received correctly both on Exchange Server and GroupWise:

 - The GroupWise postoffice needs to have the code page 850 translation tables
   installed for the application programming interface (API) gateway. For
   further information, contact Novell Technical Support.

 - The following parameter needs to be added to the [LME-GWISE] section in the
   Exchconn.ini file in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn folder:

   GWCodePage=850

   This parameter forces the gateway to use code page 850 for character
   translation to and from Exchange Server. You must restart the Exchange
   Connector for Novell GroupWise for this change to take effect.

 - The default locale on the Exchange Server computer needs to be changed to a
   Nordic code page, for example, Norwegian or Swedish.


If you correctly implement the preceding three changes, you can solve most
character translation problems. However, you may still experience problems with
the combined character "AE" or "ae" (produced by ALT+0198 for the uppercase
character or ALT+0230 for the lowercase character). These single characters may
be translated to two characters, "AE" and "ae", respectively. To resolve this
problem, apply the fix in the "Resolution" section of this article. This fix
needs to be applied in conjunction with the preceding three changes.
