OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, versions 2.0, 7.0 
 - Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a run-time application that you created with the
Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) or the Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools (ODE), you may receive one of the following error messages.

   

   Installing ADT 2.0 Run-Time Application on Windows 95:

   Usage: [/A]
   Use /A to run setup in administrator mode.

   

   Installing ADT 7.0 or ODE Run-Time Application on Windows 95:

   Setup Error 530
   This is an invalid command line option: <partial path>

   When you click OK, a message box containing usage information for setup
   appears.

   

   Installing Run-Time Application (Any Version) on Windows NT 4.0:

   Cannot find the file <path to setup.exe> (or one of its components).
   Check to ensure the path and filename are correct and that all the required
   libraries are available.

Setup then fails.

CAUSE
=====

There is a space in the path of the file, Setup.exe. For example, you receive
one of the errors described in the "Symptoms" section if Setup.exe is located on
the following network share:

   \\MyComputer\My Path\Setup.exe

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the name of the network share on which your run-time application Setup
program is located to one that does not contain spaces in the path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Access Developer's
Toolkit and Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools.
