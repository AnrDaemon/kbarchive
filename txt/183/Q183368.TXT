SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the requirements to view (or browse) other computers on
the network from a Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium
Edition (Me) client using a Dial-Up Networking connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are three methods by which a Windows client logging onto a network with a
Dial-Up Networking connection can browse other computers on the network.

Method 1
--------

Before making a Dial-Up Networking connection to the network, select NetBEUI or
IPX/SPX as the default network protocol. These protocols act as a gateway,
allowing the Windows 95 client to browse other computers on the network.

Method 2
--------

If you want to use TCP/IP as your network protocol, enable the WIN Server (WINS)
service on the Dial-Up Networking server to which the Windows 95 clients
connects. Disable WINS if it is installed on the Windows 95 client. To disable
WINS, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Network icon.

3. On the Configuration tab, click TCP/IP, and then click Properties.

4. On the WINS Configuration tab, click Disable WINS Resolution.

5. Click OK, and then click OK.

Method 3
--------

With WINS disabled, you need special LMHOSTS entries that designate all the
domain controllers. To do this, use the following convention

   199.199.199.1  <MyDomainController>   #PRE  #DOM:<DomainName>

where <MyDomainController> is the name of the primary domain controller for
a domain whose resources you want to browse, and 199.199.199.1 is the IP address
of the primary domain controller.

For additional information about LMHOSTS files, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
