An SNA Server computer using SNARAS may experience an application exception in
Rasman.exe in function SnaRasUnbind() after successfully opening and closing a
number of SNARAS connections in succession.

Windows NT directory when the application exception occurs:

In one reported instance of this problem, the application exception occurred
after 20 to 30 SNA Server SNARAS connections were opened and then closed in

CAUSE
=====

The application exception is caused when SNARAS attempts to access memory that
has been released.
