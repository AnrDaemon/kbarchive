TITLE   :XADM: Event Agent Fires Every 15 min If No Schedule Is Defined
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, on platform(s):
    - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing an Event Agent to a folder in Exchange 5.5, the user can select
the "A scheduled event occurs" event handler. If the user does not click
Schedule and define a specific schedule, the Event will fire on a 15 minute
interval, however, the expected behavior is that this event would not fire at
all.

When the user checks the Scheduled Event properties page, the Schedule is set to
Hourly, with the Run Event set for Every 0 hour and 0 min.

WORKAROUND
==========

Explicitly click Schedule and define a specific schedule.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.5 for Alpha.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
