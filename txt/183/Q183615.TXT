======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

Store.exe suddenly stops with an access violation. If Dr. Watson is active as
the default debugger, then a Dr. Watson log and a User.dmp (if configured to
create a User.dmp) may be produced.


CAUSE
=====

The messaging client is improperly formatting a message. This can occur for
messages containing HTML with overlapping FONT tags with multiple font names.
The actual crash is caused by freeing an invalid pointer.
