DOCUMENT:Q183237  10-AUG-2001  [winnt]
TITLE   :Windows NT 4.0 Fails to Start on a Uniprocessor Compaq
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfaq

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a post-Service Pack 3 (SP3) hotfix Ntoskrnl.exe dated 11/20/97
or later, the system fails to restart. The system will stop responding (hang) at
the Blue screen listing the Windows NT version and service pack information. The
personal computer is a uni-processor Compaq running Compaq's System Manager
driver, Sysmgmt.sys.


CAUSE
=====

Newer Ntoskrnl.exe code has been redesigned because of the Pentium errata bug.
This new behavior conflicts with Compaq's Sysmgmt.sys driver, causing the driver
to fail to load, which stops the system from starting.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename Sysmgmt.sys or get the latest driver from Compaq which resolves this
problem.

Sysmgmt.sys is manufactured by Compaq Corp., a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
