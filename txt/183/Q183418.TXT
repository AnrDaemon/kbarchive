TITLE   :BUG: Build Succeeds Despite Invalid Custom Build Command
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.0sp1,5.0sp2,5.0sp3,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbVC600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 5.0sp1, 5.0sp2, 5.0sp3, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, versions 5.0, 5.0sp2, 5.0sp2, 5.0sp3, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The message "Bad command or file name" shows up in the Build pane. On Windows
NT, the build fails with an error. However, on Windows 95 the project may still
build with no errors indicated.

CAUSE
=====

A custom build step references a non-existent executable. The command
interpreters for Windows 95 and Windows NT, which spawn the custom build
command, respond differently for non-existent executables.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following are two possible resolutions:

 - Make the custom build command refer to a valid file.

 - Create an application that spawns other executables, and have it return an
   error code on failure to load.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
