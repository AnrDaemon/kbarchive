======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

With the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), you can also administer earlier
versions of Internet Information Server (IIS). For example, if you have five Web
servers running IIS 3.0 and you initially upgrade one of them to IIS 4.0, you
can administer all of them from the MMC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a temporary folder.

2. From the Windows NT 4.0 CD, copy the following files into the temporary
   folder you have created:

   Fscfg.dll, W3scfg.dll, and Gscfg.dll from \I386\inetsrv\ directory
   Fscfg.hlp, W3scfg.hlp, and Gscfg.hlp from \I386\inetsrv\help\ directory

3. Rename the files in the temporary folder. For example:

     Old Name     New Name 
     ========     ========
     Fscfg.dll    Fscfg3.dll
     W3scfg.dll   W3scfg3.dll
     Gscfg.dll    Gscfg3.dll
     Fscfg.hlp    Fscfg3.hlp
     W3scfg.hlp   W3scfg3.hlp
     Gscfg.hlp    Gscfg3.hlp

NOTE: The Gopher DLL (Gscfg.dll) does not have to be renamed, but this has been
done for consistency.
4. Copy the renamed files into your C:\WINNT\system32\inetsrv directory.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems, including
the failure of a Web site or FTP site, that may require you to reinstall your
operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own
risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
5. Add the following registry values (with data type REG_SZ) to
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\InetMgr\Parameters\AddOnServices:

   WWW3 =
   C:\WINNT\System32\inetsrv\w3scfg3.dll::SUPCFG:C:\WINNT\system32\inetsrv
   \w3scfg.dll

   FTP3 =
   C:\WINNT\System32\inetsrv\fscfg3.dll::SUPCFG:C:\WINNT\system32\inetsrv
   \fscfg.dll

   GOPHER3 = C:\WINNT\System32\inetsrv\gscfg3.dll

6. Connect to a server running IIS 3.0 from the MMC. To do this, follow these
   steps:

   a. Open the MMC.

   b. Select Internet Information Server.

   c. Click Action, and then click Connect.

   d. Enter the name of the Web server to which you want to connect.

At this point, the Web server can be viewed from the MMC.

The Properties toolbar button in the MMC is not available for down-level sites.
Instead, you must right-click on the name of the site and select Properties. You
can also select Properties on the Action menu.

You can also administer IIS 3.0 from the MMC of the Personal Web Server installed
on Windows NT 4.0 Workstation. The DLLs must still be copied from the Windows NT
4.0 Server compact disc and renamed. This work around is officially unsupported.
