TITLE   :SMS: Windows 95 Page File Is Not Inventoried
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbInventory smsinv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When looking in the Systems Management Server Administrator program at the
Personal Computer Properties for a Windows 95 Client, PC Memory reports the
following page file information:

   Page File Name:           Not Available
   Page File Size (MBytes):  0

CAUSE
=====

The inventory agent (Invdos.exe) looks for the page file using the following key
in the System.ini file when performing a hardware inventory:

   [386enh]
   PagingFile=C:\xxx\WIN386.SWP

Because Windows 95 does not use this convention to maintain its paging file, the
paging file is not found and therefore not inventoried.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in System Management Server version
1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
