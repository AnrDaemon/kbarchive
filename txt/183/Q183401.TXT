TITLE   :Poor Print Quality from Adobe Acrobat on 600 DPI Printer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Certain graphics printed from Adobe Acrobat appear light when printed to a 600
dpi laser printer. When the same graphic is printed on a 300 dpi printer, the
printout is darker.

CAUSE
=====

The application is drawing 1 pixel wide lines so, at 600 dpi, diagonal lines
appear very light because laser printers cannot hold a single isolated dot on
the drum. This is also because of the application not specifying a logical pen
width.

RESOLUTION
==========

To print the graphic correctly, you can use one of the following workarounds:

 - Change the resolution to 300 dpi.

 - Print your graphic using a PostScript printer driver.

 - Change the line width in the application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
