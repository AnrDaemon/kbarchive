Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MapiSend.exe is a Resource Kit utility that allows a user to send a message to
an Exchange user from a DOS command window. If you are not logged on to an
Exchange Client and are logged into a different domain from the Windows prompt,
you will not be able to use the correct authentication necessary to use the
MapiSend utility. For more information concerning the MapiSend.exe utility, see
the Readme.txt file in the Exchange or BackOffice Resource Kit.
