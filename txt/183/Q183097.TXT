TITLE   :Event Log May Not Grow to Configured Size
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although you have increased the "Maximum Log Size" in Event Viewer from the
default of 512 KB to a very high value, the corresponding event log file does
not grow beyond a certain size.

CAUSE
=====

With Event Viewer, you can specify a maximum log size of 4 GB separately for
every log (System, Security, and Application). In the current design of the
event log facility, however, the log file does not grow over approximately 300
MB depending on the memory situation. If the log is configured to "Do not
overwrite events," new events will not be written.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid setting the event log this high. Depending on the amount of events, back
up and clear the event log on a regular basis, and configure the log to
"Overwrite Events as Needed."

To back up the log, you can use Windows NT Backup, or DUMPEL from the Windows NT
Resource Kit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
