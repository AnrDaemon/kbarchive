PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5

KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Outlook Web Access client to try to send a message that may or
may not contain an attachment, the following error message may appear:

   Failed to Send This Item

CAUSE
=====

You have exceeded the Prohibit Send limit set in the Exchange Administrator
program for your mailbox or the information store. This error may also occur if
the outgoing message is larger than the prescribed limit set by the
Administrator for outgoing messages.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reduce the number of messages in your server- based
mailbox to a level below the limit set that will prohibit sending new messages.
You can do this either by deleting some of the messages in your mailbox or by
creating a personal folder file (PST) in an Exchange profile and downloading
some of the messages to your local computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the above listed versions.
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
