SUMMARY
=======

A dialog box may appear that contains the following error message:

   Popup error: lsmexout.exe - Unable to Locate DLL The dynamic link
   library RPCDCE4.dll could not be found in the specified path.

This may occur under any of these conditions:

 - When the Exchange Notes Connector (LinkAge Message Exchange version 3.2)
   starts, the dialog box may appear.

   -or-

 - The Queue Viewer may not load and the connector can generate the dialog box
   that contains the error message.

   -or-

 - After the LinkAge Connector property pages are loaded, the Exchange
   Administrator program may cause a dialog box with the same error Message to
   appear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LinkAge now packages the Rpcdce4.dll file into the LinkAge Message Exchange
version 3.2 product. It is installed in the Linkage directory. Microsoft Windows
NT 3.51 systems have this DLL file in the Winnt\System32 directory, but Windows
NT 4.0 systems do not.

To resolve the problem, obtain this DLL file from the Linkage\Redist directory or
from a Windows NT 3.51 computer and copy it to any directory that is in the
system path.

If you are running the Exchange Administrator program remotely and you do not
have the Rpcdce4.dll file in your system path, you should obtain it from the
Linkage\Redist directory on the connector computer, and put it in any directory
that is in your Windows NT 4.0 system path.
