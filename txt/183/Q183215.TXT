SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications MeaningList property,
you may receive the following error message:

   Run-time error '451' Object not a collection.

CAUSE
=====

You may be setting and using an object variable in conjuction with the
MeaningList property as in the following example Visual Basic for Applications
code,

      Set oSynonymInfo = ActiveDocument.Content.SynonymInfo

and then calling the property as follows:

      Msgbox oSynonymInfo.MeaningList(1)

Because Visual Basic for Applications treats the "(1)" in "MeaningList(1)" as a
parameter being passed to MeaningList, rather than an index to the MeaningList
array, the error described in the symptoms section of this article may occur.

To work around this problem, access the MeaningList array directly without first
setting it to a variable. The following two examples successfully use the
MeaningList property to return the meaning of a word from the thesaurus.

Example 1
---------

The following sample macro allows you to index the array:

      The following sample macro allows you to index the array:

      Sub TellMeaning()
         'Insert a word into the active document
         ' removing all other text.
         ActiveDocument.Content.Text = "pretty"

         'Displays the first meaning of the word in the document.
         MsgBox ActiveDocument.Content.SynonymInfo.MeaningList(1)
      End Sub

Example 2
---------

The following sample macro returns the first synonym for the selected text and
traps the error if the word has no definition in the thesaurus.

      Sub TellMeaning()

         On Error Resume Next
         ' Displays the first meaning of the word in the document.
         MsgBox Selection.Range.SynonymInfo.MeaningList(1)

         ' Check for likely automation errors.
         If Err.Number = 9 Then  'SUBSCRIPT OUT OF RANGE
            ' Tell user what happened. Then clear the Err object.
            MsgBox "No Definition"
            Err.Clear   ' Clear Err object fields.
         End If

      End Sub
