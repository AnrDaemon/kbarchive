KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When attempting to start an Internet browser from the Microsoft Exchange
MacIntosh client by selecting a URL from within a mail message, it is possible
that the Internet browser will not start.

One possible cause is that two Internet browsers have been installed. The
Exchange Macintosh Client will attempt to use the first Internet browser
installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Remove all Internet browsers installed on the Macintosh.

2. Reinstall the Internet browser you prefer to use.

3. Reinstall the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh Client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view which Internet browser the client is trying to access:

1. Back up the Exchange Preferences file located in the System
   Folder/Preferences directory. This is a precautionary step in case the
   preferences are corrupted or changed while using ResEdit.

2. Start ResEdit.

3. Within ResEdit, open the Exchange Preferences file.

4. Double-click on the file STR#.

5. Double-click on Options.

6. For Microsoft Internet Explorer, line 2 should read Browser=:MSIE:APPL.
