   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 to IIS 4.0 or
install the Windows NT Option Pack, the Active Log Format drop-down list box in
Internet Service Manager (ISM) is empty or not populated.

CAUSE
=====

IIS 4.0 uses a new logging format that is extensible. You may have to re-
register some of the logging DLL files, if the Setup program does not register
them.

NOTE: The logging modules are implemented as COM objects.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To restore the list of log formats, run the following three commands from a
command prompt in the <%SystemRoot%>\System32\Inetsrv directory:

   regsvr32 iislog.dll
   regsvr32 iscomlog.dll
   regsvr32 logui.ocx
   regsvr32 cnfgprts.ocx


MORE INFORMATION
================

To locate the Active log format drop-down list box in the ISM, view the
properties of a web site, and then click the Web Site tab.
