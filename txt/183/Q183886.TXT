TITLE   :Access Violation in LSASS When Logging on System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When logging on to a computer immediately after restarting it, you receive an
access violation in Lsass.exe that causes the security subsystem to fail,
rendering the computer inoperable until you restart it. The error occurs only if
you log on immediately after the CTR+ALT+DEL prompt appears. If you wait a few
minutes, the logon attempt will be successful.

CAUSE
=====

A timing issue that prevents Netlogon from reading the cached domain list from
the registry causes this error. Netlogon fails to obtain a handle to the
registry, and then attempts to use the uninitialized handle to read in a value,
causing the access violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
