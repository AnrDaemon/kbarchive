TITLE   :Dr.Watson Error When Renaming Printers Remotely on WinNT 3.51
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remotely rename a printer on a server running Windows NT 3.51 from a
server running Windows NT 4.0 using a remote printer folder, Printman.exe will
display a Dr. Watson access violation (0xc0000005) error message.

CAUSE
=====

The GUI of the Printers folder on Windows NT Server 4.0 and Workstation 4.0
allows up to a 260-character string for a printer name. If the name of a printer
that exists on a Windows NT 3.51 server is changed remotely to a name that
contains more then the 259 character limit, Printman.exe and Spoolss.exe on the
Windows NT 3.51 server will display a Dr. Watson message.

If you remotely change the printer name for a printer that exist on Windows NT
4.0 to the maximum amount of characters that the GUI allows (260), the name will
be truncated to 259 characters. This problem does not occur on Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, avoid typing in the maximum amount of 260
characters when renaming printers through a remote printer folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
