SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Discussion Wizard for Microsoft FrontPage is a wizard
that allows you to create a discussion Web site or add discussion to an existing
Web site, without writing any Active Server Pages (ASP) or HTML script. This
utility is included on the Exchange Server version 5.5 CD in the
\server\support\collab\fpwiz subdirectory and can be installed by running the
Discwiz.exe program. The utility is also available on the Web aat the following
location:

Or it can be found by querying "discwiz.exe" from the Microsoft Web page:

   http://www.microsoft.com/

in the Microsoft web or

The Microsoft Exchange Discussion Wizard differs from the basic discussion wizard
included with Microsoft FrontPage in that it stores messages and documents on an
Exchange Server computer. This provides benefits over a Web- only accessible
discussion group.

Because discussion data is stored in an Exchange information store, both Web
users and Microsoft Outlook users can participate in the same discussion and
share information.

You can create views on Microsoft Exchange folders that are also available to
both Microsoft Outlook and Web users.
