TITLE   :XFOR: File Status Table Contains Invalid Entry; Dirsync Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A time stamp in the file status table (Filestat.tbl file) may contain a seconds
field that is set to 100 hundredths of a second, even though you did not modify
the Filestat.tbl file manually. If you attempt to perform directory
synchronization (dirsync) between Microsoft Exchange Server and Lotus Notes
using this Filestat.tbl file, directory synchronization may fail. The directory
synchronization log may contain entries similar to the following:

 - DXM(0093) 4 68000:DX Agent ENTUSHUB(DXAVM) starting

 - DXM(0093) 4 00020:Warning {Not found} - Could not obtain the value of the FST
   keyword in the LME-PROFS-DXA section. Using the default value
   'DXAVM\FileStat.tbl'

 - DXM(0093) 1 68344:{Buffer too small} - Could not initialize the FSTLoad
   subsystem

 - DXM(0093) 4 04117:Queue item q\dxa.in\5000092A.rdy in queue dxa.in has been
   marked as bad

 - DXM(0093) 4 68009:DX Agent ENTUSHUB(DXAVM) ending: {Buffer too small}

 - DXM(0093) 1 62302:Error {Buffer too small}: Inbound processing failed

 - DXM(0093) 1 62112:DX Manager failed: {Buffer too small}

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in LinkAge Message Exchange that can cause a time stamp in
the Filestat.tbl file to contain a seconds field that is set to 100 hundredths
of a second. Because the entry in the Filestat.tbl file is too long, directory
synchronization may fail.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rename the Filestat.tbl file, then start dirsync.
The file will only be automatically recreated after dirsync is started. It will
not be automatically recreated by starting the dirsync process in the LinkAge
administrator, or by stopping and starting the LinkAge directory service in the
Control Panel Services tool.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Linkage Message Exchange version
3.2.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Filestat.tbl file can also contain an entry that is too long if you modify
the file manually.
