TITLE   :XCON: Interop Issue with Lowercase PAB Address, Softswitch LMS
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting Microsoft Exchange Server to Softswitch LMS through a Microsoft
Mail Connector, you may experience the following problem:

If an Exchange user sends a message to two Microsoft Mail addresses in lowercase
characters created in his or her personal address book, this can cause the
Softswitch LMS server to fail to deliver the message to one of the recipients.

This occurs when both the To: and Cc: fields are filled. The recipient in the To:
field receives the message, but not the recipient in the Cc: field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
