TITLE   :CCSID In The Data Source Does Not Override Driver's Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a CCSID is removed from the Host Column Description (HCD) with a text
editor, tracing reveals that the column still shows as 037 even though the data
type is binary (or another type) and the Data Source CCSID and the Driver CCSID
are something other than 037.

When the column description is removed all together, a default of 65535 is shown
by tracing, even though the Data Source CCSID and the Driver CCSID are something
other than 65535.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft OLE DB Provider for
AS/400 and VSAM version 1.00 included with SNA Server version 4.0.
