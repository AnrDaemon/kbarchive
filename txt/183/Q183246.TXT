KEYWORDS:kbToolkit kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbOSWinCE100 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
 - Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Although Windows CE does support printing, this functionality was not
incorporated into the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 (VBCE) or eMbedded
Visual Basic 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Printers collection, Printer object, and PrintForm method are not available
in VBCE or eVB.

There are several alternative methods that you can use:

 - · Print via an ActiveX component made in either the Windows CE Toolkit for
   Visual C++ (VCCE) or with eMbedded Visual C++. This control must be made by
   the developer or purchased from a third-party vendor.

 - Create a file to be printed, synchronize the file to the desktop computer,
   and print the file from the desktop.

 - Send text to the printer via the serial/IR port. If necessary, include
   appropriate printer commands (escape codes).

 - Create a text file. Open and print the text file in Pocket Word.

NOTE: The VBCE Common Dialog Box control released with the Microsoft Windows CE
ActiveX Control Pack does not support functions related to printing.
