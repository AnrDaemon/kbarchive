TITLE   :XADM: Access Violation in Store.exe
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Store.exe suddenly stops with an access violation. If Dr. Watson is active as
the default debugger, then a Dr. Watson log and a User.dmp (if configured to
create a User.dmp) may be produced.


CAUSE
=====

In very rare circumstances, it is possible that two threads can gain access to
the same lock. This can cause problems for the second thread when it attempts to
access the memory held by the lock after the first thread frees the lock.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.


This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the Service Pack,
