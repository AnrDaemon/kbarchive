The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a text file, the font may not be what you expect (the font is
assigned randomly). This behavior occurs when your system and your printer lack
a Courier font.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because text files are automatically given the Plain Text
style; by default, this style uses Courier New.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, modify the Plain Text style and specify the font you
want to use. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Style.

2. Under list, select All Styles.

3. Scroll through the list of styles and click Plain Text.

4. Click Modify.

5. Click Format, and click Font.

6. Select the desired Font, and then click OK.

7. Click to select the Add To Template check box, click OK, and then click
   Apply.

The text, which is imported in Plain Text Style, should be imported in the newly
defined Font.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
