PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Host Account Cache database service (Snaudb.exe) may get into a state where
it shows a very high CPU utilization. Tools such as Windows NT Performance
Monitor or Task Manager can be used to view CPU utilization for active
processes.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Account Cache database service can get into a loop when one of its
timeout routines tries to access a memory block that had been released with a
free() call. CPU utilization for this service jumps while it is stuck in this
loop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
