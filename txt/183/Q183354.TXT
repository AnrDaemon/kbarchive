TITLE   :XCLN: Unable to Attach Files with Long File Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to attach a file with a long file name, the following error message
appears:

   The file could not be opened.

This message appears when you try to attach files with file names of 12 or more
characters and the file does not reside on the local computer. Most often, the
symptom occurs when the file is on a UNIX or Novell server.

CAUSE
=====

Win32 API suggests that a truncated short file name appear in a separate field
when a long file name is being accessed from a server. The field for the
truncated short file name was empty in this case; therefore, the returned file
name was used as a short file name. This resulted in an inability to open the
file, because the name was actually a long file name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - Copy the file to your local hard disk, and then attach it to the message.

 - Use an 8.3 file name on the server.

 - Use the Exchange 4.0 client.

 - Use the Outlook client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Windows NT
client version 5.0.
