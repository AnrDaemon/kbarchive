SYMPTOMS
========

When you issue queries using the sample NNTP query form that is shipped with
Index Server 2.0, you may receive a result set that contains blank cells in the
result table.

CAUSE
=====

The code for the query form does not take into consideration that the default
catalog is set to index both newsgroup articles and documents contained on the
web server. The blank entries in the table are actually documents that were
found on the web site that match the query. Because non- NNTP documents do not
have the properties that are displayed on the result page, the cells are
populated with null data.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you either need to create a separate catalog that
indexes only NNTP articles, or modify the code of the NNTP sample search form so
that it only returns documents with .nws extensions. The modification to the
existing code is to modify the Q.Query line as follows:

      Q.Query = "(" & CompSearch & ") and #filename *.nws"
