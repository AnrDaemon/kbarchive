TITLE   :FIX: Problems with @GETS and CLEAR GETS If No READ
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An @...GET text box control does not remain visible.

CAUSE
=====

This is known to happen in Visual FoxPro 5.x when the @...GET is cleared with
the CLEAR GETS command before it has been activated with a READ command.

RESOLUTION
==========

One possible resolution is to issue a READ TIMEOUT .001 after the @...GET prior
to the CLEAR GETS command. Please see the sample program in the Steps to
Reproduce Behavior section below for an example.

A better solution would be to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style
programming with a Text box control. Implementing this workaround would depend
on the situation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Prior to Visual FoxPro, @...GET controls activated by a READ were the primary
method that a programmer used in a user interface for users to enter information
into a table (in addition to a BROWSE window) or a memory variable. The @...GET
controls included text boxes, edit boxes, combo boxes, list boxes, and other
controls. The @...GET controls need to be activated by a READ command before
they can be used to enter data.

The CLEAR GETS command releases all pending @...GET controls.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The program code below can be used to reproduce the problem.

1. Enter the following program code into a new program file and save it with the
   name GetProb.prg:

         CLEAR
         x="This is a test"
         y="Test 2"
         @ 5,5 GET x
         *    READ TIMEOUT .001     && Uncomment this for a workaround.
         CLEAR GETS
         @ 7,10 GET y
         READ

2. Run the program with the following command in the Command window:

         DO GetProb.prg

3. When you notice that only one of the @...GETs stays visible on the Visual
   FoxPro desktop, press TAB or ENTER to clear the READ and return to the
   Command window.

4. Uncomment the READ TIMEOUT .001 command and rerun the program. Note that the
   first @...GET displaying "This is a test" remains visible.
