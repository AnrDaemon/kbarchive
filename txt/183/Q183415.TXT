TITLE   :XFOR: NNTP JIS Message Converted to SJIS, Displayed Incorrectly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, Japanese version 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you compose a message using a double-byte character set (DBCS) and then post
the message to a public folder that is configured as a newsgroup with a default
character set of JIS, the message may be converted to SJIS when you open it in
an e-mail client. As a result, the message is displayed incorrectly. This
problem only occurs if you post the message in Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) plain text format, instead of encoding it using UUENCODE.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur for the following reasons:

 - If the message contains a Request for Comments (RFC) 1522 header, the
   character set for which the newsgroup is configured is ignored.

 - If the character set for which the newsgroup is configured is used, the
   Internet codepage may be set incorrectly. The Internet codepage may be set to
   the Microsoft Exchange Server codepage instead of the Windows codepage.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Japanese
Server version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
