-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 
 - Indexing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Index Server automatically generates abstracts for documents during the indexing
process. However, the abstracts it creates may not contain the information you
want.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For HTML documents, a META tag can be included that Index Server will use as the
abstract for the document. The format is as follows:

   <META NAME="description" CONTENT="Abstract text">

Index Server uses the content string as the abstract, instead of automatically
creating a content string based on document content.
