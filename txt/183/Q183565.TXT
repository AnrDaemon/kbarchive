TITLE   :Underlyingvalue Property Incorrect for Certain Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ADO property Underlyingvalue is often incorrect, generally with 8-bit ASCII
characters. For example, ASCII character #162, the "cents" symbol, appears as o
with a forward-accent in the underlying value property.

CAUSE
=====

The client codepage is set to 437 (ASCII) instead of 1252 (ANSI) and, therefore,
does not handle special characters.

Additionally, the OLE DB Provider does not accept 4-digit code-page numbers. The
OLE DB Provider does not support conversion to the system's default ANSI code
page.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft OLE DB Provider for
AS/400 and VSAM version 1.00, included with Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
