======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access files on a Directory File System (Dfs) sharepoint, the system
will crash with the following error:

   Stop: 0x00000082 (0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000)
   DFS_File_System

CAUSE
=====

File sharing problems can occur when the InocuLAN driver scans a file at the
same time as other applications are trying to access it. This is a problem with
the driver INO_FLTR.SYS in InocuLAN 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply InocuLAN 4.0 Service Pack 2 when it becomes available or contact Cheyenne
Technical Support.
