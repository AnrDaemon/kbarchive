SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word 97 Help, the following example in the "Field Codes: =
(Formula) field" help topic is incorrect.

   Field                Result
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

   { =(Table3 C3) }     The contents of the cell in the third column
                        of the third row of the table marked by the
                        bookmark "Table3."

The correct formula should be as follows:

   { =SUM(Table3 C3) }

NOTE: The formula must contain a function. For example, SUM, PRODUCT, and Average
are functions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you need to reference or calculate table cells in your document outside of
the table, you can use the Formula field. The following are examples how to use
the Formula field correctly.

To set up a sample table, follow these steps:

1. On the Table menu, click Insert Table.

2. In the Insert Table dialog box, set the Number of Columns to 3 and the Number
   of Rows to 5 and then click OK.

3. In cell B5, type the number 8 and in cell C5, type the number 10.

   For example, our sample table looks like the following:

      Row      COLUMN
      ---    -----------

             A    B    C

           +----+----+----+
       1   |    |    |    |
           +----+----+----+
       2   |    |    |    |
           +----+----+----+
       3   |    |    |    |
           +----+----+----+
       4   |    |    |    |
           +----+----+----+
       5   |    |  8 | 10 |
           +----+----+----+

4. Set a bookmark on the sample table. To do this,

   a. Place the insertion point somewhere in the table. For example, move the
      insertion point into cell A1 of the table.

   b. On the Table menu, click Select Table.

   c. On the Insert Menu, click Bookmark.

   d. In the Bookmark name box, type a name for the table, and then click Add.

      NOTE: In our example, Table1 is used as the bookmark name for the sample
      table.

Example 1: To Reference a Cell Outside the Table
------------------------------------------------

To reference a table cell outside of the table in your document, use the
following steps:

1. Move the insertion point in your document outside of the table.

2. Press CTRL+F9 to enter type the field code braces ({}).

3. Inside the field code braces, type the following Formula field:

   { =SUM(Table1 B5) }

4. With the insertion point inside the field code braces, press F9 to update the
   field.

5. Press ALT+F9 to turn the field codes off. The result of the Formula field
   should show.

Example 2: To Add Two Cells Outside of the Table
------------------------------------------------

To add two cells from the same table, such as in our example, cell B5 and C5, use
the following steps:

1. Move the insertion point in your document outside of the table.

2. Press CTRL+F9 to type the field code braces ({}).

3. Inside the field code braces, type the following Formula field:

   { =SUM(Table1 B5)+ SUM(Table1 C5) }

4. With the insertion point inside the field code braces, press F9 to update the
   field.

5. Press ALT+F9 to turn the field codes off. The result of the Formula field
   should appear.
