======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

At runtime, when the OLE DB Provider tries to access a field of more than 32,745
bytes, it hangs.

CAUSE
=====

The mainframe IBM DFM manual states that, for SAM data sets and PDSE members,
the maximum length of fixed-length records is 32,760 bytes and for
variable-length records is 32,756 bytes. For VSAM data sets, the manual states
the maximum record length is 32,760 bytes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft OLE DB Provider for
AS/400 and VSAM version 1.00, included with SNA Server version 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
