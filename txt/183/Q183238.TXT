======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA Server using SNARAS may log the following errors in the Windows NT
Application event log when dialing out to establish an SNARAS connection:

   

   Event ID: 101
   Description: SNARAS - Bad in use count in correlator. Got 0x200000
   expected 0x0.

   Event ID: 102
   Description: SNARAS - No Line CB attached to Anchor entry 0.

   Event ID: 201
   Description: SNARAS - Internal  error: File
   c:\src30\snaras\win32\srline.c at line 184

The event 201 occurs after an event 101 or 102 has been logged. After the event
201 has been logged, SNARAS will not function until the Windows NT server is
restarted.

CAUSE
=====

The event 201 is caused by a race condition that occurs when restarting an
SNARAS connection before the initial connection was properly closed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.
