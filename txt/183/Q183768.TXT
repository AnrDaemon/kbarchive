The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use MapiSend.exe from a command prompt to send an e-mail message, you
may receive one of the following error messages:

   Error: MAPI MapiSend Failed: 14

   Error: MAPI MapiSend Failed: 21

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to ambiguous name resolution.

If the sender's mailbox alias is ambiguous, the following error occurs:

   Error: MAPI MapiSend Failed: 14

If the recipient's mailbox alias is ambiguous, the following error occurs:

   Error: MAPI MapiSend Failed: 21

WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that the mailbox aliases for the sender and the recipient are not
ambiguous.

To test for ambiguity of names, perform the following steps:

1. Type the recipient's (or sender's) name in the To box of a Microsoft Outlook
   or Exchange Client standard Send form.

2. Click the To button or use the CTRL+K keystroke to see if the names are
   immediately resolved. If they are resolved without any prompting, they are
   not ambiguous.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MapiSend.exe is a Resource Kit utility that allows a user to send messages
with optional file attachments through Microsoft Exchange Server from a Windows
NT or Windows 95 command prompt.

NOTE: MapiSend.exe was formerly known as the Command-Line Mail Sender Tool
