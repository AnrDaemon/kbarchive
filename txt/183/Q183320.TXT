The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you view the Internet Mail Service properties in Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 administrative tools after adding a version 5.5 server to a site that
contains only version 5.0 server, you may receive the following error message:

   Extension 'SMTP' could not be loaded.

   An error occurred during file replication. Unable to find the
   extension .DLL file with the correct version number. To view details
   of the error, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event
   Viewer on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   ID no:c1030ad1

The event log may contain the following error:

    Event ID - 2037
    The file version of '\add-ins\SMTP\i386\imcadmin.dll' installed on
    the local server is not current. Unable to locate a correct version
    on any server in the site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Server 5.0 directory schema is changed after adding a computer
running Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 to the site. To view the Internet
Mail Service properties in Exchange Server 5.0, you must have version 5.5 of the
Imcadmin.dll file.

The first time you view the Internet Mail Service properties in version 5.0
administrative tools, it will replicate the version 5.5 Imcadmin.dll file to
your Exchange Server 5.0 in the following location:

   \Exchsrvr\Add-Ins\Smtp\I386\Imcadmin.dll

RESOLUTION
==========

Access the Internet Mail Service properties in each Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0 in the site. This ensures that the version 5.5 Imcadmin.dll file has
replicated to the server correctly.
