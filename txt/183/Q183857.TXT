KEYWORDS:word97 kbwdinternet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

The "Save As HTML" command is missing from the File menu. Additionally, "HTML
document (*.htm,*.html,*.htx)" is not an available option when you try to save
your Web page.

NOTE: This problem may occur even when the HTML converter is already installed
and the Html32.cnv file is present in the TextConv folder.

CAUSE
=====

The HTML converter may not be installed or may not be correctly registered.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one or more of the following methods appropriate for your situation.

Method 1: Install the Web Page Authoring Component
--------------------------------------------------

To resolve this issue, install the Web Page Authoring component in Microsoft
Office 97. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Quit all Office programs.

2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

4. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click to select Microsoft Office 97. (If you
   are using a stand-alone version of one of the Office programs, click to
   select the appropriate product in the list.) Then, click Add/Remove.

5. Follow the directions provided in the Setup dialog boxes.

For more information about starting Microsoft Office Setup, click the Office
Assistant, type "Installing Microsoft Office" (without quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to select the "Install or remove individual components"
topic.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q120802 Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office Program or Component

Method 2: Re-register Word or Office Setup with the /y Switch
-------------------------------------------------------------

To resolve this issue, try running Setup /y for Word or Office to repair registry
corruption.

To run Setup with the /y switch, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Word or Office CD into the CD drive. If you installed Word or
   Office from floppy disks, insert the Setup Disk 1 in your computer's floppy
   disk drive.

2. Click the Start button and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following

   <drive>:\setup /Y

   where <drive> is the letter of the drive that contains the CD or Setup
   Disk 1.

4. Click OK.

5. Click Reinstall.

   This will re-register Word (and all Office programs, if you run Office Setup).

If these steps don't correct the problem, you may need to remove Word, run
OffClean found on the Microsoft Office CD within the ValuPack folder and then
reinstall Word.

For additional information about OffClean, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Method 3: Modify the Windows Registry

Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in

you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

   OK.
