TITLE   :Using Multilink and ISDN Adapter Second Channel Does Not Connect
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kbnetwork win95

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use multilink with an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
adapter to make a connection that requires two different phone numbers separated
by an ampersand character (&), the ampersand may be removed, and the second
channel may not connect. The primary channel may connect properly, although data
is transferred at a reduced throughput (the maximum throughput for a single ISDN
channel is 64Kbps).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following steps:

1. Double-click My Computer, and then double-click the Dial-Up Networking
   folder.

2. Right-click the connection that uses the ISDN device, and then click
   Properties.

3. On the General tab, click the "Use area code and Dialing Properties" check
   box to clear it, and then click OK.

4. Double-click the connection to verify that both numbers are now being dialed
   correctly, and then close the Dial-Up Networking folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have a Motorola BitSURFR ISDN device, you may need to perform the
following additional steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Modems.

2. On the General tab, click your ISDN device, and then click Properties.

3. On the connection tab, click Advanced, and then type the following text in
   the Extra Settings box:

   %A2=95%A4=0@B0=2

4. Click OK, click OK, click OK, and then close Control Panel.

Note that you may also experience problems dialing with a single modem if the
dialing string contains an ampersand character.
