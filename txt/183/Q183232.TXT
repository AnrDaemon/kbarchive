 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure multiple network adapters to use the Microsoft Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), you may experience any of the
following symptoms:

 - Network names may not be resolved correctly if you are using the Windows
   Internet Name Service (WINS).

 - When you try to log onto a remote domain by using the Remote Access Service
   (RAS), you may receive the following error message:

   No domain controller was available to validate your logon.

 - When you try to use the NET USE command at a command prompt in Windows 95,
   you may receive the following error message:

   Error 53: The computer name specified in the network path cannot be located.
   Make sure you are specifying the computer name correctly, or try again later
   when the remote computer is available.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use static Internet Protocol (IP) addressing on a
network and then assign a static WINS address. When you do so, Dial-Up
Networking defaults to the static WINS address instead of the address assigned
by RAS, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, install the following updated file for Windows 95:

   Ws2setup.exe version 4.71.0030.1 (dated 2/27/98)

This update is available from the following Microsoft Web site:

MORE INFORMATION

When you configure multiple network adapters to use Microsoft TCP/IP, this
configuration is known as multihoming. For more information about multihoming,
