TITLE   :DHCP Server Does Not Provide Options to Remote Boot Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your diskless workstations (or other devices), that use Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to obtain IP address information and BOOTP file
and server information, may not obtain the DHCP options that are configured in
the client's DHCP reservation.

CAUSE
=====

Some DHCP clients do not request any option parameters in their DHCPDISCOVER
packet or their DHCPREQUEST packet. Windows NT DHCP server expects the client to
request the necessary options in either the DHCPDISCOVER or the DHCPREQUEST
packet. Windows NT DHCP server will not provide any option parameters unless
specifically requested by the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51,
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post additional information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
