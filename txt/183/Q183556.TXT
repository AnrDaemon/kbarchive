TITLE   :SNADDM Service Fails If Install Directory Path Is Too Long
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the path specified for the install directory for SNA Server 4.0 and OLE DB
Provider for AS/400 and VSAM 1.0 is too long, the SNA DDM Service will not start
properly. In one example, the path name specified during installation is 107
bytes long. This is the longest allowed by the installation process. After
rebooting the computer, the following message box appears:

   Title: Service Control Manager
   Text: At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use
   Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

The following entry was written to the System event log:

   Event ID: 7022
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: The SNA DDM Service hung on starting.

The following entry was written to the Application event log:

   Event ID: 0
   Source: SNA DDM Service
   Type: Error
   Category: None
   Description: The description for Event ID ( 0 ) in Source ( SNA DDM Service )
   could not be found. It contains the following insertion string(s): DDM Agent
   error: 126, Cannot initialize SNA DDM Service.

When you view the status of the service by opening Control Panel and double-
clicking the Services icon, the status shows that the SNA DDM Service is
started.

WORKAROUND
==========

Uninstall SNA Server 4.0, and then reinstall it with the OLE DB Provider for
AS/400 and VSAM 1.0 using a short install path.
