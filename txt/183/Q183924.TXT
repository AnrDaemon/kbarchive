TITLE   :XADM: Slow Client Performance While Performing Store Operations
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to perform client functions related to the information store, such
as opening a message, sending a message, opening a folder, and so on, you may
experience long delays. There will be no errors in the application event log,
and performance monitoring will not reflect any problem with Exchange Server.

CAUSE
=====

Either the Exchange Server information store is not optimally configured, or the
Limit memory usage to... option has been selected in the Exchange Optimizer and
has been set too low.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run the Exchange Optimizer to optimally configure
the Exchange Server computer, information store, and directory services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The symptoms above are generally related to the number (#) of information store
buffers being set too low. This condition is corrected either by running the
Exchange Optimizer or by removing the Limit Memory option in the Exchange
Optimizer.

The Exchange Optimizer creates a log file (in text format) called Perfopt.log,
which is found in the <winnt root>\system32 directory.

The Perfopt.log file contains statistics from each optimization and appends to
itself; therefore the last optimization log will be at the bottom of this file.

The following is an example of a re-optimized information store that corrected
slow client problems. The Perfopt.log file will include similar information
regarding the information store buffer change:

   Set # of information store buffers from 463 to 8078
   Set # of directory buffers from 394 to 6882
