SYMPTOMS
========

The text in a Microsoft Draw object appears to be crushed together or
overlapping. When you edit the Microsoft Draw object by double-clicking it, the
text appears fine.

CAUSE

The Microsoft Draw object was resized disproportionately. Microsoft Draw is
unable to dynamically resize text if the entire object is resized unevenly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resize an object proportionally, select one of the resize handles on the
corner of the object and then drag to change the shape of the object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
