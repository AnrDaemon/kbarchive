TITLE   :Long Delays Trying to View Registry Values Edit Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a registry key value of binary data type that is fairly large
(approximately 100 KB), and you use Regedt32 to try and display the Value Editor
for the keys value by double-clicking the value, you may notice a considerable
delay.

CAUSE
=====

Value lengths are limited by available memory. Long values (more than 2048
bytes) should be stored as files with the filenames stored in the registry. This
helps the registry perform efficiently. Application elements such as icons,
bitmaps, and executable files should be stored as files and not be placed in the
registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

As a workaround, place all large application elements such as icons, bitmaps, and
executable in files and create registry values pointing to those files.
