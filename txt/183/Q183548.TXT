TITLE   :Update to Diag. Capture Remote Environment Not Recognized
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbBug kbISS

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Operation of COMTI's Diaganostic Capture mechanism requires the cooperation of
two Remote Environments (RE). One is the "real" RE, which is handling traffic
to-and-from the main frame. The other is the "capture" RE which is recording
this traffic in a recording file.

Changes made to the "real" RE while capture is in progress are ignored.

WORKAROUND
==========

Start the Microsoft Transaction Server Explorer and perform a shut down of
server processes. Subsequently, the changes to the "real" RE will be in effect.

1. Start Microsoft Management Console with the Transaction Server Explorer
   snap-in.

2. In the left pane, click on 'Microsoft Transaction Server'.

3. In the right pane, double-click on the 'Computers' folder.

4. In the right pane, right-click on the 'My Computer' icon.

5. Select 'Shut Down Server Processes'.

STATUS
