TITLE   :XCON: Store Access Violates After Upgrade to Exchange 5.0 SP 2
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Following the Service Pack 2 upgrade of an Exchange Server 5.0 computer, the
information store service may stop with an access violation. This problem often
occurs shortly after the Internet Mail Service is started.

CAUSE
=====

While processing Internet mail messages, the heap can be corrupted by a memory
allocation error. Later operations on the corrupt heap result in an access
violation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.0,
with SP2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
