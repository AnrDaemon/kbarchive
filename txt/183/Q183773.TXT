KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows 95, you may experience the following symptoms:

 - When you double-click the Speaker icon on the taskbar, the Volume Control
   tool may not open.

 - When you click Advanced on the Start Menu tab in the Taskbar Properties
   dialog box, you may receive the following error message:

   Can not find the file 'Explorer.exe' or one of its components. Make sure the
   path and filename are correct and that all required libraries are available."

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Windows folder in the PATH environment variable
is overwritten. This can occur if you log in to a NetWare server and your
NetWare login script uses the Map (MAP) command instead of the Map Insert (MAP
INS) command to map search drives.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your network administrator to modify the system
login script or the user login script to use the Map Insert command to map the
NetWare search drives.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about the NetWare Map command and search drives, consult
your NetWare product documentation.
