TITLE   :XADM: Internet Mail Service Error with 5.5 Added to Site
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you add a computer running Exchange Server 5.5 to an Exchange 4.0 or
Exchange 5.0 site, using the Administrator program from version 4.0 or 5.0, you
cannot see all properties for the Internet Mail Service (Internet Mail Connector
in 4.0). If you double-click on the Internet Mail Service, the following error
message appears:

   Extension SMTP could not be loaded. The specified Module could not be
   found.

However, the Internet Mail Service can be administered using the Exchange Server
5.5 Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

During the installation of an Exchange Server 5.5 computer into the Exchange 4.0
or 5.0 site, not all libraries required for a static link for run-time are
replicated over to the Exchange Server computers running 4.0 or 5.0, or to any
computer running the Administrator program from version 4.0 or 5.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Copy two files from the Exchange Server version 5.5 CD: Mfc42.dll and
   Msvcrt.dll.

2. Insert those files into the winnt\system32 directory on the computers running
   the Exchange 4.0 or Exchange 5.0 Administrator program. Because the
   Msvcrt.dll file is a C-Runtime file used for certain operating system time
   functions, a file lock will be established at startup.

3. If the computer is using NTFS, you must perform a parallel installation of
   Windows NT (in other words, install Windows NT into another directory or
   partition on the same computer). Then copy over the files into their
   appropriate location. If you are using FAT, go to MS-DOS and copy over the
   files.
