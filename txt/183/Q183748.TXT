SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message displays when you attempt to register an ActiveX
.dll file with RegSvr32.exe on another computer:

   DllRegisterServer in <File name>.dll failed.

The ActiveX .dll file was created with Visual Basic 5.0 and Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 2 or 3.

CAUSE

The computer receiving the ActiveX DLL contains a version of the file
MSVBVM50.DLL that is different from the computer that was used to create the
ActiveX .dll file.

RESOLUTION
==========

ActiveX .dll file. Version 5.00.4319 of MSVBVM50.DLL is shipped with Visual
Studio 97 Service Pack 2 and 3. With this version of MSVBVM50.DLL installed, you
should be able to successfully register your ActiveX .dll using RegSvr32.exe.
