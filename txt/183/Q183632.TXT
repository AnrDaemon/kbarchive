======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The report generation feature, which generates a data dictionary from a model
using Microsoft Word OLE Automation objects in Visual Modeler 1.0 and 1.1 was
removed from the menu in version 2.0. The functionality can be enabled by
modifying the vs.mnu file. This article explains how to add/enable the report
generation feature manually; however, it is not a supported feature and should
be used at your own risk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable the report generation menu option, use Notepad to edit the file
vs.mnu, found in the Visual Modeler installation directory. Add the following
lines to the top of the file:

      Menu Report
      {
         Separator
            Option "&Generate Report..."
            {
               RoseScript .\ReportGen.ebx
            }
      }

Save the file.

If Visual Modeler is running, you will need to shut it down and restart so the
new settings can take effect.

The Generate Report option now appears under Report on the Visual Modeler menu
bar.
