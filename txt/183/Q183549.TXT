TITLE   :DBCS Parameters Not Allowed When Importing COBOL
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Importing a COBOL source file will fail when the COBOL data declaration section
contains an item that is USAGE DISPLAY-1. This COBOL usage defines an item as a
Double Byte Character Set (DBCS) string. The following error is displayed in a
message box when you click the Next button on the COBOL Source File
Specification page in the COMTI Import COBOL Wizard:

   Text: Invalid syntax was found near:
   * 05 <variable-name> PIC G(n) USAGE IS DISPLAY-1.

After you click the OK button, the next wizard page is displayed and you can
choose either to cancel the Import process or to continue. If you choose to
continue, the unsupported COBOL statement is not displayed.

CAUSE
=====

PIC G USAGE IS DISPLAY-1 (DBCS) is not supported in this version of the COM
Transaction Integrator.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the unsupported statement is not part of the interface being defined, you can
continue the import and ignore the error message. If the unsupported statement
is part of the interface, then you will need to apply the supported fix
described below. It is not possible to send or receive DBCS characters with the
COM Transaction Integrator version 1.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
