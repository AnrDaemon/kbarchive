-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, if a custom toolbar is created and the
TableToOrFromText command is added to a button, the button image is not
displayed on the toolbar after it is customized. The toolbar shows a blank
button instead.

NOTE: The button still works as expected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, show the image with the button text. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize.

2. In the Customize dialog box, click the Commands tab.

3. Click the blank button on the custom toolbar you created.

4. In the Customize dialog box, click the drop-down arrow for Modify Selection,
   and then click Image And Text.

Or, add the command to a default toolbar like the Standard toolbar, instead of
the custom toolbar.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
