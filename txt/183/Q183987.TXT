TITLE   :PRB: SendData Method Generates Error 40006
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbnetwork kbAPI kbSDKPlatform kbVBp500 kbWinsock kbGrpDSVB kbGrpDSNet

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you call the SendData method in the WinSock control before the socket has
been connected, you will receive the Microsoft Visual Basic Error:

   Run-time error: 40006

   "Wrong protocol or connection state for the requested transaction or request."

CAUSE
=====

The code is trying to call the SendData method before the port has actually been
connected. The Connect method in Visual Basic is asynchronous and is more like a
request to connect to the Winsock port.

RESOLUTION
==========

The code must wait until the Connect event is fired before attempting to call
the SendData or GetData methods. The Connect event is a signal that the connect
request has been accepted and the connection is established.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce and Work Around Behavior
-------------------------------------------

1. Create a new project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. From the Projects menu, choose Components. Make sure that Microsoft Winsock
   Control 5.0 is checked, and then click the OK button.

3. Add a Winsock Control to the form and leave it named Winsock1.

4. Add a CommandButton named Command1.

5. Add the following code to the form:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Winsock1.SendData "Hello World."
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Command1.Enabled = False
            Winsock1.Connect InputBox$("Enter Server name:"), 7
            Command1_Click
         End Sub

         Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
            Winsock1.Close
         End Sub

         Private Sub Winsock1_Connect()
            Command1.Enabled = True
         End Sub

         Private Sub Winsock1_DataArrival(ByVal bytesTotal As Long)
            Dim temp As String
            temp = String(bytesTotal, Chr$(0))
            Winsock1.GetData temp, vbString, bytesTotal
            MsgBox temp
         End Sub

6. Execute the program. You should get error 40006 after entering a valid server
   name in the input box. When it fails, click on END.

7. Remove the line Command1_click from the Form_Load() sub, and run the program
   again. You should get a message box that says "Hello World."
