RESOLUTION

To resolve the problem, install the correct version of comcat.dll by completing
the following steps:

   Visual Basic or it may be found on the Visual Basic installation CD-ROM.

   To unregister, select Run from the Windows Start menu, type the following
   command line and click Ok:

   regsvr32 /u comcat.dll

2. Copy comcat.dll, version 4.71 (22k), from the
   ..\DevStudio\VB\Setupkit\kitfil32\sys32 directory or from your Visual Basic
   CD to the Windows\System or WinNT\System32 directory.

3. Use REGSVR32.EXE to register COMCAT.DLL. To register, click Run on the
   Windows 95 Start menu, type the following command line, and the click OK:

   regsvr32 comcat.dll

MORE INFORMATION
================

This should not be a problem on Windows 2000 because it is a protected system
file. Windows 2000 will detect any attempt to rename, delete or replace this
file and will put it back as it was.
