TITLE   :XADM: High CPU in Store.exe w/ Incorrectly Formatted Attachment
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbExchange500preSP3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you monitor the activity of Store.exe using various tools, including
Performance Monitor, Store.exe runs near or at 100 percent CPU usage.

CAUSE
=====

The messaging client is improperly formatting a message containing a MIME
attachment. This can occur for messages containing attachments that contain a
left parenthesis "(" within the file name but without the right or closing
parenthesis ")". This is interpreted as a comment rather then the file name, and
the store continuously searches for the closing parenthesis.

For example:

   --PART.BOUNDARY.mailhub.4aba.34918213.0001
   Content-Type: application/octet-stream
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=(JPEG-IM.BMP <-HERE *****
   Content-Description: (JPEG-IM.BMP
   FTBP-Modification-Date: 12 Dec 2017 10:02:00 Z
   FTBP-Object-Size: 167710

It is possible to check the files in the IMCDATA\IN or IMCDATA\OUT subdirectories
for the presence of messages that contain attachments with a ( in the file name.
These files are text files. There is no need to check the archive directories
underneath IN or OUT.
