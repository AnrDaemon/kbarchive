SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, Second Edition, includes the PAB-GAL
Synchronization Tool.

You can use the PAB-GAL Synchronization tool (Pabgsync.dll) to synchronize your
Personal Address Books (PABs) with the global address list on your Exchange
Server computer. The Pabgsync.dll tool writes a mail message in your Deleted
Items folder when synchronization is complete; the message contains a list of
all of the changes that were made during PAB-GAL synchronization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

More information regarding PAB-GAL Synchronization can be found in the
BackOffice Resource Kit online help documentation under:

   Exchange\Docs\Exchtool.hlp

PAB-GAL Synchronization Tool help topics include:

 - Installing the PAB-GAL Synchronization Tool

 - Using the PAB-GAL Synchronization Tool

 - Troubleshooting the PAB-GAL Synchronization Tool

The PAB-GAL Synchronization tool is intended to update address values, but not
address types.

NOTE: The PAB-GAL Synchronization Tool, like all Microsoft BackOffice Resource
Kit tools, is supported on a best-effort basis.
