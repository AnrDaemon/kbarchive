TITLE   :Problems Using Visual Basic Sample Program (ado_vb)
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Several problems occur when you try to use certain functions in the Visual Basic
sample program located in the following subdirectory:

     ..\sna\samples\ado_vb.

This is the list of problems:

 - Multiple error message dialog boxes appear for each error; that is, one for
   the Visual Basic (VB) error and one for each error in the Connection object's
   error collection.

 - Control buttons and menu items are enabled or disabled inappropriately.

 - After you use the Filter, Find, OpenRS, or Sort command, the next time the
   function is invoked, the input dialog box does not display the previous value
   used.

 - The tab order on the controls is wrong; that is, when you are editing a
   record, selecting a tab may move the cursor beyond the next text box.

 - When a remote command has completed successfully, the message from the AS/400
   is not returned to the application.

======

AS/400 and VSAM version 1.0, included with Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0.
