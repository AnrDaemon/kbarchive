-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When CONNECT:Direct for Windows NT is configured to operate on a separate
computer running Windows NT than the SNA Server, the host may fail to
successfully submit a job (for example, file transfer, automation operations,
and so forth) to the CONNECT:Direct workstation.

SNA Server version 3.0 and higher may post the following messages in the Windows
NT application Event Log:

   Event ID: 705
   Source: SNA Base Service
   Description: Logon Failed.
   Explanation: Connection request failed due to data security.
   GetChallengeResponse failed --- Error Code: C0000008H

   Event ID: 705
   Source: SNA Base Service
   Description: Logon Failed.
   Explanation: Connection request failed due to data security.
   RegisterLogonProcess failure --- Error Code: C0000041H

   Event ID: 705
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Logon Failed.
   Explanation: Connection request failed due to data security. Invalid
   Challenge Response --- Error Code: 002B000AH

CAUSE
=====

The CONNECT:Direct service running on the Windows NT workstation is configured
to operate under the Local System Account - therefore running with NULL
credentials. When the application service attempts to establish a session to SNA
Server after receiving the Attach (FMH-5) message from the host, it fails
because of security (lack of credentials).

The Attach message from the host may get processed successfully if the SNABASE
service is operating with appropriate credentials.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the CONNECT:Direct service to use a User Account and password instead
of the Local System Account or enable the Guest account on the SNA Server. The
user account must have the right to act as part of the operating system.
