SUMMARY
=======

When you create a new Web site, the site is not automatically marked as indexed
when you create a catalog for it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To correctly index a new Web site, follow these steps:

For Index Server 2.0

1. Make sure that the Web site has been created in the Internet Information
   Server snap-in.

2. In the Index Server snap-in, create a new catalog. After the catalog has been
   created, view the properties for it. On the Web tab, select the Web site that
   you want to index, and click OK.

3. Go back to the Internet Information Server snap-in, and select Properties on
   the Web site you are indexing.

4. On the Home Directory tab, select the Index This Directory check box, and
   click OK.

5. Stop the Index server, and then restart it. The new catalog should come
   online and begin indexing the new Web site.

For Windows 2000 Indexing Service

1. Make sure that the Web site has been created in the Internet Information
   Server snap-in.

2. In the Index Server snap-in, create a new catalog. After the catalog has been
   created, view the properties for it. On the Tracking tab, select the Web site
   that you want to index from the WWW Server pull-down menu, and then click OK.

3. Go back to the Internet Information Server snap-in, and select Properties on
   the Web site you are indexing.

4. On the Home Directory tab, select the Index This Resource check box, and
   click OK.

5. Stop the Index Service, and then restart it. The new catalog should come
   online and begin indexing the new Web site. In Windows 2000, Indexing Service
   does not need to be restarted. Stopping and restarting the catalog is enough.
