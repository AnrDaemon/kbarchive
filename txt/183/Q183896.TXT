TITLE   :XADM: Error Message When Installing Key Management Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing the Key Management (KM) Server, the following error
message may appear:

   "Unable to get information about the sites in your organization. Verify
   the NT account you are logged on as has Microsoft Exchange
   Administrative rights and you have access on the TEMP directory of this
   machine before running setup."

CAUSE
=====

The problem can be caused if the computer on which the KM Server is being
installed does not have a directory with the name TEMP.

WORKAROUND
==========

Sometimes the temporary directory is called TMP. In that case, to work around
the problem, create a new directory with the name TEMP. If you are running on
the NTFS file system, make sure that all users have full access to that
directory.

Before creating the TEMP directory, check the TEMP variable by going to Control
Panel, double-clicking the System icon, and then choosing Environment. The TEMP
directory should be created in the path that the TEMP variable is pointing to.
