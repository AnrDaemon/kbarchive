TITLE   :XFOR: 3 KB or Larger Attachments Cause PROFS Connector to Stop
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to send a message containing an attachment that is larger than 3
KB in size through the Microsoft Exchange PROFS Connector, and the associated
Microsoft SNA Server connection is configured for a frame size greater than 3
KB, the Exchange PROFS Connector may stop unexpectedly.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server that causes the SNA Server
computer to end all existing connections under these conditions. This causes the
Exchange PROFS Connector to stop unexpectedly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Configure the SNA Server connection so that the frame size is not greater
   than 3 KB.

 - Obtain the appropriate Microsoft Windows NT Server fix. For information about
   how to do so, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
