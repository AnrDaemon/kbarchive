KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a message contains multiple attachments and a user deletes one of the
attachments and then tries to save the message, the user will receive the
following error:

   An error occurred which prevents this message from remaining open,
   and changes cannot be saved. Do you want to copy the text in this
   message to the clipboard?

The same error may be encountered by a MAPI program if the application does the
following:

1. Opens the message.

2. Gets the attachment table.

3. Queries the attachment table.

4. Deletes an attachment.

5. Saves changes.

6. Queries the attachment table.

Result: The last query will return MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND.

This problem only occurs with Exchange Server 5.0 SP2. It is not present in
Exchange Server 5.0 SP1 or Exchange Server 5.5.

CAUSE
=====

The deleted attachment is not correctly removed from the attachment table.
