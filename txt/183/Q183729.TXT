The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To administer a remote computer running Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0
using Internet Service Manager (HTML), you must log on with a valid
administrator (or operator) account for that remote computer. If you want to
access Internet Service Manager (HTML) on a remote computer with a different
account, an account other than the one you used to log on to the local computer,
you must enable Basic Authentication and disable Windows NT Challenge/Response
authentication on the Directory Security property sheet for the Administration
Web site or the IISAdmin virtual directory. You will then be prompted for proper
user account credentials.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With previous releases, you could create a session to \\ServerName\IPC$ using a
different user account to get access. This will not work for IIS 4.0.
