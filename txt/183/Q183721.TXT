The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

If you have a .dll file with special dependencies that require these files to be
loaded before other Web server processes, you can create a registry- defined
list of those .dll files that are to be preloaded into the Inetinfo.exe program
before any other Web server services start up.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To preload .dll files, create a new registry key called PreloadDlls in the
following registry path:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Inetinfo\Parameters

Set this entry as type multi-sz, with data consisting of the names of the .dll
files that you want to preload (separated by carriage returns). If the files
reside in the same path, you can type just the name of the .dll file. If the
.dll file resides in another directory, type the file name and its full path.
