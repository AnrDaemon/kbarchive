The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange forms administrators may find it necessary at times to update an
existing Exchange form and reinstall it to a message store (for example, a
public folder). However, after a form has been cached locally on the Exchange
client workstation, the Exchange client may not always download the updated
version of the form from the message store.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways to ensure that the updated version of a form will be used on
the client:

Method 1:

From the Exchange client, select Tools, Options, Exchange Server page, Manage
Forms button. From the Forms Manager, select the folder by clicking the Set
button located in the right-pane list box. Choose the folder in which the
updated form is installed. Click the Update button.

For this method some type of notification is required, so that the user knows to
perform the above steps. One recommendation is to send a detailed message to all
those affected after a form has been updated.

Method 2:

From the Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer, load the form that is to
be updated. Select View, Form properties. From the General page, change the Item
Type to a unique name, different from the original. (Note: The item type must
remain in the form IPM.Vendorname or IPM.Vendorname.Subclass.)

For this method, the form is automatically downloaded, because this is a new item
type. However, unless the display name has been changed on the form, the
Exchange client's Compose menu will list multiple forms with the same display
name.
