TITLE   :Size Of Dynamic Output Array Always Set to Maximum
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Visual Basic programmer uses the UBound function to obtain a count of the
actual number of elements returned in an array, the result always indicates the
maximum possible value, even though fewer elements may actually have been
returned in the first (or only) array dimension.

CAUSE
=====

The COM Transaction Integrator creates the safe array that is returned to the
Visual Basic program. The dimension(s) of the returned array will always be set
to the maximum, because the COMTI runtime component has no means of determining
the actual number of elements returned without incurring excessive processing
overhead.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0 included with SNA Server version 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

   " S E R V P A C K " (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In Component Builder (CB), declare a method for which there is a parameter
   declared as an output array.

2. The parameter is the final output field returned.

3. The method's advanced properties specify that the "Final field from host is
   bounded." (Specifying the property, "Final field from host is bounded" for
   the method indicates that the number of values returned in the first array
   dimension can vary up to a specified maximum number.)

4. The front-end client program written in Visual Basic declares this array as a
   dynamic array.
