TITLE   :Unable to Locate Host Column Description File
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

By default, a Host Column Description (HCD) file is placed in the ..\sna\system
subdirectory when it is created using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
administration snap-in tool. If the HCD file is subsequently moved to another
directory, the admin tool cannot locate it. However, it is still located
properly at run time according to the path and file name used in the data source
definition.

CAUSE
=====


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, keep the HCD file(s) in the ..\sna\system
subdirectory. If it is necessary to leave the HCD file in the alternate
subdirectory, it may be edited manually using a text editor instead of editing
it with the administrative snap-in tool.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 4.0's OLE DB Provider
for AS/400 and VSAM version 1.00.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
