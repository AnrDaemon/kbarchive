TITLE   :XADM: Full Online Backup Must Be Done After a Defrag or Repair
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After a Microsoft Exchange database is defragmented or repaired off-line (by
running the Edbutil or Eseutil utilities), a full online backup must be
performed as soon as possible.

If the backup is not done, it could severely impact the ability to recover from a
disaster that occurs after the off-line defragmentation or repair was done.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the databases are defragmented or repaired, they get a new log signature.
As a result, any logs generated after the defragmentation (or repair) process
will be incompatible with the databases just as they were before the
defragmentation or repair process. Therefore, if a disaster occurs and you need
to restore before the next full online backup has been performed, you will not
be able to recover data generated after the defragmentation (or repair) because
the logs have a different signature. For this reason, it is very important that
you perform a full online backup immediately after you do a defragmentation (or
repair) of the database.
