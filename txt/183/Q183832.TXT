TITLE   :gethostname() Must Support Alternate Computer Names
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Cluster Server 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the gethostname function in Windows NT, it does not support the
ability to use alternate computer names for the computer.

CAUSE
=====

The gethostname function returns the node name instead of the cluster name in
the network name resource.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server, Enterprise
Edition version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The change that was made in GetComputerName to support alternate computer names
has been added to gethostname. GetComputerName checks an environment variable.
If that variable exists, GetComputerName returns its value instead of the real
computer name. The change was made to keep applications from breaking in a
cluster.
