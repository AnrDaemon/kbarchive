SYMPTOMS

following error:

   Failed to Reload the Project. Please close the project from the file menu and
   re-open it to get the correct versions of all the files loaded into memory.

CAUSE
=====

The .vbg file may have been added to SourceSafe, marking it read-only.

Please refer to the REFERENCES section for other articles relating to this error
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before opening the .vbg file, remove the read-only attribute. In addition, if
the .vbg file has been added to SourceSafe, delete it, making sure the "Destroy
permanently" option is checked. Placing the group file under source control is
currently unsupported.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
