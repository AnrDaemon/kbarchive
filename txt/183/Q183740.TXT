TITLE   :Key Manager Started from MMC Does Not Return Focus
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you display the properties of a Web site in the Microsoft Management
Console (MMC) and select the Directory Security, Secure Communications option,
you see a button labeled Key Manager or Edit, depending on whether you have
configured security previously. If you click the Key Manager or Edit button, the
Key Manager application starts. Focus will not be returned to the MMC unless you
first close Key Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Key Manager is being started as a child window of
the Properties dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you need to have Key Manager displayed while editing the properties of a Web
site, first close the Web site's Properties dialog box, and then click the Key
Manager icon on the MMC toolbar. This starts Key Manager as a separate
application. After it starts, you can bring up the Properties dialog box for the
Web site in the MMC.
