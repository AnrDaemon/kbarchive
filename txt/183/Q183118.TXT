TITLE   :Special Characters Disallowed in Transaction Program Name
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Host Names tab on the Method properties sheet in the COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS (COMTI) Component Builder does not allow periods in
the name.

CAUSE
=====

When you open the properties sheet and try to edit the TP Name, the problem can
occur. This is a bug in the code that handles entering a TP Name through the
method's Host Names Property page. Instead of checking for legal type AE
characters, the code is checking for the legal type A characters. Only the
alphanumeric characters $ (dollar sign), # (number sign), and @ (at sign) are
allowed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem you can use the Import Wizard because it correctly
handles the alphanumeric characters and allows periods to be entered. Also, the
code that reads a component into CB handles the name correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
