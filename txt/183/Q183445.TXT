======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Etk50pid.exe file is a patch that launches a revised Windows CE Embedded
Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0 setup, allowing proper product identification
(Product ID) numbers to be displayed (to view the Product IDs in Developer
Studio, on the Help menu, click About).

The Product ID number is necessary to access free support incidents that are
included with the toolkit. The Windows CE Embedded Toolkit for Visual C++ 5.0
setup may not have correctly added the product IDs (to view the Product IDs in
Developer Studio, on the Help menu, click About) so that you can refer to them
during a support call. These numbers may appear in the form
80923-xxx-xxxxxxx-55555. All of the x's should have been replaced by digits.

To install the patch, run Etk50pid.exe to extract the patch files into the system
temporary directory, and automatically start the Setup program. Proceed with the
setup as usual. When prompted, enter the CD key provided with your product.
Finally, select any install option and click Exit to complete the update.

This setup will NOT reinstall the product; you will need to reboot your computer.
