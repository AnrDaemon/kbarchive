TITLE   :Index Server 2.0 Fails to Install from Add/Remove
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 after Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) version 4.0 has been installed, you may receive the
following error message:

   IS failed to modify the metabase.

CAUSE
=====

This error message appears when the script map is larger than 2 KB. This is
usually the result of installing products that create duplicate script map
entries.

WORKAROUND
==========

To allow installation of Index Server, you must remove any duplicate or unused
entries from the script map and from the Web site master properties. To remove
entries from the script map, follow these steps:

1. In the Microsoft Management Console, go to the Properties dialog box for your
   Web site.

2. Select the Home Directory tab, and then click the Configuration button.

3. The Application Mappings dialog box should appear. Review the current
   mappings and remove any duplicates or mappings that you are not using.

To remove entries from the Web site master properties, follow these steps:

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) with the Internet Information
   Server (IIS) snap-in.

2. In the Internet Services Manager, right-click the server name and click
   Properties.

3. On the Home Directory tab, click Configuration and remove any duplicate
   entries.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Index Server version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Certain applications create duplicate script map entries for each Web site in
IIS. For example, if you have 50 Web sites, then you would end up with 50
identical mappings. The 2-KB script map limitation is only for installation of
Index Server.
