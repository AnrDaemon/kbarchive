TITLE   :BUG: Administrative Snap-in Allows Duplicate Names of HCD Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, used with:
    - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the administrative tool snap-in in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC),
you can create two identically named Data Description Files (host column
definition files, HCD files). (One physical file, so-named and having an .hcd
extension, appears in the ..\sna\system subdirectory.)

It is possible, using the administrative tool, to make changes to both files
listed in the MMC snap-in tree. However, when you do an MMC refresh, only one of
the previously listed files remains. The changes are combined in it.

The combined changes indicated in the snap-in also appear in the single physical
file in the ..\sna\system subdirectory.

There is an additional side-effect: A new file named New File.hcd appears in the
..\sna\system subdirectory and appears in the MMC snap-in tree list. It contains
only a [Stats] section with a date-time stamp.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem before it occurs, avoid defining Data Description
Files with duplicate names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft OLE DB Provider for
AS/400 and VSAM version 1.00, included with SNA Server version 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
