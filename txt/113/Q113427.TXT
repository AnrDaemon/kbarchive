TITLE   :FIX: Incorrect Optimization of Left Shift Operator
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCompilerkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
    - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Optimization of the left shift operator may generate incorrect code in loop
operations when compiled with global optimizations on. In the code sample below,
the "for" loop incorrectly evaluates the "count" variable. The resultant code
causes the loop to execute only once with the following output:

   0

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn off global optimizations (/Og). In the code sample below, turning off
global optimizations will correctly output:

   0
   40000000
   80000000
   C0000000

Global optimizations can be disabled by excluding /Og from the command-line
switches or by the use of a pragma:

      #pragma optimize ("g", off)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft C/C++ 32-bit
compiler, version 8.0, which is included with Visual C++ 32-bit Edition. This
problem was corrected in C/C++ compiler version 9.0, included with Visual C++
32-bit Edition, version 2.0

Sample Code
-----------

   /*
   * Compile options needed: /Og
   */ 

   #include <stdio.h>

   void main( void )
   {
       unsigned count;
        for ( count = 0 ; count < 4 ; count++ )
            printf(" %X \n", count << 30);
   }
