======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Voice Pilot icon is in the Startup group of Windows and the microphone
is turned on in Voice Pilot, you may receive the following error messages when
starting Windows:

   The device is being used by another application
   The device cannot write to aux.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the above error messages:

1. Place another application in the Startup group before the Voice Pilot icon.
   This will allow Windows enough time to initialize the Windows Sound System
   card before Voice Pilot tries to use the card.

   The icons placed in the Startup group load in the order they appear in the
   window. Therefore, Clock or any other application would have to be above
   and/or to the left of the Voice Pilot icon.

-or-

2. Turn the microphone off in Voice Pilot.
