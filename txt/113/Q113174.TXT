======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 7.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The logical result of an operation involving the NUMLOCK() and CAPSLOCK()
functions incorrectly returns a FALSE value when either function is used with
the logical expression operator and the second expression returns TRUE.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, you must use a nested IF statement if you are
going to use the result of either NUMLOCK() or CAPSLOCK() in conjunction with
another logical expression.

For example, the following code will correctly display the WAIT window message:

         * ensure the NUMLOCK key is on
         STORE .T. to istrue
         IF NUMLOCK()
            IF istrue
               WAIT WINDOW 'they are both true'
            ENDIF
         ENDIF

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To reproduce this behavior, use the following code example:

         * ensure the NUMLOCK key is on
         STORE .T. to istrue
         IF NUMLOCK() AND istrue
            WAIT WINDOW 'they are both true'
         ENDIF

Note that the WAIT window message does not appear as it should in this example.
