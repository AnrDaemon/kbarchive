The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply a template to an existing presentation file, the settings in the
Slide Setup dialog box for the presentation are not altered. For example, if the
template has a portrait orientation for its slides and you apply that template
to a presentation whose slides have a landscape orientation, the orientation is
not changed.

All of the other Slide Setup options remain unchanged as well:

   Slides Sized For
   Width
   Height
   Number Slide From
   Orientation

The Apply Template (version 3.0) and Presentation Template (version 4.0) commands
are designed to transfer the contents and formatting of the masters from one
presentation to another presentation.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to change an entire presentation based on an existing file's
template (masters) and Slide Setup, do one of the following:

 - Either apply the template and then change the Slide Setup of the presentation
   to match the Slide Setup of the file used as a Template.

   -or-

 - Copy all of the slides from the presentation to a new presentation that has
   the same master and Slide Setup as the template.
