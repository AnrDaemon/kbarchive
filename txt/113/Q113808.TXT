SUMMARY
=======

You can create generic SELECT statements that programmatically produce result
sets of records to be output for viewing in a number of ways. However, in
certain instances, a SELECT statement may not produce any records in the query
based on the SQL criteria provided.

To avoid having a program act upon an empty result, the system variable _TALLY
can be evaluated immediately after a query has been executed in order to
determine the number of records that have been selected. For more information
about _TALLY, see the code example below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following rudimentary example illustrates the usage of the _TALLY system
variable:

      * GENERIC.QPR
      *
      SET STATUS OFF && SET STATUS BAR OFF in FoxPro for Windows
      fyl = GETFILE('DBF','Choose a database:')
      USE (fyl)
      LIST STRUCTURE
      USE
      ACCEPT 'Enter field list, separated by commas (or ENTER for all):' ;
         TO flds
      IF EMPTY(flds)
         flds='*'
      ENDIF
      ?
      ACCEPT 'Enter conditions (or ENTER for none) ' TO cond
      IF EMPTY(cond)
         cond=''
      ELSE
         cond='WHERE '+cond
      ENDIF

      SELECT &flds FROM (fyl) &cond INTO CURSOR query NOCONSOLE

      IF _TALLY>0
         BROWSE
      ELSE
         WAIT WINDOW 'No matching records found...'
      ENDIF
