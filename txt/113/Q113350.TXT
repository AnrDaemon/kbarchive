Versions 4.0 and 4.1 of PowerChute Plus for Windows NT (American Power
Conversion's uninterruptible power supply management utility) sends out
broadcast messages to alert administrators and users of problems on the
UPS server. These broadcasts--equivalent to a NET SEND * and normally sent
to the names listed in ControlPanel->Network->Alerts--can generate enough
packets to cause problems on large networks.

American Power Conversion is aware of this and has slated a fix for
inclusion in release 4.2 of PowerChute Plus for Windows NT.
