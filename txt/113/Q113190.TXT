The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The sample Npclnt.exe in the Microsoft Download Center demonstrates the named
pipe client interface in Windows for Workgroups (WFW).

This sample provides a WFW named pipe client for the Win32 SDK named pipe sample
(NPSERVER). This sample opens, reads, and writes to the named pipe created by
the NPSERVER application. The DosReadAsyncNmPipe API is used to perform
asynchronous reads from the server's named pipe to avoid blocking under WFW.

NOTE: This sample has two problems.

 - The NP callback should be in a fixed code segment in a DLL.

 - Memory passed to DosReadAsyncNmPipe and DosWriteAsyncNmPipe should be fixed
   and pagelocked.

Care must be taken when using DosReadAsyncNmPipe or DosWriteAsyncNmPipe. Because
both APIs provide WFW a function pointer that is called at interrupt time, only
limited operations may be performed in the callback. The WFW SDK reference
states the following about the callback function:

   Generally, the callback function can set global variables and check the
   variable specified by the pusErrCode parameter for potential errors. But the
   callback function must not modify registers or call any MS-DOS system
   functions, BIOS functions, or C run-time functions that call MS- DOS and BIOS
   functions. Although the callback function can call the PostMessage function,
   it must not call the SendMessage function.

Also, the callback function must be exported in the application's *.DEF file.
Besides exporting, the application must call MakeProcInstance on the function
before calling the asynchronous API. Care must also be taken not to call
FreeProcInstance while a read or write is outstanding.
