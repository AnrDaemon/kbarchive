KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1994 edition, 1995 edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, 1995 Intro Edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you search on a word and then select one of the articles, the article appears
with the search word highlighted in the title and text. If you then close the
Find window (on the Tabbed List) the highlights in the found topic will
disappear. If you open the Find window again, the highlights will return.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Situation
----------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Find. Type a word, then click the Find button.
   Bookshelf will display the first article found in which the search word
   appears to the right of the Find window. The search word is highlighted where
   ever it appears in the article.

2. Close the Find window by clicking the little button in the upper-right corner
   of the Tabbed List. The List disappears, and so do the highlights.

   In Bookshelf 96, click the Contents tab to close the Find window.

3. Reopen the Tabbed List by clicking the Find tab at the left side of the
   Bookshelf window. The Tabbed List reappears, with the Find window up, and the
   highlights reappear as well.
