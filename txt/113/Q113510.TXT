BUG# ODBCDBASE: 2062 (1.01.1928)

SYMPTOMS
========

On certain Btrieve Tables, the following sequence of operations (or equivalent)
can generate a general protection fault (GP fault) in BTRV110.DLL:

1. Allocate a Env, Hdbc, and Stmt handle using SQLAllocEnv, SQLAllocConnect, and
   SQLAllocStmt respectively or an equivalent sequence of calls to prepare to
   execute a SQL statement.

2. Execute SQLExecDirect or SQLExecute to execute a selection query (select *
   from <tablename>).

3. A subsequent call to SQLFreeStmt with fOption = SQL_CLOSE.

The exact message of the error generated is:

   <Application name> caused a general protection fault in module
   BTRV110.DLL at 0011:0B7A.

NOTE: The conditions under which this can happen are highly dependent on the
combination of specific data in certain tables and the structure of the ddf
files.

WORKAROUND
==========

Try copying the data out and moving into another table. Run your query against
the new table.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in ODBC Btrieve Driver version
1.01.1928. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
