   Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Ndkwiz.exe is a self-extracting file that contains the following:

   Dksetup.prg - the revised Distribution Kit Setup Wizard program
   Required.dbf - a table used by the Setup program
   Readme.txt - the text of this article

Once you have obtained Ndkwiz.exe, type "ndkwiz" (without the quotation marks) at
the MS-DOS prompt to extract the files listed above from the Ndkwiz.exe file.
Copy the Dksetup.prg and Required.dbf files to the DKWIZARD subdirectory (in
your FoxPro for Windows directory), then rebuild the Setup.pjx project.

NOTE: This file is not necessary if you are using the Setup Wizard (Setup.app)
included with the Distribution Kit. You need this updated file only if you want
to modify the Setup Wizard and create a new application.

The Dksetup.prg file is one of the program files used to create Setup.app, the
Setup Wizard used to create Setup disks for applications created with the FoxPro
for Windows Distribution Kit.

Several references to old files exist in this file, including:

   #DEFINE c_eslfile     "Foxw250b.esl"
   #DEFINE c_oldesl      "Foxw2500.esl"
   #DEFINE c_oldesl1     "Foxw250a.esl"

If the Dksetup.prg file is used to create a new Setup.app application, the
following error message will appear when the Setup Wizard begins to build
disks:

   FoxPro Setup Wizard Error

Foxw250b.esl is not among the files to ship with your application. It must be on
the destination machine in order to run your application.

This problem will only affect users who build a new Setup.app file using the
Dksetup.prg file. If the Setup.app file that ships with the Distribution Kit is
used, this problem will not occur.
