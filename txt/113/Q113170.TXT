SYMPTOMS
========

When you install or delete Microsoft products, the thumbnail images in the
ClipArt Gallery may not accurately represent the picture images on your hard
drive.

For example, the ClipArt Gallery may display more than one copy of the same
graphic.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you move graphic files, attempt multiple
installations, and so on.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can refresh the thumbnail display images in ClipArt Gallery by doing the
following:

Microsoft Clip Gallery 3.0
--------------------------

1. Start Clip Gallery.

2. With the right mouse button, click any thumbnail image.

3. Click Update Clip Previews on the Context menu.

4. Click the Update All button.

Microsoft ClipArt Gallery 2.0
-----------------------------

1. Start ClipArt Gallery.

2. Click the Organize button.

3. Click the Update Pictures button.

4. Click the Update All button.

Microsoft ClipArt Gallery 1.0 and 1.1
-------------------------------------

1. Start ClipArt Gallery.

2. Click the Options button.

3. Click the Refresh button.

4. You will be prompted for a drive from which to search for graphic files.
   Insert a blank, formatted disk in either drive A or B and select the
   corresponding drive letter from the choices of drives to search. Click OK.

5. When you receive the following message:

   We do not recommend that you add clipart from this drive to the ClipArt
   Gallery because you will always need to have this disk available to put this
   clipart into your document. Do you want to add it anyway?

   click Add.

When you select a drive containing no graphic files, ClipArt Gallery refreshes
the thumbnail images, removes duplicates and thumbnails of graphics that have
been moved or deleted, and updates the ClipArt Gallery.
