TITLE   :Application Execution Error After Changing Country to Turkey
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the International settings of Country to Turkey and Language to
Turkish in Control Panel, the following error message may appear when you
restart your computer and select any of the default Windows NT or Windows NT
Advanced Server applications:

   Application Execution Error
   The path <filename> is invalid.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs due to directory names and file names that include the letter "i"
(lowercase) being changed. The character "i" is changed to a character "y" (with
an accent). Therefore, if the system root directory name for Windows NT includes
the letter "i", all applications within that directory may not run correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do the following steps to work around this problem:

1. Click the program icon once and press ALT+ENTER to display the program item
   properties.

2. Choose the Browse option button, select the file for that application, and
   then choose the OK button.

3. Make a note of the new entry on the command line, and then choose OK.

Repeat these steps for all program items that are affected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT version
3.5.
