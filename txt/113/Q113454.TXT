-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (FFAPI), version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The -W parameter allows you to specify users and files on the command line as a
method to send attachments with FFAPI. You can list files in two forms: physical
filename, or physical name followed by a comma then logical filename. If you
want to send two files, you can specify one by physical filename and the other
by physical plus logical filename.

Here are some examples of -W syntax.

1. To send more than one file to one user (each filename must be preceded by a
   space):

   -Wny4/po1/jbrown c:\dos\list1.txt c:\dos\list2.txt

2. To send more than one file to more than one user (each address must be
   separated from the next by a comma; no more than 10 spaces can precede or
   follow the comma):

   -Wny4/po1/jbrown c:\dos\list1.txt, ny4/sales/margb c:\dos\list2.txt

3. To repeat the -W option for each additional user:

   -Wny4/po1/jbrown c:\dos\list1.txt -Wlanet/sales/margb a:list2.txt

Variables:

 - ny4 is the network name

 - po1 is the PO name

 - jbrown is a userID

 - margb is a userID
