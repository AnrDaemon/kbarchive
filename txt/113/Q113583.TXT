TITLE   :SYSDIFF Does Not Remove Folders That Are Not Empty
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile kbsetup kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply a difference file to delete a folder, Sysdiff does not delete the
folder if it contains files even though the dump file states that the folder
will be deleted. For example, if you run SYSDIFF /snap on a computer that
includes one empty folder and one folder that includes files, delete these
folders, run SYSDIFF /diff, and then run SYSDIFF /apply, the empty folder is
deleted but the folder with files is not.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix below, or wait for the next service
pack. Please note that you must rebuild any packages that were built using the
previous Sysdiff.exe.

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location:

NOTE: This version of Sysdiff replaces the version that ships with Service Pack
