The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using NET START NETBEUI with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 causes the
computer to stop responding (hang) while loading Windows for Workgroups or
causes the following error message when Windows loads:

   Error 58: The network has responded incorrectly.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs if you run NET START NETBEUI before loading Windows
for Workgroups with the "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS" and NetBEUI
protocols installed.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

 - Use NET START without the NetBEUI parameter.

   -or-

 - Remove the "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS" protocol.

   -or-

 - Type "net stop netbeui" (without the quotation marks) before loading Windows
   for Workgroups. (This unloads the real-mode NetBEUI protocol.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some NetBIOS applications require the use of NET START NETBEUI to access NetBIOS
under Windows for Workgroups 3.1. Most NetBIOS applications do not require this
under Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

For example, Delrina WinFax Pro 3.0 for Networks requires NET START NETBEUI in
order for its real-mode drivers to load. Since NET START NETBEUI disables file
and print sharing in Windows for Workgroups, and can cause the above error
message, run NET START NETBEUI, load the WinFax real-mode drivers, and then run
NET STOP NETBEUI before loading Windows for Workgroups.
