The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1994 edition, 1995 edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, 1995 Intro Edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Contents to look for a specific topic, you may need to scroll down
in the article or table to find the relevant word or information.

For example, in Bookshelf 1994, if you search on the topic "Vatican Library," you
are directed to see the table "Major Modern Libraries." If you click this hot
text, Bookshelf jumps to the topic "Library." The information about the Vatican
Library is not immediately seen.

RESOLUTION
==========

To find the Major Modern Libraries table or any information relating
specifically to the Vatican library, you must scroll down in the topic.

This is by design. The Contents tool points you to specific articles, much like
the Table Of Contents in a printed book.

For more specific searches, use the Advanced Find tool on the Tools menu.
Advanced Find has a Hints button that explains how to narrow the scope of your
search.
