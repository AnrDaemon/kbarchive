SUMMARY
=======

The Day/Night Variation Range option has no effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to page 90 of the Microsoft Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook, the
Day/Night Variation Range option in the World, Weather, Temp menu should add a
realistic variance between daytime and evening temperatures.

However, no variance in temperature actually occurs, regardless of the value in
Day/Night Variation Range.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Flight Simulator version 5.0 for
MS-DOS.This problem was corrected in Flight Simulator version 5.0a.
