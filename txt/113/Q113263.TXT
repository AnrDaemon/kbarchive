SUMMARY
=======

The PRMANY sample contains code for a dynamic-link library (DLL) that can be
used to print multiple topics from a Viewer title. The sample uses the
TopicListLoad() API (application programming interface) from Viewer to load the
topic list for a group and then prints all the topics in that group. The code
could easily be modified to print any topic list--for example, it could print
the matches from a search query submitted with the TopicListFromQuery() API.

The sample also includes an .MVP file that registers the PrintGroups() function
from the DLL and creates a menu item to call it. A sample .RTF file is also
included.
