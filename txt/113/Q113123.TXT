======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows versions 1994 edition, 1995 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you turn off a button anywhere on the QuickShelf button bar and then turn it
back on, the button will appear at the right end of the button bar instead of in
its original location.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Bookshelf '96-'97 for Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, turn off all the buttons and then turn them back on
one at a time. Turn them on in the order you want them to appear on the toolbar
(from left to right).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Choose the button on the right end of the QuickShelf toolbar (the button
   labeled with a down-pointing arrow). This is the QuickShelf button.

2. From the QuickShelf menu, choose Customize.

3. Turn on all the toolbar buttons by selecting the Contents check boxes, and
   choose OK.

4. All the buttons appear on the toolbar.

5. Choose the QuickShelf button again and choose Customize.

6. Turn off one of the buttons that appears on the left or in the middle of the
   toolbar, and choose OK.

7. The button disappears.

8. Choose the QuickShelf button again and choose Customize.

9. Select the Contents check box for the button you turned off and choose OK.

The button reappears on the toolbar, but is on the right end of the toolbar
instead of in its original location.

NOTE: In Microsoft Office, a button appears in its original location if you turn
it off and then turn it back on again.
