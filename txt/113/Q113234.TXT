TITLE   :Windows Hangs with SMC Ethernet 16 Elite Ultra 16T Adapter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, the system stops
responding (hangs) after you type "win" (without the quotation marks) at the
MS-DOS command prompt when you are using the SMC Ethernet 16 Elite Ultra 16T
adapter.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Network Setup detects this network card as a
Starcard Plus and installs the driver for that card. This driver does not work
properly with the new SMC Ethernet 16 Elite Ultra 16T adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Run Windows with the network disabled. To do this type "win /n" (without the
   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.

2. Run Network Setup from the Network group.

3. Choose Drivers.

4. Select the Starcard and then choose Remove.

5. Install the correct driver for your card by choosing Add Adapter and then
   Unlisted Or Updated Driver.

6. When prompted by the system, install the updated driver provided by SMC for
   this card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Versions of SMC SuperDisk earlier than version 6.4 do not work correctly with
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. SuperDisk versions 6.4 and later ship a
corrected OEMSETUP.INF file, as well as NDIS 3 driver support. If you do not
have the latest SuperDisk or driver, you can download AWW311.EXE from the SMC
bulletin board service or the SMC forum (type "go SMC" (without the quotation
marks)) on CompuServe.

For more information, call Standard Microsystems Technical Support.

The Ethernet 16 Elite Ultra 16T adapter is manufactured by Standard Microsystems,
