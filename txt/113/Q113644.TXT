SUMMARY
=======

You can play back single-digit format from Proofreader in Excel 5.0 (for
example, one-zero-zero-zero instead of one thousand).

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Select the cell(s) to be proofread.

2. From the Format menu, choose Cells.

3. Select the Number tab and select Custom from the Category box.

4. In the Code box, type 0-0-0-0-0-0 (include the hyphens for as many zeros as
   there are digits in the largest number in the cell range).

5. Choose OK.

When the selected range of cells is proofread, the display of the numbers will be
indicated with the hyphens between them, but the numbers in each cell will be
played back one digit at a time.

To change the number format, repeat the above procedure and remove the hyphens
between the number in the Code box under the custom category.
