The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a sticker in Fine Artist is resized using the Shrinker and then enlarged
using the Grower, it looks like a bitmap, often to the point where the sticker
is no longer recognizable.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Place a sticker on a painting.

2. Click the Transformer tool.

3. Click the Shrinker tool.

4. Click and hold down the mouse button so the mouse cursor is on the sticker
   until the sticker is half its original size.

5. Click the Grower tool.

6. Click and hold down the mouse button so the mouse cursor is on the sticker
   until the sticker returns to its original size.

RESULT: The sticker looks very jagged (like a bitmap) and is distorted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a sticker is reduced in size, pixels are removed to scale down the bitmap.
When the same sticker is re-enlarged, those pixels are not replaced, and the
sticker may look as though it was assembled from square blocks. Rather than
enlarging it, once a sticker has been reduced in size, it should be removed and
replaced with a new sticker if a larger size is desired.
