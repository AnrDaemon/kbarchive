======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.0 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling SetScaleToFitSize in OnInitialUpdate of a CFormView derived class causes
the following assertion to fail:

   File viewscrl.cpp, Line 455, Assertion Failed!

CAUSE
=====

Because the view window has not yet been displayed, SetScaleToFitSize() uses the
size of the CFormView. Because the CFormView is created with size
CRect(0,0,0,0), the view size is miscalculated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To set the view window size before calling SetScaleToFitSize, call RecalcLayout
on the parent frame. For example:

      GetParentFrame()->RecalcLayout();

See the sample code below for an example of this.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Foundation Classes
(MFC) version 2.0. This problem was corrected in the Microsoft Foundation
Classes version 2.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The call to RecalcLayout in OnInitialUpdate is no longer needed with MFC version
2.5 because the framework takes care of calling RecalcLayout in response to the
WM_CREATE message before the call to OnInitialUpdate is made.

Sample Code
-----------

   /*  Compile options needed: none
   */ 

   void CMyFormView::OnInitialUpdate()
   {
       CFormView::OnInitialUpdate();     // Base class initialization.

       //GetParentFrame()->RecalcLayout  // Uncomment to fix. No need to
                                         // call if this is version 2.5.
       CSize mysize(100,100);

       SetScaleToFitSize(mysize);        // This will ASSERT in version
                                         // 2.0 unless RecalcLayout is
                                         // called.
   }
