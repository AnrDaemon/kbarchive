TITLE   :PC Adm: Requestor Name of MSMAIL Appears Corrupt
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add requestors with version 3.2, 3.2.2, or 3.2.3 of the Mail
Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) and you select MSGATE, the name of the
requestor will appear unreadable. This is not the expected behavior and was not
true in earlier versions of the Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

The MSMAIL Macintosh gateway does not need to be defined as a requestor.
Macintosh names and types can still be used and propagated through directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) without MSMAIL as a requestor. How propagation occurs
depends on the version of Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk
Networks in use.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With version 1.0b of the Mail Connection gateway, names could be placed manually
into the Dir-Sync stream by using the IMPORT.EXE -E option. Requestors that
requested MSMAIL addresses would then be sent these transactions during the
Dir-Sync cycle.

With version 3.2 of the Mail Connection gateway, the proxy NET/PO name should be
used for the MSMAIL requestor. The gateway uses this proxy name to communicate
transactions to and from the Dir-Sync process.
