KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

SUMMARY
=======

In level 104 of Chips Challenge, "The Jailer", Chip is surrounded by four
colored keys. Once Chip is moved, pink balls start rolling across the screen. If
Chip is moved onto a square that displays a key, and a pink ball moves onto the
same square at the same time, an application error will occur followed by a
general protection (GP) fault. Once the error message occurs, the Chip's
Challenge game closes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Avoid moving Chip onto a square that displays a key if, at the same time, a pink
ball moves onto that square.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Entertainment Pack volume
4.
