SYMPTOMS

When you run the Windows Sound System applications, such as Quick Recorder, a
general protection (GP) fault may occur in the video driver. Choosing OK brings
the application window back, but the Control menu and the Minimize and Maximize
commands look distorted or are not available.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by a video conflict.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem:

1. As a test, use the basic VGA driver that comes with Windows. The Windows
   Sound System applications should work correctly.

2. Update the video driver.

-or-

3. Select a lower resolution video driver.
