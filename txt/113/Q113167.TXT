SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the directory
specified by the TEMP environment variable is used when an attachment is opened
from within a mail message.

For example, if you open a Microsoft Word document, Mail first writes the file to
C:\<temp>\<file>.DOC, where <temp> is the directory specified
by the TEMP environment variable and <file> is the name of the file. Next,
Mail reads the Windows registration database and calls the application with the
following command line:

   winword.exe c:\<temp>\<file>.doc

When you close the message that contains the attachment, Mail tries to delete
this temporary file. If the file is still open in the associated application,
Mail displays the following dialog box:

   The attached file <FILE>.DOC is currently open. Further changes to that
   file will not be reflected in this message.

If you choose OK, the message closes and the attachment remains in the
C:\<temp> directory until you delete it.

If you modify the attachment and save the changes, the following dialog box
appears when the message is closed:

   Do you want to save changes to <Message Subject> in <folder
   name>?

If you choose Yes, the changes will be saved in the message that contains the
attachment, and the file in the temporary directory will be deleted. If you
choose No, the message will be closed unchanged and the temporary file will be
deleted, therefore discarding any modifications you made to the file.
