SUMMARY
=======

The Macintosh operating system allows the use of spaces and other special
characters within folder and file names. The SET PATH command, which specifies a
path for file searches, requires special syntax if folder names containing
spaces are used.

If a folder in the path contains a space character in the name, the entire path
name must be enclosed in quotation marks. Within the quotation marks, each
separate folder to search should be separated by semicolons or commas as shown
in the following example:

      SET PATH TO "Mac HD:FoxPro 2.5B; tutorial; goodies"

Additional query words: vFoxMac FoxMac directory
