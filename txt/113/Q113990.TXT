MORE INFORMATION

You may be able to add picture sets in Microsoft Scenes without receiving the

above error message does appear.

ODIHLP.EXE is a real-mode Windows for Workgroups component that allows LSL to
complete its binding process. It hooks all the real-mode entry points so that
MSODISUP.386 can use this information when working in protected mode. To use
Novell as a secondary network configured with ODI, this file must be loaded. You
cannot remove this file; if you do so, you disable all networking functionality
within Windows for Workgroups.
