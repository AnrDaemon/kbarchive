SUMMARY
=======

The SetRestartDir subroutine from the Setup Toolkit will return 0 (zero) for any
of the following reasons:

 - The restart directory has already been set by an earlier call to
   SetRestartDir from the setup script.

 - The value of the STF_CWDDIR symbol is an empty string or it is not a valid
   directory.

 - _MSSETUP.EXE is not in the STF_CWDDIR directory. This is true if MSSETUP.EXE
   is not included in the [Files] section of the SETUP.LST file.

 - _MSSETUP.EXE cannot be copied from the STF_CWDDIR directory to the restart
   directory.

 - _MSSETUP._Q_, a temporary file created in the temporary directory specified
   in SETUP.LST by SETUP.EXE, cannot be copied to the restart directory.

 - The restart directory specified is invalid. The syntax for the directory name
   is:

      drive:\[dir[\subdir...][\]]
