SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the default printer in the Windows Control Panel, Bookshelf may
retain the printer setting it had initially.

This occurs because Bookshelf incorrectly stores the Default Printer information
internally as Specific Printer information. Bookshelf ignores the Default
Printer Driver and therefore follows no change made to it.

For example, if the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet II is your default printer,
Bookshelf sets itself to print to the HP LaserJet II as Specific Printer. Then,
if you later designate a different printer as your default printer, Bookshelf
remains set to print to the HP LaserJet II and does not adopt your new printer
settings.

This problem was resolved in Microsoft Bookshelf 96-97 for Windows.
