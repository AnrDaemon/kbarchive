TITLE   :ADT2: Shortcut Menus Cannot Be Disabled in Microsoft Access
PRODUCT :Microsoft Access Distribution Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Access 2.0 
 - Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot disable, or turn off, the shortcut menus in the Microsoft Access
version 2.0 Database window. Shortcut menus are displayed by clicking the right
mouse button.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although you cannot disable shortcut menus in the Database window, you can
disable them in forms by setting the form's ShortCutMenu property to No.

The shortcut menus are also disabled when a Microsoft Access application is run
using the run-time version of Microsoft Access provided in the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit (ADT).

To prevent users from seeing the built-in toolbars, set the Built-In Toolbars
Available option to No in the Options dialog box. Note that this will not
prevent users from seeing any available custom toolbars.

To prevent users from changing custom toolbars, set the Can Customize Toolbars
option to No in the Options dialog box.

STATUS
======

This behavior no longer occurs in Microsoft Access for Windows 95, version 7.0.

REFERENCES
==========

general," and then "Options Command (View Menu)" using the Microsoft Access Help
menu.
